26275616,"For one thing, Miami is his hometown. For another, they were the only NFL team with a starting quarterback vacancy.
But neither was enough to lure Bridgewater away from the New Orleans Saints, who obviously made quite an impression on the 26-year-old quarterback after acquiring him in a trade late last August.
""I told my agents every time that I talked to them that I haven't stopped smiling since I arrived,"" said Bridgewater, who signed a one-year, $7.25 million contract worth up to $12.5 million with incentives -- even though it means spending at least one more year as a backup behind Drew Brees.
""They made playing football fun, they made learning the game fun ... and that's something I appreciate,"" Bridgewater told WWL Radio. ""I was able to be part of that for 18 weeks last season, and it was nothing but positive things that occurred.""
Free agent quarterback Teddy Bridgewater will return to the New Orleans Saints as a backup to Drew Brees, sources told ESPN on Thursday.
Bridgewater further explained on a conference call Friday that he did take time to consider the Dolphins -- including a visit to their practice facility on Wednesday -- because ""you don't want to shut all doors right away."" But he said he had a pretty good idea all along that he wanted to stay in New Orleans.
""I think for me, you ultimately play this game to compete and to start. But at the same time, I'm still 26 years old. And the way I look at it is that I'll have another opportunity to start in this league at some point,"" said Bridgewater, who began his career as a first-round draft pick and starter with the Minnesota Vikings from 2014-2015 before a devastating knee injury during the summer of 2016 sidetracked his career.
""So I look at it as this year I get the opportunity to continue to learn from a guy who's gonna be a Hall of Famer. And I get to be a part of a team that was a call away from getting to the Super Bowl. And I get to work with a coaching staff that grinds on a daily basis, that spends numerous nights at that facility to make sure their players are in the best positions to win. I look at those things, and I tell myself, 'Hey this is what I play this game for. And eventually my time will come that I can start.'""
Bridgewater missed nearly two full seasons before signing with the New York Jets last summer and proving he was healthy during the preseason. He then made his first start in three years when the Saints rested several starters in Week 17.
But he said as much as he wants to become a starter again, ""you don't want to rush yourself into any situation where you could ultimately or possibly lead back to where you are today.""
""I've always been taught that patience is the key, and for me it's about longevity,"" Bridgewater said. ""My mom always told me that the first shall be last, and the last shall be first. So I have that mindset that everything will work in my favor.""
Bridgewater did not directly say anything negative about the Dolphins' roster or chance to compete. But it's clear that they are in more of a rebuilding mode under new head coach Brian Flores.
""I wanted to make a decision where I put myself in the best situation to succeed as a man and as a player in this league,"" said Bridgewater, who said his year with the Saints was different than anything he had experienced before.
""It's very different,"" Bridgewater said. ""Just to be in a room where everyone was on the same page, from the head coach to the offensive coordinator to the quarterback coach to the starting quarterback to all the other quarterbacks in the room, to be a part of that and to see how it's run, how a well-oiled machine runs, it was great to experience that. And I'm looking forward to this year also.""
Bridgewater also didn't say that he was given any assurances of a future starting job whenever Brees retires. He said the main focus of his talk with the Saints was on this year and how they can get back in position to win a Super Bowl.
But he did say that he had discussions with coach Sean Payton before making his decision. And it's clear that Payton has been impressed with Bridgewater so far.
ESPN's Dianna Russini said she asked Payton at the NFL scouting combine which quarterback he was going after, knowing that the 40-year-old Brees' career could be over soon. And she said Payton replied, ""I have my guy. His name is Teddy Bridgewater.""
The Saints traded a third-round draft pick to the Jets last August for Bridgewater and a sixth-round pick -- both because they wanted to improve their backup QB situation and because they wanted to both evaluate and recruit Bridgewater as a possible long-term option.
So far, that investment appears to have paid off. However, Brees and Bridgewater are both scheduled to become free agents again after this season. So there will be more decisions to come at this time next year.

Veteran defensive end Adrian Clayborn tweeted that the New England Patriots have granted him his release, which was a move foreshadowed based on his rising salary-cap charge ($5.9 million) and niche role from 2018. Clayborn's release will save the Patriots about $3.5 million in cap space for 2019. He played 30 percent of the defensive snaps in the 2018 regular season, with his primary contributions coming as a rusher in obvious passing situations. Clayborn's uncertain future with the team came into focus late in the year when he was a healthy scratch for Patriots' final two games. -- Mike Reiss
The NFL is suspending Cleveland Browns running back Kareem Hunt for eight games for violating its personal conduct policy, a league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Hunt's suspension stems from a February 2018 incident in which he was shown on video shoving and kicking a woman during an early-morning altercation outside his downtown Cleveland residence.
The Browns expect Kareem Hunt to be present for the start of offseason workouts April 1. Hunt can take part in OTAs, minicamps, training camp and preseason games. His suspension will not take effect until Aug. 31, the day of final roster reductions before the season opener. Hunt was take off the commissioner's exempt list when his suspension was announced.
The Jacksonville Jaguars are signing tight end Geoff Swaim, the team announced. Swaim entered the 2018 season with nine catches for 94 yards in his first three seasons but finished last season with 26 catches for 242 yards and a touchdown, becoming a starter for the Dallas Cowboys after the retirements of Jason Witten and James Hanna.

Cornerback Brian Poole has agreed to a one-year deal with the New York Jets. Poole started 21 of 47 games, including nine last season, since entering the league as an undrafted free agent in 2016.
Cimini: Analysis for every Jets signing
Barnwell's grade: B
With Buster Skrine signing with the Bears, the Jets found a new slot corner in Brian Poole, a non-tender free agent who played three seasons with the Falcons. He's signing a one-year, $3.5 million contract, per ESPN's Adam Schefter — more than he would've made on the Atlanta tender. Poole's coverage slipped a bit last season and he committed a career-high seven penalties (five accepted). He's an excellent blitzer, which makes him a good fit in Gregg Williams' pressure scheme. Right now, the top three corners are Trumaine Johnson, Darryl Roberts and Poole. Mo Claiborne is not expected to re-sign.
Free agent quarterback Teddy Bridgewater will return to the New Orleans Saints as a backup to Drew Brees, sources told ESPN on Thursday. He will sign a one-year, $7.25 million, fully guaranteed contract with the Saints, a league source told ESPN. Sources said Bridgewater, who is from Miami, listened to and did have interest in playing for the Dolphins, with whom he met Wednesday, before ultimately deciding against a move.
The Saints’ trade for Teddy Bridgewater last summer paid off. The 26-year-old QB agreed to stay in New Orleans as a backup and potential successor to Drew Brees rather than leave for an immediate starting opportunity with the Dolphins, according to ESPN’s Dianna Russini. It remains to be seen how long the 40-year-old Brees plans to keep playing – and how long the Saints will be willing to keep paying both QBs. But both sides obviously liked the fit last season after the Saints traded a third-round pick in exchange for Bridgewater and a sixth-rounder in late August.

The San Francisco 49ers have signed free agent receiver Jordan Matthews to a one-year deal. Matthews, 26, appeared in 14 games and posted 20 receptions for 300 yards with two touchdowns in Philadelphia last season.
Wagoner: Analysis for every 49ers signing
The 49ers added to their needy receiver corps on Thursday, signing Jordan Matthews to a one-year deal. Matthews instantly becomes one of the biggest targets on the roster and could improve the team's woeful red zone offense, which ranked last in the league in 2018 in touchdown percentage. At 6'3, Matthews offers good size and 16 of his 22 career touchdowns have come inside the opponent's 20.
The Kansas City Chiefs have agreed to a three-year contract with defensive end Alex Okafor, a source told ESPN. Okafor will help the Chiefs' pass rush after the team released linebacker Justin Houston and traded linebacker Dee Ford to the San Francisco 49ers.
Teicher: Analysis for every Chiefs signing
Barnwell's grade: C-
The Chiefs’ contract agreement with Alex Okafor gives them a veteran defensive end for their new 4-3 base defensive system. Okafor, who has 22 sacks in six NFL seasons with the Cardinals and the Saints, hasn’t been a prolific pass rusher. But they believe he can improve his production. He had four sacks in 16 starts last season for New Orleans.
The Oakland Raiders began clearing salary-cap space after their spending spree, releasing wide receiver Jordy Nelson and quarterback AJ McCarron on Thursday, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The release of Nelson comes after the Raiders spent big at the wide receiver position by acquiring Antonio Brown in a trade and then restructuring his contract to give him more money, and signing Tyrell Williams to a four-year contract.
The New York Giants began to try to fill the void left when they traded wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. by agreeing to a deal with Golden Tate on Thursday. It's a four-year, $37.5 million deal that includes $23 million fully guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Golden Tate is an interesting signing in Pat Shurmur's offense that includes a lot of crossing routes. He ""turns into a RB with the ball in his hands,"" according to a scout who knows him well. Tate uses his size to his advantage and breaks a lot of tackles. He's an interesting complement to TE Evan Engram and WR Sterling Shepard. The Giants still have no shortage of weapons.
The Carolina Panthers have released left tackle Matt Kalil. The move comes after the team re-signed offensive tackle Daryl Williams to a one-year contract. The team also signed center Matt Paradis to a three-year contract.

Barnwell's grade: A
Free agent safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix has agreed to a one-year deal with the Chicago Bears, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter and others. The Bears will be Clinton-Dix's third team since the start of the 2018 season. He'll have a chance to replace Adrian Amos, who signed a lucrative deal this week with the Green Bay Packers. Clinton-Dix, a 2014 first-round pick of the Packers, was a Pro Bowl player in 2016 but his play dipped since then. The Packers traded him to the Washington Redskins midway through last season.
The New Orleans Saints have agreed to a three-year contract with former New England Patriots defensive tackle Malcom Brown, a source told ESPN. The move comes after Drew Brees restructured his contract to create more than $10 million in salary-cap space for the Saints.
Triplett: Analysis for every Saints signing
The Saints filled one of their biggest needs by agreeing to a three-year deal with former Patriots starting DT Malcom Brown, a source confirmed. The deal was first reported by the NFL Network. Brown (6-2, 320 pounds) should replace free agent Tyeler Davison as the Saints' starting nose tackle, but he also has the versatility to be a penetrating DT. He has 8.5 sacks in four seasons. The Saints have some depth concerns at their other DT spot, where starter Sheldon Rankins is recovering from a torn Achilles and backup David Onyemata could potentially face league discipline for a marijuana possession charge.
The San Francisco 49ers are signing former Los Angeles Chargers cornerback Jason Verrett to a one-year, $3.6 million deal, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Verrett suffered an Achilles tendon tear during a conditioning test a day before the start of Chargers' training camp last year, forcing the TCU product to miss the entire 2018 season.

The New Orleans Saints created more than $10 million in salary-cap space by restructuring quarterback Drew Brees' contract -- which has become almost an annual ritual for a team that is routinely slammed tight against the cap. The team also has visits planned for Thursday:
While most teams started free agency with a flurry, the Saints are just getting warmed up – with some major decisions coming in the next few days. They have visits scheduled with top TE Jared Cook, standout edge rusher Ezekiel Ansah and defensive lineman Mario Edwards. And they're still waiting on a decision from backup QB Teddy Bridgewater, who visited the Dolphins on Wednesday. The Saints restructured Drew Brees' contract to carve out some salary-cap room for at least one or two more big moves to come.

Wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who was traded from the New York Giants to the Cleveland Browns, thanked the Giants organization on Instagram:
 So many mixed emotions and feelings. This is all, a lot to process but it is reality. I don't kno exactly what to say so just gotta keep it real and short.

The New York Jets are bringing back defensive tackle Steve McLendon:
By retaining locker-room favorite Steve McLendon, the Jets helped their depth on the defensive line. At 33, he's a first- and second-down player who can play 20 to 30 snaps a game. He's probably a better rotational player at this point in his career. He played 42 percent of the snaps in 2018, and saw a slight decline in his production: His work ethic is contagious, and he's great for team chemistry. The starting defensive line remains intact, with Henry Anderson also returning, but there could be a big addition in the draft, Quinnen Williams or maybe Nick Bosa.

The Jacksonville Jaguars waived quarterback Blake Bortles on Wednesday, cutting ties with the player they took third overall in 2014 after five tumultuous seasons, just hours after signing free-agent quarterback Nick Foles. The move will cost the Jaguars $16.5 million in dead money but also save the team $4.3 million against the salary cap in 2019. Bortles was guaranteed to make $6.5 million this season and was due a $1 million roster bonus on the fifth day of the league year.
DiRocco: Bortles was one of best QBs in Jaguars history
Releasing Blake Bortles without a post-June 1 designation means the Jaguars will absorb a $16.5 million dead cap hit and save only $4.5 million. Bortles was guaranteed $6.5 million this year. He also was due a $1 million roster bonus on the fifth day of the 2019 league year (Sunday), but obviously will not receive that now. The Jaguars now have four quarterbacks under contract for 2019: Nick Foles, Cody Kessler, Tanner Lee, and Alex McGough.
Even as they signal a commitment to a rebuilding plan, the New York Giants still do not plan to move on from 38-year-old quarterback Eli Manning this year, according to multiple sources familiar with their plan. Manning has one year left on his contract. He is scheduled to earn an $11.5 million salary, a $500,000 workout bonus and a $5 million roster bonus if he is still on the roster at 4 p.m. ET Sunday.

The San Francisco 49ers are signing running back Tevin Coleman to a two-year, $10 million deal, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Coleman, known as an explosive, big-play threat, averaged a career-best 4.8 yards per carry while starting 14 of 16 games for the Atlanta Falcons in 2018 as two-time Pro Bowler Devonta Freeman underwent season-ending groin surgery. Coleman finished the season with 800 yards and four touchdowns on 167 attempts, and he also caught 32 passes for 276 yards and five TDs. The 49ers also agreed to terms to re-sign defensive back Jimmie Ward on a one-year deal worth up to $5 million, league sources told ESPN's Nick Wagoner, confirming an earlier report.

The signing of Tyrann Mathieu, as it turns out, does mean the end for Eric Berry with the Chiefs. They've released him, even though the salary cap savings will only be $1.5 million. What could have been? Berry was with Chiefs for nine years but missed almost all of four seasons because of injury or illness. Interested to see what is next for hm.
The Miami Dolphins continued their roster purge at the start of the league year Wednesday by releasing veteran guard Josh Sitton. Sitton is likely to wind up with the New York Jets, a source tells ESPN's Adam Schefter. There he would reunite with former Dolphins and current Jets coach Adam Gase.

Keim: Analysis for every Redskins signing
Barnwell's grade: C
The Redskins made a solid and necessary move by re-signing running back Adrian Peterson to a two-year deal worth up to $8 million. It's uncertain how much is guaranteed but there likely will be plenty of incentives. However, with Derrius Guice coming off a torn ACL - and having had knee issues in the past -- the Redskins need to be covered just in case he's not the same player. Or if it takes him time to handle a full load. Peterson would be a good mentor for Guice -- if he pays attention to the NFL's eighth all-time leading rusher. Peterson's work ethic and study habits impressed teammates and coaches in Washington last season. And he showed he could still play with 1,042 yards including 119 in a Week 16 loss at Tennessee. Peterson might not hit the consistent home runs anymore, but he can still elude defenders for extra yards. Peterson might be 34, but he still has something to offer.
The Atlanta Falcons informed former starting right tackle Ryan Schraeder of his release, agent Joel Turner told ESPN. Schraeder, who lost his job to Ty Sambrailo at the end of last season, had three years and $18.8 million remaining on his contract. His release saves $3.95 million against the Falcons' 2019 cap.

Ravens reach a four-year, $55 million deal with safety Earl Thomas, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. This gives Baltimore its best ballhawk since soon-to-be Hall of Famer Ed Reed left after the 2012 Super Bowl season. The Ravens' first major signing in free agency will fill the void left by Eric Weddle, who was cut last week. Thomas, 30 has drawn comparisons to Reed throughout his career because of his great range. He has intercepted 28 passes and gone to six Pro Bowls in nine seasons with the Seattle Seahawks. He always covered lots of ground in a one deep safety defense, which would allow safety Tony Jefferson to play closer to the line of scrimmage. The concern with Thomas is durability. His left leg has been broken twice (in 2016 and 2018), and he has missed 19 games over the past three seasons. But Thomas never missed a game from 2010 to 2015. After last year's top-ranked defense lost five key members in free agency, the arrival of Thomas is a step toward rebuilding it.

This is a homecoming for Bolden, who played for the Patriots from 2012-2017 before spending the 2018 season in Miami after being cut by New England right before the season. Had Bolden not left for Miami, he probably would have returned to the Patriots one week later after RB Jeremy Hill tore his ACL in the season-opener and New England needed reinforcements. Bolden, 29, is more of a reserve and strong special teams and locker-room presence. His return should be well received by teammates from a culture standpoint. NFL Network first reported the agreement between the Patriots and Bolden.

Now they incur another $16 million in dead money and paid him $21.5 million for 12 games. Last year was the ideal time to rebuild if that is the direction the organization was going.

Henry Anderson, one of GM Mike Maccagnan's best finds, isn't going anywhere. Good move for both sides to continue the marriage — a three-year, $25M deal. You could argue he was their most effective defensive linemen last season. He recorded a career-high seven sacks despite being doubled on a team-high 60 percent of the snaps, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Anderson is a good fit in Gregg Williams' 3-4, and he can slide inside on passing downs. He's only 27, so he's in his prime years.

Although Brown played every game and almost 98 percent of the defensive snaps in Buffalo, he played only seven games in Cincinnati.
Terrell: Analysis of every Bengals signing
The Bengals have re-signed LB Preston Brown, according to ESPN's Dianna Russini. It's hard to judge his 2018 season. Brown never really got a chance to show what he could do in Cincinnati after getting injured Week 1 and then ultimately ending up on IR for a different injury. Prior to coming to the Bengals, he had never missed a game. Brown took a one-year deal last year because he wanted to be in Cincinnati. If the Bengals don't make any other moves with the LBs, then the 2019 linebackers are WLB Vontaze Burfict, MLB Preston Brown and SLB Nick Vigil. But this certainly doesn't mean the Bengals aren't still looking or potentially thinking about drafting a linebacker, considering Burfict hasn't been very reliable or available for much of the last few years.
Former Arizona Cardinals safety Deone Bucannon has reached agreement on a one-year deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

McClure: Analysis of every Falcons signing
Falcons addressing the offensive line via free agency. Adam Schefter reports the team is signing former Jets left guard James Carpenter to a four-year contract. Carpenter has 97 career starts with both the Jets and Seattle Seahawks, primarily at left guard. As ESPN's Rich Cimini noted, Carpenter coming off shoulder surgery and didn't finish the season. Falcons also set to sign guard Jamon Brown to a three-year deal, a source told ESPN. Brown started eight games for the Giants at right guard last season. Falcons not content with what they have at guard next to Alex Mack with Wes Schweitzer more of a backup and Brandon Fusco coming back from a broken ankle. This probably means the Falcons will address defensive tackle with the 14th overall pick in the draft despite interest in Oklahoma's Cody Ford and others.

The Buffalo Bills intend to sign former Washington Redskins offensive tackle Ty Nsekhe to a free-agent deal Wednesday, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The deal is for two years and worth $14.5 million with $7.7 million guaranteed, his agent Vincent Taylor said. Nsekhe was the Redskins' swing tackle the past four seasons -- never the full-time starter -- but that sort of money indicates Nsekhe will replace free agent Jordan Mills as the Bills' starting right tackle.

The New England Patriots have placed an original-round tender on suspended/restricted free-agent WR Josh Gordon ($2.025 million). This counts against the team's salary cap. So if Gordon is ever reinstated by the NFL, he would be looking at a one-year, $2.025 million contract. Technically, another team could sign him to an offer sheet, and if the Patriots didn't match it, the club would receive a second-round draft pick in return because that's the round in which Gordon entered the NFL. But draft-pick compensation, and financial terms of a contract, are naturally secondary to Gordon's health and well-being at this point.

The Jets struck again in a big way, adding Pro Bowl LB CJ Mosley to their new-look linebacking corps. He will join Anthony Barr and Avery Williamson, and it raises questions about the futures of Jordan Jenkins and Darron Lee — especially Lee. Mosley is a terrific player who will bring toughness and tackling ability, but the contract is exorbitant— five years, $85M, including a $51M guarantee. Normally, you have those contracts for elite pass rushers. Mosley is many things, but he's not that.
In a span of a week, the NFL's top-ranked defense has now lost its two signal-callers in C.J. Mosley and safety Eric Weddle along with its most tenured player in linebacker Terrell Suggs. Mosley, Weddle and Suggs have combined for 460 NFL starts and 17 Pro Bowls.

A longtime face of the Baltimore Ravens' defense is saying goodbye. Outside linebacker Terrell Suggs told members of the Ravens on Monday he is moving on, a source told ESPN. One of the top leaders and characters in franchise history, he had spent his entire 16-year NFL career in Baltimore.
Terrell Suggs informed the Ravens that he's signing elsewhere, and this departure will be felt more than any other in Baltimore this offseason. For 16 years, Suggs was as much a part of the Ravens' storied defensive tradition as Ray Lewis and Ed Reed. The best way to put it is this: Lewis was the heart, Reed was the soul and Suggs was the funny bone. One of the biggest personalities in team history, Suggs was a seven-time Pro Bowl player and the 2011 defensive rookie of the year. He is the only active player with 900 tackles, 100 sacks and 30 forced fumbles. Suggs often talked about how he wanted to be a ""Raven for life"" and spend his entire career in Baltimore like Lewis and Jonathan Ogden. Instead, he'll finish out a potential Hall of Fame career somewhere else like Reed and Haloti Ngata.
Former Baltimore Ravens DE Terrell Suggs, who is expected to sign with the Arizona Cardinals, had 132.5 sacks in his Ravens career, tied with Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor for the third-most by any player with a single franchise, trailing only Bruce Smith (171) with the Bills and Michael Strahan (141.5) with the Giants since sacks became official in 1982.

Carson Wentz will have some fun airing it out to Jackson, and it should open up even more space for guys like Zach Ertz across the middle.
The Jacksonville Jaguars will sign former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles to a four-year deal worth $88 million, according to ESPN and multiple sources. The deal includes $50.125 million in guaranteed money, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Barnwell's grade: C-
The $50.125 million in guaranteed money (per ESPN's Adam Schefter) the Jaguars are giving QB Nick Foles is the largest amount of guaranteed money in franchise history. DT Malik Jackson, who was released last week, got $42 million guaranteed when he signed in 2016. Foles was the Jaguars' top target and the contract shows they're clearly committed to him as their starter beyond 2020, and it also likely takes quarterback off the board in the first round of the draft, even if Dwayne Haskins were to slip to them at No. 7.
The Tennessee Titans intend to sign safety Kenny Vaccaro to a contract to remain in Nashville on a four-year contract worth $26 million, with $11.5 million guaranteed, according to multiple reports.

Rothstein: Analysis for every Lions signing
The Detroit Lions are all about business here on the first day of the legal tampering period, agreeing to terms with their third free agent of need (not counting Danny Amendola, who signed Monday) by snagging tight end Jesse James from Pittsburgh. James was one of the top tight ends in a somewhat underwhelming tight end market but he will solve an obvious hole for Detroit at the position. Both Bob Quinn and Matt Patricia identified tight end as a definitive position of need and went out and got a good one in James. James has 120 career catches for 1,189 yards and nine touchdowns with the Steelers. He should immediately slide into the No. 1 tight end spot and give Matthew Stafford a tall target in the red zone at 6-foot-7.

Barnwell's grade: C+
Bob Quinn needed a pass rusher. He found one in Trey Flowers, the top edge rusher on the market and one that both he and Lions head coach Matt Patricia are familiar with. Patricia nabbed a player who he is very familiar with and is a player who knows Detroit's defense. Flowers can move all around the Lions' defense and will pair with Romeo Okwara to become a strong pair of edge rushers. This is the move the Lions had to get done and three hours after the legal tampering period could begin, they got it accomplished.
Former New York Giants Pro Bowl safety Landon Collins told ESPN's Josina Anderson he will sign with the Washington Redskins. The deal is for six years, $84 million, including $45 million in guaranteed money, according to multiple reports.

The Redskins will be signing safety Landon Collins, who told ESPN's Josina Anderson the news. He'll receive a deal worth up to $84 million for six years, per multiple reports. That's serious money and partly a function of their inability to draft and develop anyone at this position for most of the past decade. But he gives them one of the best in-the-box safeties in the NFL and also someone who can help improve the culture and leadership on Washington's defense. That was sorely needed. He also grew up a big fan of late Redskins safety Sean Taylor and wore his number 21 with the New York Giants.

Barnwell's grade: D+
The 49ers strike early and heavily in free agency as they intend to sign LB Kwon Alexander to a four-year, $54 million deal, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Alexander should fit in at the team's WIL linebacker spot alongside Fred Warner. While Alexander makes sense for the Niners, the cost here is exorbitant and not just in terms of Alexander's money. This is the price the Niners are paying for the swing and a miss on Reuben Foster. Foster was supposed to be the guy to hold this job and because he couldn't avoid trouble, the Niners found themselves having to spend big at the position. The trickle down effect of that could mean they're unable to fill other holes on their defense.
The Cleveland Browns have released tight end Darren Fells. He spent one year in Cleveland and had 11 catches for 117 yards and three touchdowns. David Njoku, Seth DeValve, Pharaoh Brown and Orson Charles are on the roster at the position.
Here's what the Dallas Cowboys are planning at the start of free agency:
Clearly, it’s early on in the legal tampering period, but the sense is that things will be quiet with the Cowboys in the next few days in free agency. The focus is still on their own players, especially DeMarcus Lawrence. While everybody wants to connect the Earl Thomas dots, the feeling is the price will be a lot more than what the Cowboys want to pay.
The Arizona Cardinals will release veteran tight end Jermaine Gresham on Thursday for cap reasons, according to ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. Gresham's cap hit was to be $8.2 million in 2019. Gresham had a career-low nine catches for 94 yards in 2018.
The Philadelphia Eagles signed left tackle Jason Peters to a new one-year contract Monday, keeping the veteran in the fold for 2019.

The Los Angeles Rams announced on Sunday that they've agreed to terms on a new deal with outside linebacker Dante Fowler Jr. The club didn't release terms, but ESPN's Adam Schefter reported the deal is for one year.

Fowler joined the team midseason after he was traded from the Jacksonville Jaguars, but was set to become an unrestricted free agent. In 8 regular season games, Fowler had 2 sacks, a pass deflection and a forced fumble. He also had a key pressure in overtime of the NFC Championship game that forced Drew Brees into an errant throw that S John Johnson III intercepted. The Rams have settled two pressing offseason needs before the start of free agency by agreeing to terms with Fowler and signing safety Eric Weddle.
The Oakland Raiders have agreed to a two-year contract with defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Breeland Speaks is the player who stands to benefit the most from Justin Houston's departure. The Chiefs moved up last year in the second round to draft Speaks in the second round, in part in anticipation of losing either Houston or Dee Ford this year. The Chiefs used Speaks as an outside linebacker in their base 3-4 defense last year but he will be a defensive end in their 4-3 system under new cooordinator Steve Spagnuolo. ""Most people and even our organization too, thought his natural fit was more of a 4-3 D-end,'' general manager Brett Veach said last month shortly after Spagnuolo was hired.
The Detroit Lions will be looking for a new starting cornerback, as the club is releasing Nevin Lawson days before the start of the new league year, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Lawson was a consistent if not flashy cornerback for the Lions. A fourth-round pick by the Lions in 2014, he played in 62 games for Detroit, starting 54 of them, including being a full-time starter over the past three seasons with the club.

The Pittsburgh Steelers have agreed to trade prolific but disgruntled receiver Antonio Brown to the Oakland Raiders in exchange for a third- and fifth-round pick, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Brown will receive a new three-year deal worth up to $54.125 million from the Raiders, with $30.125 million guaranteed, the source said. He previously had three years and $38.9 million left on his contract with the Steelers, with none of the money guaranteed.

The Pittsburgh Steelers will be relieved but probably not elated with the draft haul in the Antonio Brown trade. They sought what GM Kevin Colbert called ‘significant' compensation and walked away with a third- and a fifth-round pick, which hardly guarantees finding a star receiver to replace Brown. But Pittsburgh's options were limited by Brown's contract demands and behavior over the last few months. Many teams dropped out. At least now they can move on with a new era of Steelers football, beginning with the re-signing of Ben Roethlisberger.
It didn't take long for running back Carlos Hyde to find another job, as he agreed to a one-year deal with the Kansas City Chiefs on Saturday, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The deal is for $2.8 million, with $1.6 million being guaranteed, a source told Schefter.
Newly signed Carlos Hyde may fill the RB2 spot occupied at the end of last season by Spencer Ware, who is headed to free agency. But Hyde could eventually claim a significant amount of playing time from Damien Williams, who for now at least is the Chiefs’ main featured back. Hyde at 235 pounds is a big, versatile back of the type favored by general manager Brett Veach. “We certainly like bigger backs,’’ Veach said recently at the NFL combine. “I kind of have a thing for 220-pound backs that can run and catch and block.’’ The Chiefs could also draft a back, though it’s not the necessity it was before the Hyde signing. “When you get into rounds 2 and 3, we have our eyes on a couple of (running backs),’’ Veach said. “Certainly we’d be happy with a few guys.’’

Allen, who spent the last two seasons with the New England Patriots, becomes the most experienced and accomplished tight end on the Dolphins roster. 

He had three catches for 27 yards in 13 games (eight starts) last season with the Patriots. Allen's best skillset is as a blocker and he will likely compete with 2018 second-round pick Mike Gesicki for Miami's starting tight end job.

The Detroit Lions released veteran guard T.J. Lang on Friday with one year left on his contract -- ending a question that had lingered throughout the offseason. Lions general manager Bob Quinn said at the NFL scouting combine last week that the team was still deciding on what to do with the former Pro Bowler, whom the team signed to a three-year deal before the 2017 season.
The Lions releasing T.J. Lang does give the franchise a little bit more than $8.5 million more in cap space but it also creates a large hole on the offensive line. Detroit will have some flexibility since both Frank Ragnow and Graham Glasgow can play guard and center, so the club can go after whichever interior offensive linemen they would think fits best in the draft or free agency. And there was little way Detroit could have justified keeping Lang with the $11 million-plus cap hit he would have be on the books for in 2019. 
Lang was a smart addition at the time for the Lions and when he was healthy, he was outstanding -- including a Pro Bowl appearance. But injuries were the main issue with the Michigan native and the franchise just couldn't have relied on him again.
When it comes to free agency, this extra money could give Detroit some flexibility to go after a high-level option like Landon Collins or Trey Flowers. Denver center Matt Paradis, Bills guard John Miller, Chiefs center Mitch Morse and Rams guard Rodger Saffold are the best potential offensive line options in free agency.
The Jacksonville Jaguars released five players on Friday, headlined by defensive tackle Malik Jackson, a move that will save the team $30 million. In addition to Jackson, the Jaguars also released safety Tashaun Gipson, running back Carlos Hyde, right tackle Jermey Parnell and long-snapper Carson Tinker. The moves were made, in part, to create salary-cap space to sign a veteran quarterback, expected to be Nick Foles.

That said the Broncos will still pay $4 million cash to ship Keenum to the Redskins after he was their starter for just one season.
The Antonio Brown sweepstakes hasn't stopped the Pittsburgh Steelers from doing big business with their big people.

A source confirms Foster is signing for two years and is worth $8.25 million.
Veteran wide receiver Pierre Garcon will become a free agent after the San Francisco 49ers passed on his option for 2019, the team announced Thursday. The 49ers opted to take on $7.2 million in dead money rather than carry Garcon's cap number of $8.275 million. In two seasons with the Niners, Garcon had 64 catches for 786 yards with one touchdown while appearing in 16 games.
The Miami Dolphins are diving headfirst into a rebuild, with the first step being to get cumbersome veteran contracts off the books. They started that process Thursday by releasing defensive end Andre Branch and guard Ted Larsen. The moves will save Miami $9.15 million in salary-cap space.

The Cleveland Browns have released linebacker Jamie Collins Sr., the team announced Wednesday. Releasing Collins will cost the Browns only $2.5 million in salary-cap space this season and saves the Browns $9.25 million in cap costs in 2019 and $13.75 million in 2020. Collins had been due to earn $10 million in salary in 2019 and $12 million in 2020.
The Browns choice right now to step in for Jamie Collins would be Genard Avery, who got a lot of time as a rookie after Christian Kirksey was placed on injured reserve. Avery could stand up on early downs, then rush in passing downs. On the free agent market, C.J. Mosley, who played inside for the Ravens, and Anthony Barr (Vikings) seem the most expensive options.  Preston Smith of the Redskins is well thought of, and Kwon Alexander played well in Tampa Bay and is on the road to recovery after tearing his ACL in the Bucs win over the Browns in October.
The Denver Broncos, in need of salary-cap space before free agency opens, have informed safety Darian Stewart that he'll be released. Stewart, who had two years remaining on his four-year extension through 2020, was slated to count $6.37 million against the salary cap in 2019.

The Atlanta Falcons have placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on defensive tackle Grady Jarrett. General manager Thomas Dimitroff said last week using the tag would be a possibility with the 25-year-old Jarrett as Jarrett heads into his fifth NFL season. Dimitroff has been in talks with Jarrett's agent, Todd France, regarding a long-term contract extension, yet the sides remain far apart.

The Seattle Seahawks placed the franchise tag on defensive end Frank Clark on Monday, ensuring that Seattle's top pass-rusher will now stay put through at least the 2019 season. The Seahawks' announcement that they've tagged Clark specifies that it's the non-exclusive tag, as expected. It means Clark is free to negotiate with other teams. If he were to sign an offer sheet that the Seahawks declined to match, Seattle would be entitled to two first-round picks from the other team.
Franchise tag tracker: What's behind SEA tagging Clark
The Seahawks are using the franchise tag on Frank Clark, according to ESPN's Dan Graziano and others. It means Clark remains under contract for at least another season at a salary of $17.128 million. The two sides can continue to negotiate a long-term deal until July 15. Signing Clark long-term would be beneficial to the Seahawks from a short-term cap standpoint as it would lower Clark's 2019 cap charge from the $17.128 million. It would also free up the franchise tag for the Seahawks to use it next year on Russell Wilson if they're unable to sign their quarterback to an extension before then. But with the tag at their disposal in 2019, there was no way the Seahawks were going to let Clark walk. This was the expected move.
Unable to reach an agreement on a long-term deal before the deadline, the Dallas Cowboys on Monday used the franchise-tag designation on Pro Bowl defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence for the second consecutive year, a source confirmed. Unlike last year, the Cowboys hope to work out an extension with Lawrence before the July 15 deadline to play the season on the tag.
Archer: Tag in place, what's next for Cowboys, DeMarcus Lawrence?
Franchise tag tracker: What's behind DAL tagging Lawrence
The next key date in the DeMarcus Lawrence talks is July 15. If he doesn’t have a long-term deal done, then he will have to play the season on the $20.5 million tag. The Cowboys want to get a long-term deal done and there are indications talks will continue. In 2015, the Cowboys worked out a five-year, $70 million deal with Dez Bryant minutes before the July deadline. Bryant took part only sparingly in the offseason program. A source said Lawrence will not take part in any work without a long-term deal after signing the $17.1 million tag quickly in 2018. The last time the Cowboys used the tag in consecutive years on a player came in 2012-13 with outside linebacker Anthony Spencer.
The Philadelphia Eagles and starting left guard Isaac Seumalo agreed to a three-year contract extension on Monday, the team announced. Seumalo, 25, is the second Eagles starting offensive lineman to receive an extension this offseason, joining center Jason Kelce, who agreed to a one-year extension on Saturday that put him under contract through 2021.
The Houston Texans have used their franchise tag on defensive end/outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney, the team announced Monday. The team used the non-exclusive franchise designation, meaning a team can sign Clowney to an offer sheet once free agency begins next week but would have to surrender two first-round draft picks if the Texans choose not to match it.
Barshop: Why the Texans should sign Jadeveon Clowney to long-term deal
Franchise tag tracker: What's behind Houston tagging Clowney
Jadeveon Clowney is listed as a DE/OLB because he plays all over the field for the Texans, but according to ESPN Stats & Info, in 2018 he played 729 snaps at DE, 101 snaps at DT and 33 at LB.
The Tennessee Titans are expected to release safety Johnathan Cyprien sometime this week, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The Titans would like Cyprien back, but for less money than the $5.5 million base salary he was scheduled to be paid in 2019.
Barring any last-minute snags, the Jacksonville Jaguars are expected to sign the free-agent quarterback to a multiyear contract when the new league year opens next week, according to sources. The Jaguars are expected to release quarterback Blake Bortles and install Foles as their starter. Jacksonville will have to pay $6.5 million of Bortles' 2019 salary, which was fully guaranteed when he signed his current contract last year.
DiRocco: With Foles on way, Jaguars' draft focus shifts to TE, WR, OL
The San Francisco 49ers and starting right guard Mike Person have reached agreement on a three-year, $9 million deal that includes $3 million guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Person was scheduled to become a free agent. The 49ers signed Person late in June of last year with hopes that he could offer some depth and versatility as a backup on the offensive line. As it turned out, Person provided much more than that, starting all 16 games at right guard.
The Kansas City Chiefs are placing their franchise tag on linebacker Dee Ford and plan to have him in their lineup this season, but with the change to a 4-3 defensive scheme, they will listen to trade offers for him, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The Chiefs intend to switch their base defensive scheme to a 4-3 under new coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, which likely would mean a move to defensive end for Ford, who played that position in college before moving to linebacker for Kansas City.
Franchise-tag tracker: What's behind KC tagging Ford
It's not a surprise that the Chiefs would name LB Dee Ford their franchise player, as ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported they will. What is a surprise is Schefter’s report that the Chiefs would listen to trade offers for Ford. That suggests the Chiefs are looking to unload either of last season’s two edge rushers, Ford and Justin Houston, and install Breeland Speaks as a starter at defensive end in their new 4-3 base scheme. The Chiefs drafted Speaks in the second round last year.
The Atlanta Falcons and backup quarterback Matt Schaub have agreed to a two-year contract extension, the team announced Saturday. Schaub, who turns 38 in June, signed to be Matt Ryan's backup prior to the 2016 season. He has played in seven games over the past three seasons, completing 6 of 10 passes for 36 yards.
Despite some end-of-season speculation that he could retire this offseason, Eagles center Jason Kelce has reached an agreement on a one-year contract extension that ties him to Philadelphia through 2021. According to sources, the extension adds $11 million in new money. Kelce had two years remaining on a seven-year contract he signed in 2014.
Jason Kelce said the Eagles originally approached him about a restructure during the season. He had a difficult year because of injury and, now 31, took some time to ponder future before deciding not to retire. The move gives him a bump in pay and frees up cap space for Eagles.
The Jacksonville Jaguars are attempting to trade running back Carlos Hyde and defensive tackle Malik Jackson, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Hyde was traded to the Jaguars by the Cleveland Browns last season, and he rushed for 189 yards on 58 carries in eight games with Jacksonville. Jackson has been in Jacksonville since 2016 after signing a six-year contract worth up to $90 million. He has totaled 18 sacks over the past three seasons.
The Detroit Lions had to make a potential restricted free-agency decision on defensive end Romeo Okwara. On Friday, the team bypassed all of that, signing him to a new, two-year deal instead. Okwara, 23, was a massive find for Detroit last season after he was claimed off waivers following his release by the Giants during the cutdown churn in September. He started 14 games for the Lions and led the franchise with 7.5 sacks.
Teams that have communicated with the New York Giants are under the impression they are trying to trade outside linebacker Olivier Vernon, sources told ESPN. Vernon is set to make $15.5 million this season. His current deal has two years and $31 million remaining.
Olivier Vernon is a contract from the old regime, when the Giants signed him to play as a defensive end in a 4-3 base. They played a 3-4 more frequently last year, and while Vernon was quietly great to end the season -- he had six sacks and 13 knockdowns over his final five games -- it's not a surprise that the Giants would look to shed his $19.5 million cap hold. They can create $11.5 million by trading or releasing Vernon, and while they'll unquestionably look for a trade partner, the two years and $31 million left on Vernon's deal suggest the latter is more likely to happen.
The Philadelphia Eagles have agreed to terms on a three-year extension with defensive end Brandon Graham, the team announced Friday. The new deal, which will keep Graham with the Eagles through the 2021 season, is worth $40 million, a source told ESPN's Tim McManus.
Barnwell's grade: C+
Jason Witten is returning to the Dallas Cowboys, the team announced Thursday. Witten is leaving ESPN's Monday Night Football and returning to the playing field less than a year after announcing his retirement. Sources told ESPN that the tight end is getting a one-year deal worth $3.5 million that can max out at $5 million, including roster bonuses and incentives.
Archer: What Witten's return means for Cowboys on and off the field
Archer: Jones lauds Witten as coach-in-waiting
After making a stunning return to the NFL, Jason Witten will have a role to play in the Cowboys offense. Dak Prescott ranked 27th in passer rating on throws between the hashes within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage last year. The 36-year-old tight end was last in yards per reception among regular tight ends during the final three seasons of his pro career before retiring, but Witten caught more than 70 percent of his targets over each of those seasons. Witten's one-year, $3.5-million deal gives the Cowboys a safe pair of hands and a very reasonably-paid solution at a position of need for many teams around the NFL.
One year after making a blockbuster trade to move up in the draft, the New York Jets are willing to go in reverse if the price is right. General manager Mike Maccagnan, speaking to reporters Wednesday at the NFL scouting combine, put a ""for sale"" sign on the Jets' pick, third overall.
The Jacksonville Jaguars and Marcell Dareus have agreed to a restructured contract that will keep the nose tackle with the team next season. The deal clears $5 million in cap space for the Jaguars and lowers Dareus' base salary from $8.335 million in 2019, sources told ESPN's Field Yates. Dareus was scheduled to earn a $2 million roster bonus on March 15 but now gets a $5 million bonus immediately. The restructured contract runs through the 2020 season, eliminating the final year of the old contract.
Kicker Robbie Gould, one of the first free agents signed by the San Francisco 49ers when coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch took over in 2017, will be around for at least one more season after he received the team's franchise tag on Tuesday.
Franchise-tag tracker: What's behind SF tagging Gould
The Dallas Cowboys have made their first offer to defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, and executive vice president Stephen Jones is hopeful that a long-term deal can be reached with the Pro Bowl defensive end. ""I'm confident we'll get a deal done,"" Jones said in a break between competition committee meetings in Indianapolis. ""I don't know the timing, but I'm very confident we can get a deal done. Everybody's on the record, from Jerry [Jones] to myself to Jason Garrett to Will [McClay], on what we think of D-Law.""
Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Quinn put to rest speculation about the roster status of pass-rusher Vic Beasley Jr., telling ESPN that keeping Beasley for the 2019 season is ""the plan right now."" ""I'm very excited about where I think he can go to, and we've had good conversations about the impact that he can make,"" Quinn said of Beasley, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft and the 2016 NFL sack champion. ""The biggest impact that he can make is doing it really consistently.""
Greg Robinson has re-signed with the Cleveland Browns, the team announced Monday. His agents had earlier announced a deal had been agreed upon. Terms were not disclosed. Robinson's career was hanging by a thread when the Browns signed the former No. 2 overall pick to a one-year deal shortly after the team's minicamp in June.

26273688,"The deal has been approved unanimously by the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum Stadium Authority board but still needs approval from the Oakland City Council and the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, which is considered a formality.
As part of the agreement, the Raiders will pay $7.5 million in rent for the upcoming season, and should the team's $1.9 billion, 65,000-seat domed stadium in Las Vegas not be ready in time, they have the option to pay $10.5 million to return in 2020. The Raiders expect to be in Southern Nevada by then, though.
The Coliseum Authority will also receive 100 percent of any money for naming rights after having split it 50-50 with the Raiders in the past. RingCentral had reportedly been in talks to name the Coliseum in January.
A potential snag to the agreement arose late in the process, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, with an issue over the Raiders' Alameda practice facility and team headquarters, which had been deeded to the team as part of the $200 million stadium renovation when the team returned from a 13-season run in Los Angeles in 1995.
""The Raiders were responsible for the estimated $525,000 in operating costs, taxes and debt payment on the facility,"" the Chronicle reported. ""The Raiders had wanted the Coliseum to take back the facility now and assume its costs. The Coliseum Authority wanted the Raiders to cover the facility costs until the end of the new lease.""
According to the Chronicle, the Raiders have to pay an owed $750,000 in parking fees.
Coliseum Authority executive director Scott McKibben told the Chronicle: ""It's been agreed that the property comes back to us when the Raiders leave town and stop playing football at the Coliseum.""
The Raiders, who had their rent tripled after losing a vote to move to Los Angeles in 2016, initially took their one-year, $7.5 million lease offer off the table in December after the city of Oakland filed a federal lawsuit against the Raiders and the NFL over the team's move to Las Vegas.
Raiders owner Mark Davis called the suit ""meritless and malicious"" at the time and said the team would keep all options open.
But after considering joining the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara and being blocked from playing in San Francisco at Oracle Park, the Giants' waterfront baseball park, all roads led back to Oakland and the Coliseum. The Raiders have called the Coliseum home from 1966 through 1981 and again since 1995. They played in 1960 and '61 at San Francisco's Kezar Stadium and Candlestick Park before moving to Frank Youell Field in Oakland in 1962. They played from 1982 to '94 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
The NFL had originally hoped to have an answer on the Raiders' home for 2019 by early February for scheduling purposes. The schedule is generally announced in mid-to-late April, before the draft.
The Raiders will share the Coliseum again with baseball's Athletics. Open Sundays in September for potential Raiders games on the baseball dirt infield are on the 15th (the A's play a night game on Sept. 16) and the 29th (the regular-season home finale for the A's is the 22nd), with open Mondays on Sept. 9 (when the A's begin a seven-game road trip) and Sept. 23.
The Raiders will again lose a home game to international play, as they will ""host"" Khalil Mack and the Chicago Bears in London. The team is also reportedly considering playing host to a preseason game at the home of the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders.
Davis told ESPN.com in October that he wanted to play in Oakland one last season, even with the threat of a lawsuit looming. ""Emotionally, I would say, why would I give them $3 [million], $4 [million], $5 million in rent that they're going to turn around and use to sue me?"" Davis said at the time. ""But at the same time, if they'll have us, I can't turn on the fans. I can't do it. And this is terrible negotiating I'm doing now. I'm going to get killed. But that's just the way I am. But if in fact it does get ugly and can't be bridged, we do have options.""
Raiders coach Jon Gruden made a point to celebrate the team's Christmas Eve win over the Denver Broncos last season with fans sitting in the Black Hole in the southern end zone. Raiders quarterback Derek Carr took a victory lap, slapping hands with fans. At the time, it was thought to be the last Raiders game at the Coliseum.
""It's a real football stadium -- it's dirt, grass, it has tradition,"" Gruden said the week of 2018 season finale. ""It's where some of the best games in the history of football have been played. It's where some of the best players in the history of the world played football games at. You're walking around before the Steeler game and you see Franco Harris and Lester Hayes and you think about some of the battles that they had at that place.
""There's a lot of things that happened in that stadium. Next question; I don't want to start crying about a stadium.""
Carr, meanwhile, said he ""loved"" Oakland and spoke of ""six dudes"" who jumped the barrier in an effort to join him on his lap, before being tackled by security. ""It is hard that it might be the last time, but if it is, it will always be there like, 'Man, what a time we have had there,'"" he said then.
Carr, who suffered a season-ending broken right ankle in 2016 at the Coliseum, added: ""We have had some tears of pain, joy and all those things ... we have the best fans in the world, the most loyal.
""They were on fire. It's not the professional football atmosphere where everyone is in a tie and doing their thing. It is football, it is a rough and gritty place.""
And the Raiders' home for one last ride.

26223048,"Happy legal tampering day!
As of Monday, NFL teams are legally allowed to start talking with the agents for prospective free-agent players -- that is, players whose contracts expire at 4 p.m. ET Wednesday when the new league year begins.
The next couple of days are where the first wave of free agency really happens, and by 4 p.m. ET Wednesday, we'll likely have a sense of where most of the big names are headed.

So, before it all gets started, I felt I'd share with you a little bit of what I'm hearing about how the week might play out:
Jump to:
Under-the-radar positions | Trade rumblings
Thrifty playoff teams | Don't be surprised if ...
Quick hitters | What about the QBs?

Sources familiar with the Raiders' thinking say they would like to use their salary-cap space on offensive players and find defensive solutions in a defense-heavy draft in which they hold four of the top 35 picks. Bell's market has been a bit tough to figure out. I've heard the Jets, Ravens and Texans listed as interested teams, but no one seems to know who's going to pay Bell $12-13 million a year or more. Jon Gruden and the Vegas-bound Raiders obviously aren't afraid to be aggressive.
Maybe one like the four-year, $30 million deal Jerick McKinnon got from the 49ers last year. There are teams looking for running backs who are telling people they're more interested in Coleman at his price than Bell at his. Look out for the Jets, Ravens and Texans if they don't get Le'Veon, and don't completely rule out the 49ers, who don't owe McKinnon another guaranteed penny.
The wide receiver market is a bit thin (except for one specific part of it we'll get to later), and there's a list of teams interested in finding out what the 6-foot-4 Williams would look like as their No. 1 wideout. Teams looking for receivers include the Colts, Jets, Browns and Bills, who happen to be the top four teams in terms of projected available cap space, as well as the Titans, 49ers, Cardinals, Lions, Eagles and Patriots. Williams is going to have a huge market.

The Chargers' release of Jahleel Addae caught my attention, as I'd been told to watch out for them as a surprise potential Thomas destination. They had some interest in Eric Weddle before he signed with the Rams, and while Thomas will cost a lot more than Weddle did, the Chargers could view him as the player who puts their stacked roster over the top. Of course, the Chiefs, who edged out the Chargers for the AFC West title in 2018, have a need at the position as well and were among the teams interested in trading for Thomas last fall.

The safety market is flooded, but Thomas is in a class by himself and could become the league's highest-paid player at the position this week.
Tyrell Williams, as we mentioned earlier, should benefit from the dearth of outside receivers in this market. But I'm hearing numbers in the $9-10 million-a-year range for slot guys like Adam Humphries, Jamison Crowder and Cole Beasley, all of whom could move on from their former teams for big deals elsewhere.
What could Earl Thomas' new contract look like? We projected free-agent deals, based on conversations with people in the league.
Vontaze Burfict is headed to Oakland as a veteran stopgap. Did the Raiders actually improve? Bill Barnwell evaluates the biggest deals.
The NFL free-agency period is here. We rank the top 100 players to hit the open market, from Le'Veon Bell to depth defenders.
C.J. Mosley and Anthony Barr are big names whose teams didn't franchise them because the linebacker franchise number ($15.443 million) was too big. The number is inflated because pass-rushing 3-4 outside linebackers are lumped together with linebackers like Mosley and Barr, who don't rush the passer. Neither Mosley nor Barr can expect to make $15 million per year on a new deal, but it's not crazy to think they could each get Luke Kuechly-level $12 million-a-year deals if enough teams are interested.
The Rams will look different on the offensive line, where center John Sullivan is a free agent and so is left guard Rodger Saffold. The latter is almost surely gone from L.A. and is the top guard on a relatively thin market. Two veteran guards -- Kevin Zeitler and Kelechi Osemele -- have been traded in the past few days. More teams are looking.
Not sure if you noticed, but the Patriots didn't franchise anyone, including kicker Stephen Gostkowski. Many expect them to re-sign him, but would another team (Bears?) swoop in and give Gostkowski a top-of-the-market deal based on his career accomplishments? And if so, do we have to wonder what the Patriots know? They've had only two different kickers since 1996. If they're making a change at the position, there must be a good reason.
It's reportedly for $13 million per year (though we haven't seen the full details yet, possibly because the Eagles are waiting until the new league year to officially execute it for accounting purposes), and several teams at the combine were disappointed with the Eagles for paying that high a price for a soon-to-be-31-year-old pass-rusher. The deal allowed the Eagles to trade Michael Bennett to the Patriots, and it likely drives up the price for free-agent pass-rushers such as Za'Darius Smith. Graham has the same agent as Justin Houston, a similar-age pass-rusher who was cut by the Chiefs on Sunday and is free to sign with any team immediately.

Again, we have yet to see the full details, but ESPN's Adam Schefter is reporting Brown will earn $19.8 million per year in new money on the contract the Raiders will give him once his trade from Pittsburgh to Oakland becomes official. Obviously, Tyrell Williams can't hope for a number like that, but it doesn't make life easier for the Falcons, Saints and Chiefs, who are working on extensions for Julio Jones, Michael Thomas and Tyreek Hill, respectively. The first $20 million-a-year wide receiver contract could arrive this summer.
The Cowboys are so focused on extensions for Dak Prescott, DeMarcus Lawrence, Amari Cooper, Byron Jones and (eventually) Ezekiel Elliott that they aren't expected to be major players in free agency. Some people have connected them with Earl Thomas for a long time, but his price is likely going to be too high for the Cowboys, who might wait out this deep safety market and find a bargain.

If the Bears lose safety Adrian Amos and slot corner Bryce Callahan, they'll have to fill those spots. But Chicago's big offseason was last year, and the Bears like the roster they have. Watch out to see what they do at running back, where Jordan Howard could be cut and Adrian Peterson could be a free-agent target to replace him.
Like the Cowboys, Seattle is focused internally. Starting guards J.R. Sweezy and D.J. Fluker are both free agents, and if they leave the Hawks will have to find some other guys with initials instead of first names to play guard. Linebacker K.J. Wright (what's with the initials?) is another free agent they'd like to keep, and they are preparing for extension talks with defensive end Frank Clark, linebacker Bobby Wagner, defensive tackle Jarran Reed and the big one: quarterback Russell Wilson.
Multiple sources expect former Patriots defensive end Trey Flowers to get a monster deal (maybe in excess of $18 million per year) on the open market after many of the top free-agent pass-rushers got franchised. Two of Flowers' former New England defensive coordinators are now head coaches: Brian Flores in Miami and Matt Patricia in Detroit. Watch Flowers for the Lions, who are expected to be among the most aggressive players on this market.
Landon Collins was a first-team All-Pro safety in 2016 when he was with the Giants and Steve Spagnuolo was his defensive coordinator. Spagnuolo is now the defensive coordinator in Kansas City. Collins might not be a perfect fit for the Chiefs, whose top choice would be a free safety. And a team like the Colts, who already have Malik Hooker for the back end, might make more sense for Collins. But if anyone knows how Collins can help a defense, it's Spagnuolo.
Giants fans might want the team to reunite safety Tyrann Mathieu with former Arizona defensive coordinator James Bettcher in East Rutherford, New Jersey, but the more likely former-Cardinal Giants target is free-agent linebacker Deone Bucannon.

At last check, the Giants still had no active trade talks involving their star wide receiver. And I still seriously doubt ownership signs off on a trade that would leave the Giants with $16 million in dead money on their cap and having paid Beckham $21.5 million in cash for 12 games. But there are teams (specifically the 49ers and Browns) still hoping to talk the Giants out of Beckham, and there are still people around the league who believe such a move isn't impossible for the right (exorbitant) price. This isn't an Antonio Brown situation, where the team feels it has to dump a guy for whatever it can get.

It's hard to imagine the Buccaneers' defense without McCoy, but the Bucs really could use the $13 million in cap savings they'd get by trading him. Watch Tampa Bay's other moves in the coming days (cut or trade DeSean Jackson, for example?) and see whether they end up needing the cap room and getting what they need to get in exchange for a well-liked star.
Houston has been trying to re-sign Tyrann Mathieu, but so far it hasn't tried hard enough. He still could end up back there, but more than one source has told me to watch out for Baltimore.
Nick Foles is still expected to sign a multiyear deal with the Jaguars, but there's some tough negotiating still to do. Jacksonville is more or less the only place Foles can go and start, and Foles is the top quarterback option for the Jags. It would be a shock if this didn't get done, but since neither side has much leverage, there could still be a hiccup or two before the final details are nailed down.
Even coming off a November ACL tear, 25-year-old cornerback Ronald Darby is of interest to several teams. Don't be surprised if he gets a big deal.
The Saints are still hoping to bring back running back Mark Ingram, but not for much (if any) more than the $4 million or so per year he was making with them on his most recent deal. He'll check out the market, but he's got it pretty good in New Orleans.

Unless the Nick Foles deal totally collapses in Jacksonville or Miami signs him to be a starter, Bridgewater's best play might end up being a return to New Orleans for another season as Drew Brees' backup.
Expected to be cut by the Dolphins, Tannehill could surface as Sam Darnold's backup with the Jets, where new coach Adam Gase has always been a fan.
The obvious fits are Baltimore and Carolina, where the starters are mobile, and the offenses are somewhat designed around that, which is one of Taylor's strengths.

26236785,"Linebacker C.J. Mosley is expected to sign a five-year, $85 million deal with the New York Jets that has $51 million guaranteed, sources confirmed to ESPN.
NFL Network first reported the deal.
In a span of several hours overnight, the Jets reshaped their linebacker corps for new defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, adding Mosley and Anthony Barr, who have eight Pro Bowl appearances between them. The total cost will be approximately $32 million per year.
The Jets envision Mosley, 26, as an inside linebacker in their 3-4 scheme and the leader of the front seven. They now have five starting-caliber linebackers, with Mosley, Avery Williamson and Darron Lee inside and Barr and Jordan Jenkins outside. Williamson's $6 million salary is fully guaranteed, so he likely will remain as Mosley's inside partner.
The Jets have landed former Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr, who intends to sign with New York when the free-agency period opens, a league source said.
Mosley was the leading tackler for the NFL's top-ranked defense and was the Baltimore Ravens' most high-profile free agent this offseason. He is one of two players, along with Carolina's Luke Kuechly, to record at least 500 tackles, eight sacks and eight interceptions since 2014.
A first-round pick (17th overall) in 2014, Mosley has gone to the Pro Bowl in four of his five NFL seasons, which puts him in select company. Seven of the 11 linebackers who were named to Pro Bowls at least four times in five seasons are in the Hall of Fame. Last year, Hall of Famer Ray Lewis called Mosley the best middle linebacker in the game.
This marks the first time in the Ravens' 23-year history that they have failed to keep a multiple Pro Bowl first-round pick past his rookie deal. Offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden, Lewis, outside linebacker Peter Boulware, cornerback Chris McAlister, tight end Todd Heap, safety Ed Reed, outside linebacker Terrell Suggs and defensive tackle Haloti Ngata all signed second contracts with Baltimore.
In a span of a week, the NFL's top-ranked defense has now lost its two signal-callers, Mosley and safety Eric Weddle; its most tenured player, Suggs; and linebacker Za'Darius Smith. Mosley, Weddle and Suggs have combined for 460 NFL starts and 17 Pro Bowls.

The biggest knock on Mosley has been his pass coverage, but his interception of Baker Mayfield in the final regular-season game clinched Baltimore's first playoff berth in four years. Mosley also posted career lows in passing yards allowed (408), yards per reception (9.3) and yards after the catch (190), according to Pro Football Focus.
The Ravens and Mosley both expressed optimism he would remain with the team. Baltimore, however, chose not to use a $15 million franchise tag, allowing Mosley to become a free agent.
With Mosley gone, the Ravens could replace him with Kenny Young, a fourth-round pick from a year ago, or a veteran free agent.
Mosley's 574 career tackles rank fifth in Ravens history.
Lee, a former first-round pick, faces an uncertain future. He hasn't met expectations over three years and finished last season with a four-game, substance abuse suspension. He counts only $3.3 million on the cap in the final year of his rookie contract, so he could be traded or released. His $1.8 million salary no longer is guaranteed because the guarantee was voided by the suspension.
One source cautioned that Lee could remain on the Jets roster in a backup role, with Williams finding creative ways to use him.

26236672,"""I'm excited about it,"" Bennett said Monday during an appearance at Princeton University's Richardson Auditorium.
Bennett, who was scheduled to take a physical with the Patriots in Boston on Tuesday, said he looked forward to being coached by Bill Belichick and playing on a team led by Tom Brady.
""From a football perspective there's a respect for Belichick,"" Bennett said. ""I consider him the Yoda of football when it comes to the ins and outs of what's happening around how to prepare for a game.""
Defensive end Michael Bennett told ESPN the Eagles have informed him that they are planning to trade him to the Patriots. His brother, tight end Martellus Bennett, is contemplating coming out of retirement, a source said.
As for leaving the Eagles after a season and joining what many fans consider the NFL's Evil Empire, Bennett said he embraces the change.
""The Patriots are a team that people love to hate because they always win,"" he said. ""The opportunity to learn from that and be in that environment is good.""
Bennett said the trade to New England initially surprised him. He was one of a core of NFL players who followed Colin Kaepernick's lead beginning in 2016 and protested during the playing of the national anthem.
The protest agitated many fans and drew the ire of President Donald Trump, who condemned the protesting players and suggested they should be fired.
Belichick and Brady are enthusiastic supporters of the president. In meetings with Patriots executives, Bennett said he would continue to remain in the locker room during the playing of the anthem.
""I explained to them that my integrity means everything,"" Bennett said. ""I think they respect that about me, they respect who I am as an individual.""
He added: ""The Patriots have been trying to trade for me for two years. Last year they tried to get me, the year before they tried to get me.""
Now they have him.
Bennett would neither deny nor confirm that his younger brother, Martellus, would also join the Patriots. ""I'd love to play with my brother but I don't want to be the force that forces my brother to play because I'm playing on the team,"" he said. ""I want him to play purely because he wants to play.

""The game is played a lot better when you truly want to play because you want to play. It's important, if he decides to come back, that's the first thing he should think about. As a brother that's my ultimate goal to see him happy, and whatever happiness looks for him, that's what I wanted.""
He said he was looking forward to engaging Belichick and Brady about their support of a president who is largely viewed to be hostile to the interests of people of color.
""I think it's important not to to run away from those conversations, or not hear their ideas about why they think the way they do,"" he said.
""I think it's an opportunity for growth to have those conversations,"" he added. ""If we don't allow ourselves to have those conversations, we're stunting our growth.""
Bennett was a major defensive contributor to the Seattle Seahawks' Super Bowl championship in 2013. Last March, he was traded to the Eagles. ""I'm the same person, it's just that my voice is being heard more,"" Bennett said.
Bennett is the author of ""Things That Make White People Uncomfortable."" How will the Patriots fan base respond to what Bennett does on the field and says away from it?
""Those conversations will present themselves,"" Bennett said. ""I think it's going to be really unique.""

26258258,"The 5-foot-10, 192-pound Dorsett was a valuable backup for the Patriots since he was acquired in a 2017 trade from the Indianapolis Colts in exchange for quarterback Jacoby Brissett.
He played in 31 regular-season games (four starts) since the trade, totaling 44 catches for 484 yards and three touchdowns. He played in five playoff games, with seven catches for 120 yards and two touchdowns.

The Patriots relied on Dorsett more early in the 2018 season, when Julian Edelman was serving a four-game NFL suspension. Once Edelman returned and receiver Josh Gordon was acquired in a mid-September trade and eased into the team's system, Dorsett's playing time diminished.
Still, he showed a knack for catching most everything thrown in his direction and rising up in critical situations.
Dorsett joins four other Patriots receivers under contract for 2019: Edelman, Braxton Berrios, Damoun Patterson and Matthew Slater.
Dorsett told ESPN earlier this year that his goal is to be a starter, but he left open a return to New England.
""Me and him have a good relationship,"" he said of coach Bill Belichick. ""I believe he wants me back. I do believe that. At the end of the day, you really never know. I'm going in [to free agency] with blinders. I don't really know what's going to happen.
""Obviously, I want to win. I don't want to play this game just to play it. I play because I love it and the relationships. The whole organization was just amazing. Obviously, everyone has their personal goals, and I do want to be a bigger role. That's just the kind of guy I am. And helping the team win.""
Dorsett, who turned 26 in January, entered the NFL as a first-round draft choice (No. 29 overall) of the Colts in 2015. He has 95 receptions for 1,237 yards and six touchdowns in 57 games.
NFL Network first reported the agreement.

26260622,"Antonio Brown said the opportunity to play for Raiders coach Jon Gruden was a factor in his decision to work out a trade to Oakland. Brown said he aims to hold his teammates to a high standard and a personal goal is to pass Jerry Rice's receptions record.
The team announced the contract on Thursday.
Moncrief signed a one-year contract worth a guaranteed $9.6 million with the Jaguars last March. In 16 games, he caught 48 passes for 668 yards, which were his highest totals since he caught 64 passes for 733 yards in his second season in 2015 -- the last time he played in all 16 games.
Moncrief spent his first four seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, who drafted him in the third round (90th overall) in 2014. Moncrief caught 152 passes for 1,875 yards and 18 touchdowns with the Colts. However, he missed seven games in 2016 and four games in 2017 because of injuries and struggled to make much of an impact despite playing opposite T.Y. Hilton.
The Colts did not offer him a second contract, and the Jaguars signed him as a replacement for Allen Robinson, after Robinson opted to sign with the Chicago Bears last year.

26242795,"The Patriots had acquired Patterson and a 2018 sixth-round pick from the Oakland Raiders in exchange for a 2018 fifth-round pick in March 2018. The deal was sparked, in part, by Patterson's $3 million base salary and $250,000 workout bonus, which the Raiders deemed too high for a player whose primary contributions came as a kickoff returner.
But the salary was deemed tenable by Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who places a high priority on special teams.

As it turned out, Patterson helped the Patriots in multiple spots over the course of the 2018 season as a ""slash""-type option. At one point, he took handoffs as a traditional running back when the team had a run of injuries at the position.
In 15 regular-season games, with five starts, Patterson totaled 42 rushing attempts for 228 yards, with one touchdown. He added 21 receptions for 247 yards and three touchdowns. As for kickoff returns, he had 23 for 663 yards (28.8 avg.) and one touchdown, which came against the Bears.
The 6-foot-2, 228-pound Patterson, who turns 28 on March 17, entered the NFL as a first-round draft choice (29th overall) of the Minnesota Vikings in 2013. He spent four years in Minnesota before signing with the Raiders as a free agent before the 2017 season.

26179114,"Suspended Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle David Irving said Thursday that he is quitting the NFL.
Irving, 25, made the announcement as he filmed himself in a video on Instagram Live, less than a week after the league suspended him indefinitely for violating its substance-abuse policy for a third time in as many years.
""Basically, guys, I quit,"" Irving said. ""I don't want to talk about a suspension and all this other nonsense. I'm outta there. I'm not doing this s--- no more.""
Cowboys DT David Irving, who is about to become a free agent, was suspended indefinitely for his third violation of the substance abuse and personal conduct policies in three seasons.
Of the 123 major sports teams, 82 percent play in areas where it's legal to purchase medicinal or recreational marijuana. The NHL has noticed. Who's next?
Irving specified that his problem is with the league, rather than the sport.
""Everyone questions my commitment to football, but let's get it straight, here and now,"" he said. ""I love football. ... I wouldn't be here without it. Don't get me wrong, I love football. However, I don't love the NFL. The NFL is not football, you need to understand that. What you all see us do, the game and s---, that's, what, 20 percent of all the real s--- we're doing.""
Irving appeared to be smoking marijuana during the video and spoke about how he disagreed with the NFL's policy on the substance.
• Offseason testing: Players with no previous violations are tested once.
• Regular-season testing: 10 players per team are randomly selected each week.
• Positive tests: A positive test results in a referral to the substance abuse program. A second violation results in a fine of two game checks. A third violation is four game checks. A fourth violation is a four-game suspension. A fifth violation is a 10-game suspension. A sixth violation results in a one-year banishment.
""It's funny, you know, some people: 'Oh, you're addicted to weed, you're addicted to this and that,'"" he said. ""I mean, s---, if I'm gonna be addicted to something, I'd rather be addicted to marijuana, which is medical -- it's a medicine; I do not consider it a drug -- rather than Xanax bars or the hydros or the seroquel and all that crazy s--- that they feed you.
""Like I said, it's not about smoking weed. How many NBA players you see getting in trouble about this? How many coaches you see getting in trouble about this? How many baseball players? How many UFC players getting in trouble?""
Irving will be a free agent when the league year begins next week, and the Cowboys have not expressed a desire to bring him back.
""I don't think I'm a bad guy for choosing this route. I stand up for what I believe in,"" he said. ""It is bulls---. I'll 'Kaepernick' myself before they 'Kaepernick' my ass.""

26227336,"Former Miami Dolphins wide receiver Danny Amendola has signed with the Detroit Lions, the team announced Monday.
A source told ESPN's Dianna Russini that the deal is for one year, $4.5 million and could be worth up to $5.75 million.
The Lions need a slot receiver after trading Golden Tate to the Philadelphia Eagles at the trade deadline last year. Amendola has 391 catches when lined up in the slot since his first full season in the NFL in 2009, the second-most in the NFL in that time behind Wes Welker, according to ESPN Stats & Information.
In their search for a replacement for Tate, the Lions had gone through Bruce Ellington, TJ Jones and Brandon Powell. Of the three, only Powell, an undrafted free agent from Florida last year, is signed by the Lions for 2019.
The signing also reunites Amendola with Lions general manager Bob Quinn and coach Matt Patricia from their time with the New England Patriots.
The Lions are going to be looking for a new starting cornerback as the club is releasing Nevin Lawson days before the start of the new league year, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
We're keeping track of every notable signing, trade and cut throughout the month, with analysis from our experts.
Amendola, 33, continued to show his toughness and knack for finding open zones out of the slot with the Dolphins, leading the team in receiving last season with 575 yards on 59 catches.
He was released Friday, as the Dolphins didn't see him as a long-term fit at his price for a team that is in rebuilding mode, although they did like the leadership that he brought to the locker room in his only season in Miami. The Dolphins saved $6 million in salary-cap space by releasing Amendola, who signed a two-year deal last March for $12 million.
An 11-year veteran, Amendola has had a nice career after starting as an undrafted free agent out of Texas Tech in 2008. He has caught 485 passes for 4,684 yards and 20 touchdowns while also playing for the Rams and Patriots, with whom he won two Super Bowl rings but left for a bigger payday after taking pay cuts in each of his final three seasons with the team.
Amendola's time in New England, from 2013 to 2017, overlapped with Patricia's time as defensive coordinator and part of Quinn's time with the club.
Amendola, who started more than eight games for the first time in his career last season, has played 16 games in a season just twice (2010, '14).

26275527,"On Friday, Rath's attorney, Vicki Podberesky, entered a plea of not guilty on Rath's behalf at Ventura County Superior Court.
Rath, 35, was arrested Jan. 15 on suspicion of sexual battery, stemming from an incident in Moorpark, California (approximately 10 miles from the team's practice headquarters), on June 15, 2018, according to a press release from the Ventura County District Attorney's office.
The Rams placed Rath on leave following his arrest. Rath did not coach in the NFC Championship Game in New Orleans or in Super Bowl LIII against the New England Patriots in Atlanta.
""We are aware of the charges filed against Ted Rath,"" the Rams said in a statement Friday. ""We take these allegations very seriously. Once the charges were filed, we decided Ted would take a leave of absence from the team as this matter works its way through the justice system.""
During the week of the Super Bowl in February, NFL.com reported that Rath would not be in attendance because of a medical procedure. Rath had recently risen to moderate fame because of a viral video that promoted his role as Rams coach Sean McVay's ""get-back coach,"" tasked with keeping McVay from entering the playing field during games. ""We love him,"" McVay told NFL.com days before the Super Bowl. ""I know the players and coaches miss him when he's not here with us, but he's with us in spirit. He's done a great job of helping us get to this point and he knows that.""
On Friday, a Rams spokesperson confirmed that Rath underwent a medical procedure during his leave.
According to the press release from the district attorney's office, the charges allege that Rath ""touched an adult woman against her will on intimate parts of her body for the purpose of sexual arousal and gratification"" at a private residence in Moorpark.
Podberesky issued the following statement on behalf of her client: ""Mr. Rath takes these allegations very seriously. Ted is a man who has led a law-abiding life. He is a husband, a father and a dedicated family man. He has the utmost respect for women and would never intentionally act in a manner that was demeaning or otherwise inappropriate. We intend to defend this matter to the fullest extent possible in a court of law, and we believe that after there has been a full vetting of the facts of this case Mr. Rath will be shown to be not guilty of these charges.""
If convicted on all three counts, Rath could face a maximum sentence of 18 months in jail and would be required to register as a sex offender.
Rath has coached for 10 seasons in the NFL. He joined the Rams as their director of strength and performance last season following stints with the Miami Dolphins and Detroit Lions.

26264551,"PITTSBURGH -- Antonio Brown didn't want to leave Pittsburgh without saying goodbye.
Brown purchased electronic billboard spots in downtown Pittsburgh with the message ""Thank You Pittsburgh, AB 84"" with Brown's signature and a picture of the All-Pro receiver.
Antonio Brown said the opportunity to play for Raiders coach Jon Gruden was a factor in his decision to work out a trade to Oakland. Brown said he aims to hold his teammates to a high standard and a personal goal is to pass Jerry Rice's receptions record.
Brown was traded to the Oakland Raiders after nine seasons with the Steelers. The matching billboards on the corner of Boulevard of the Allies and Grant Street were ordered by Brown himself and posted Thursday.
Brown's introductory news conference in Oakland on Wednesday ended a bizarre two-plus months between Brown and the Steelers, who received a third- and a fifth-round pick in exchange for Brown. Brown frustrated the organization by skipping work in Week 17, which sparked the team's interest in trading him.
But Brown requested a trade in late January and later disparaged the organization on social media and in an interview with ESPN's Jeff Darlington. His bizarre behavior on social media coupled with his demand for a new contract made trading him for significant draft capital difficult.
But Brown used his Oakland news conference to express gratitude for his time in Pittsburgh.
""To any kid out there from Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh will always be my family,"" Brown said. ""Those guys gave me a chance when I was a 21-year-old kid. Obviously, people are listening to the things that are being said and written. At the end of the day, it's all about how you make people feel. I think I made people feel good and great, really inspired, the way they watched me work, the way they watched me play. I know Steeler Nation is having a bad day today, but it's always love. I encourage every kid who watched me work and was inspired by everything I've done. I hope I continue to be a good example, continue to be a good role model and continue to inspire people.""
Brown recorded an NFL-record six consecutive 100-catch seasons with the Steelers.

26144310,"Bynes, 29, started 11 games for the Cardinals last season before a thumb injury ended his season. He finished with 75 tackles and a career-high two sacks.
The Cardinals will save $1.775 million on their salary cap with the move. He was scheduled to be paid a base salary of $1.5 million in 2019.
Bynes spent his first three seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, who signed him as an undrafted free agent in 2011. He was on the Super Bowl championship team of 2012, and had one tackle in the title game -- on Ted Ginn Jr. after a free kick -- in the final seconds of the game to clinch the Ravens' 34-31 victory over the San Francisco 49ers.
He was signed by the Detroit Lions off the Ravens practice squad on 2014 and played for the Lions for three seasons.
He was signed by the Cardinals to a one-year contract at the league's veteran minimum in 2017, and in March 2018, the Cardinals signed him to a three-year, $5.57 million contract that included $1.25 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $1 million.

26266176,"To do that, though, he had to pay the Eagles $2 million to buy out the final year of his contract so he could become a free agent. That's a significant chunk of money to spend at once, even for a professional athlete, but Foles never hesitated.
""When you look at the monetary value, absolutely, yes, that is a lot of money, for my family and for the different things we can do in the community, but at the same time it was a no-brainer,"" Foles said. ""It was the best $2 million investment I could ever do.""
He got a pretty good return on his money. That $2 million turned into a guaranteed $50.125 million on Thursday when he signed a four-year contract worth $88 million to become the starting quarterback of the Jacksonville Jaguars. It's a job he's wanted since a disappointing 2015 season in St. Louis caused him to lose his zeal for the game.
""It was nothing against Philly. I love Philadelphia,"" Foles said. ""They know how much I love them and I always will love Philadelphia no matter what, just like I love the University of Arizona, just like I love Westlake High School [in Texas], but life changes, things move on, you go to a different part of your life. But to be a free agent, to have an opportunity to ultimately go into a locker room and help lead a team and help change the environment is what intrigued me.
""That's why it was paid back so quickly. It had nothing to do with, 'I want out of here.' It's just my time. I've ran my race in Philadelphia. I did everything I could and I'm proud of that. I've been around amazing people but I look forward to going somewhere else and helping another team and ultimately I hope it's my last.""
So do the Jaguars, who have been searching for a franchise quarterback since Mark Brunell led them to a pair of AFC Championship Game appearances in the team's first five years of existence. The Jaguars tried Byron Leftwich, David Garrard, Blaine Gabbert and, most recently, Blake Bortles, but none has been the answer, though Garrard and Bortles had some success in the playoffs.
Foles is here now because of what he did in the postseason, taking over for an injured Carson Wentz and leading the Eagles to a Super Bowl LII championship after the 2017 season. He out-dueled Tom Brady and was the game's MVP. Foles was forced into the same role again last season and nearly led the Eagles to a comeback victory over New Orleans in a divisional game.
One of the most important things Foles brings to the Jaguars is consistency. One of Bortles' biggest problems -- after turnovers -- was the fact that the Jaguars were never quite sure what they were going to get each week.
""I like it that you know what you're getting,"" coach Doug Marrone said. ""The consistency, nothing really rattles him. I think that's what I've taken [from his research on Foles]. You talk to coaches that have been around him and they say nothing ever really rattles him. He takes information. He's smart. He knows where he wants to go with the ball. He knows coverages. Those things were the things that jumped off to me outside of what you can see on the tape and playing on the big stage.""
The Jaguars gave Foles a $25 million signing bonus and his cap number in 2019 will be $12 million (it jumps to $21 million in 2020) roughly 13 months after they signed Bortles to a three-year contract extension. That deal included $16.5 million in dead money if the Jaguars were to release Bortles this year, which they did on Wednesday.
That means the Jaguars have a $28.5 million combined cap figure with Foles and Bortles. That would rank third behind Matthew Stafford ($29.5 million) and Kirk Cousins ($29 million) in terms of quarterback cap hits, yet executive vice president of football operations Tom Coughlin said he doesn't regret signing Bortles to the extension.
""It was the right thing to do,"" Coughlin said Thursday in his first media opportunity since the 2018 draft. ""The guy took us to the AFC Championship Game. There wouldn't have been anybody that would have disputed the fact that he deserved the opportunity and we played well behind and our defense played well. So what we did at that point in time is try to fortify our team around him. Obviously, we wish it was better but I have no regrets about that.""
And he certainly doesn't have any about giving Foles the most guaranteed money in franchise history, either. Especially if Foles can turn in the kind of performance he did in an early-November game five seasons ago.
""I do have one request of Nick,"" Coughlin said. ""I hope every game in 2019 is like the Oakland game of 2013, where he threw seven touchdowns, no interceptions, and had a perfect 158.3 quarterback rating.""

26030855,"PITTSBURGH -- The Antonio Brown trade saga is getting much-needed clarity after the All-Pro receiver met with Pittsburgh Steelers president Art Rooney II on Tuesday.
Brown tweeted that both sides ""agreed that it is time to move on.""
Had a great meeting with Mr.Rooney today we discussed a lot of things and we cleared the air on several issues! We both agreed  that it is time to move on but I'll always have appreciation and gratitude towards the  Rooney family and @steelers organization! #CallGod #Boomin pic.twitter.com/DEgURchvhW
Brown's agent Drew Rosenhaus joined the meeting, as did Steelers GM Kevin Colbert and executive Omar Khan, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The meeting was cordial and ""everyone agreed the trade will be for the best,"" a source told Schefter.
Rooney told reporters last month that he wanted to hear directly from Brown on what went wrong.
Brown, who first requested a trade in late January, tweeted it was a ""great meeting"" and that he and Rooney ""cleared the air on several issues.""
Steelers All-Pro wide receiver Antonio Brown took questions from fans on Twitter on Saturday, addressing his recent trade request and his relationship with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.
Rosenhaus told ESPN's NFL Live that he doesn't have permission to talk to other teams or work on a trade and that the ""whole trade effort"" is being run by the Steelers.
""They have the ability to talk to other teams right now and find the best deal for them,"" Rosenhaus told ESPN. ""We hope they get a great amount of compensation. We want everybody to win here. it would be great for the Steelers to get what they deem fair compensation for Antonio, and for Antonio to find a new team at this point. And we reap all the positives from that. So that is where it is.""
The tweet followed an Instagram video posted by Brown, who said he's not playing without more guaranteed money and reinforced his desire to be traded by the Steelers.
""If your squad out there want to win and your squad want a hungry wide receiver who's the best in the whole world, someone hit my phone,"" Brown said into his phone camera while working on an elliptical. ""Tell them I ain't doing no unguarantees. I ain't even gonna play myself no more for this NFL, you heard.""
Brown has no more true guarantees left on his current deal. The five-year, $72.7 million extension he signed in 2017 includes base salaries of $12.625 million, $11.3 million and $12.5 million. Those relatively modest numbers are considered a selling point in a trade. Brown is due a $2.5 million roster bonus on March 17, but the Steelers could avoid payment by trading or releasing him before that date.
NFL contracts can be reworked, so Brown can ask a new team to convert salaried money into guarantees -- a strategy the Steelers used twice with Brown in the past, converting future money into a signing bonus. But teams hold the power since he's under contract. Brown's only true leverage is threatening to hold out.
Rosenhaus told ESPN that ""Antonio was clear about what he's looking for"" and this is ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for another football team.""
Brown turns 31 in July, and the Steelers are making receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster a focal point of the offense. The team would take on $21.12 million in dead money by releasing or trading Brown but would offset that money by saving on his $22.165 million salary-cap figure for 2019.
Brown, who said he'd like to be known as ""Mr. Big Chest"" from now on, remains unfazed.
""I think I done done everything. What y'all think? What's left for me to do?"" Brown said. ""Win a Super Bowl? Hey, gotta be the right team for that, right? Who wants smoke? I've got a lot of fuel built up. When this fuel turns to smoke, hope you're in shape, hope you're ready to go the distance. I'm telling you, I'm ready to go 36 rounds, like a heavyweight, ya heard. ...
""If your team got guaranteed money, tell them call me. AB can't do no more unguarantees. So we clear. I want ya'll to be clear and understand something. This is not a game, people. This is not for show; this is not to be cool. This is strictly to inspire you that no one can determine your destination but you.""
Sources have maintained that the Steelers will be patient with any deal and will want a high draft pick in return for Brown, who holds an NFL-record six consecutive 100-catch seasons.
Brown has been doing his best to put public pressure on the Steelers, thanking fans for nine years with the team and fielding questions on Twitter. In a question-and-answer session Saturday, Brown said Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has an ""owner mentality"" for calling out players and coaches without repercussion and that coach Mike Tomlin told the team that Brown quit in Week 17 while he was hurt.

26144507,"Barron, who had two seasons remaining on his contract, was sidelined four games to start the 2018 season because of a nagging ankle injury. He finished with 43 tackles, a sack and a forced fumble.
The Rams save $6.33 million on their salary cap with the move and will carry a dead-money charge of $3.33 million. If they designate Barron for a post-June 1 release, they will save $8 million on their salary cap.
The Rams declined to exercise the 2019 option on starting center John Sullivan's contract, making him a free agent, sources told ESPN's Lindsey Thiry.
The Rams don't have a solid pass-rushing solution opposite Samson Ebukam and will look hard at re-signing Dante Fowler.
Barron, 29, was scheduled to be paid a base salary of $5 million in 2019.
The news of Barron's release follows the Rams' decision to decline the option on center John Sullivan's two-year contract, which saves the team $5.5 million on the salary cap.
But Barron's release leaves a notable hole in their linebacking corps as they attempt to build a roster worthy of a return trip to the Super Bowl.
Cory Littleton, who led the team with 90 tackles while adding four sacks and three interceptions, is expected to return. But backups Ramik Wilson, who started four games last season in Barron's absence, and Bryce Hager are unrestricted free agents. Micah Kiser, a fifth-round pick from Virginia in 2018, played a significant role on special teams, but he had only four tackles on defense.
The Rams acquired Barron midway through the 2014 season from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who selected him with the seventh overall pick in the 2012 draft.
A seven-year veteran, Barron has 628 career tackles, 9 sacks, 6 forced fumbles, 3 fumble recoveries and 8 interceptions.
The Rams moved Barron from safety to linebacker during the 2015 season and he finished with 113 tackles, 5 pass deflections and 3 forced fumbles.
Following that season, the Rams awarded him with a five-year deal worth up to $45 million.
Barron finished 2016 ranked second on the team with 118 tackles, two interceptions and a sack as the Rams stumbled to a 4-12 finish.
Over the last two seasons, Barron has been slowed because of various injuries but also played an instrumental role in helping the team win back-to-back division titles and earn its first Super Bowl appearance since the 2001 season.
In 2017, Barron dealt with a host of nagging injuries and was ultimately sidelined for the final three games of the regular season with a sore Achilles before he returned for a playoff loss in the wild-card round.
Last season, Barron was slowed and sidelined throughout training camp and sat out the first four games of the season because of a sore ankle. His 43 tackles were the fewest of his career.

26149941,"Teams that have spoken to the Pittsburgh Steelers about a potential Antonio Brown trade have been told that a deal is expected to be in place by Friday, league sources tell ESPN.
Any trade that is agreed upon can't be officially announced until next Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET, when the 2019 league year begins. It is likely Brown will want a restructured contract from any team that acquires him. Brown has three years remaining on his deal, with scheduled base salaries of $12.625 million in 2019, $11.3 million in 2020 and $12.5 million in 2021, but he has no guaranteed money remaining on the contract.
What are the pros and cons of adding the talented wide receiver? Which is the best landing spot? Our NFL Nation reporters weigh in.
Although other teams could emerge, the belief right now is that the Raiders, Redskins and Titans are the most likely landing spots for receiver Antonio Brown, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Steelers WR Antonio Brown said he believes he will be dealt by the team because that's ""what's good for their business,"" but he does not ""take any blame"" for the breakdown of his relationship with the franchise.
As of last Friday, the three teams that have shown the most interest in the wide receiver were the Oakland Raiders, Washington Redskins and Tennessee Titans. In addition, a couple more teams have jumped into the fray in the past 24 to 48 hours, sources said, putting the total number of teams to which the Steelers have spoken in the past few days at six or seven.
The Steelers' asking price started as a first-round pick and other compensation but has been reduced to a first-round pick, sources have told ESPN.
Brown has officially been on the trading block since he met with Steelers brass last month.
In an interview with ESPN last week, the star wide receiver said he is not ""angry"" with the team but maintained his desire to be traded.
Antonio Brown discusses his issues with Ben Roethlisberger, Mike Tomlin and Art Rooney II that led to his trade request from the Steelers.
Speaking at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis last week, Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert said the team hasn't ruled out any partners in a potential trade.
""Ideally, you want to trade him to somebody that you'll never play,"" Colbert said. ""But you can't do that. If you're good enough to get to the Super Bowl, you have to play him anyway.""
Brown, who turns 31 in July, owns an NFL-record six consecutive 100-catch seasons, but he frustrated the organization when he failed to show up for a workday in Week 17 and was benched for the season finale.
