25908742,"Four defensive backs -- Ed Reed, Champ Bailey, Ty Law and seniors finalist Johnny Robinson -- were among the eight men selected for enshrinement by the Hall's board of selectors on Saturday at the Georgia World Congress Center.
Youth served again as three first-time-eligible players -- Champ Bailey, Tony Gonzalez, Ed Reed -- dominate group along with Kevin Mawae and Ty Law.
Tom Flores coached two Super Bowls with the Raiders, becoming the first minority head coach to earn the Lombardi Trophy.
For eight seasons, Kevin Mawae cleared the path toward immortality for Curtis Martin with the Jets. This week, Martin is trying to return the favor.
Tight end Tony Gonzalez and center Kevin Mawae as well as Broncos owner Pat Bowlen and longtime personnel executive Gil Brandt were also chosen Saturday for enshrinement.
Members of Bowlen's family, on hearing of his selection, video chatted with Bowlen, who remained in Colorado. Bowlen suffers from Alzheimer's disease and stepped away from the franchise's day-to-day operations in 2014.
The Hall of Fame induction ceremony will be held Aug. 3, in Canton, Ohio.
For the second consecutive year, the Hall of Fame class included three players in their first years of eligibility in Bailey, Reed and Gonzalez. Those three players combined for 35 Pro Bowl selections as well as 14 first-team All-Pro nods. A year ago, Randy Moss, Ray Lewis and Brian Urlacher were named to the Hall of Fame's class of 2018 in their first years of eligibility.

The run of first-time-eligible players getting fitted for the Hall's signature gold jacket might not be slowed in the next two years, when former Steelers safety Troy Polamalu, former Colts wide receiver Reggie Wayne and former 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis are among the first-time-eligible players.
In 2021, it becomes even more of a star-studded field as former Colts and Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, former Packers and Raiders defensive back Charles Woodson and former Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson will be among the first-time-eligible players.
The board of selectors met for 7¬Ω hours Saturday ahead of Super Bowl LIII. This year's finalists included five defensive backs among the 15 modern-era finalists -- former Broncos safety Steve Atwater, who made the cutdown from 15 finalists to 10 earlier Saturday morning, and John Lynch were the others. Four offensive linemen -- Mawae, Steve Hutchinson, Alan Faneca and Tony Boselli -- were among the 15 finalists.
But Saturday's class marks a general departure from the usual Hall voting, given that offensive players make up roughly 60 percent of those currently enshrined to 40 percent for defensive players.
Reed is the first pure safety in 33 years to get voted into the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility after a career that began in 2002 and ended after the 2013 season. The previous one to reach on the first ballot was Ken Houston in 1986. Among the modern-era finalists, the discussion about Reed inside the selection room Saturday was the shortest, lasting just 2 minutes, 20 seconds.
""Smartest player I ever coached,"" Brian Billick, Reed's former coach with the Baltimore Ravens, said.
I was a 2 star recruit... now HOF. Beyond thankful üôåüèø pic.twitter.com/fOb8MWkuMX
Bailey made 52 interceptions for the Redskins and Broncos in 1999-2013 despite being avoided by opposing quarterbacks for the majority of his career.
""This is home and timing was just right for it,"" said Bailey, who grew up in Folkston, Georgia, and played college ball at Georgia.
In a 17-year career that ended with the 2013 season, Gonzalez caught 1,325 passes, the second most in NFL history, for 111 touchdowns. He was a six-time All-Pro and made 14 Pro Bowls.
""I knew I had a good chance, I'm not going to lie about that,"" Gonzalez said of his induction. ""Still, when you hear the knock, your heart drops.""
Law, who played from 1995 through 2009, won three Super Bowls with the Patriots and returned a pick for a touchdown that gave New England an early lead in its first title victory, over the Rams following the 2001 season.
""It's surreal to get this honor while my former team is playing,"" said Law, who will be on hand when the Patriots again play the Rams for the title Sunday.
Mawae, a three-time All-Pro lineman during a career that spanned from 1994 through 2009, also said he was excited when he heard the news.
""Threw my phone across the room,"" the former Seahawk, Jet and Titan said. ""I had a higher vertical than at the combine.""
Both contributor finalists -- Bowlen and Brandt -- were lauded for their long, distinguished careers and contributions to the league. Bowlen's Broncos have had as many Super Bowl appearances as losing seasons -- seven -- since Bowlen purchased the team in 1984.
Brandt's long tenure with the Dallas Cowboys included 20 consecutive winning seasons, from the 1960s into the 1980s, marked by innovation and the establishment of the roots of the structure most teams now use in evaluating personnel.

25953879,"The full staff, announced Friday by the Jets, includes longtime NFL assistant Joe Vitt, Gase's father-in-law, and Blake Williams, the son of defensive coordinator Gregg Williams.
Adam Gase brought along six of his former Dolphins assistants and there are a few holdovers from the Jets' staff, but none on offense.
The Jets have a lot of salary-cap space, but much of that will go toward filling spots that will be vacated by veterans who have some value.
This is where it gets interesting.
Vitt and Gregg Williams were members of the New Orleans Saints' coaching staff implicated in the 2012 BountyGate scandal. In the bounty hearings, conducted by former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, Vitt accused Williams of lying in his testimony.
Vitt also said the players didn't take Williams seriously because of his ""false bravado"" and ""schtick.""
Williams wound up being suspended indefinitely (then reinstated 11 months later), while Vitt received a six-game ban. And now they're together on Gase's first staff.
Gase saw plenty of his father-in-law last season. Gase coached the Miami Dolphins while Vitt worked in the front office as the team's director of player development.
Despite having no background with Williams, Gase hired him on Jan. 15 because he wanted someone who could be the ""head coach"" of the defense. Williams, known for his aggressive scheme and edgy coaching style, went 5-3 last season as the interim coach of the Cleveland Browns.
Enter Blake Williams, who served as the Browns' linebackers coach and called the defensive plays during the second half of the season.
Initially, Gase balked at the idea of adding Blake, according to a person familiar with the situation. Gregg Williams, who once called his son ""the best young coach I've ever had on my staff,"" became frustrated with Gase, the person said.
Eventually, Gase came around, making Blake Williams a defensive assistant, not a position coach.
Blake Williams, 34, has a reputation for rubbing people the wrong way. As a St. Louis Rams assistant, he upset people in the organization by screaming at a draft prospect in a scouting-combine interview, a source said. He also was reprimanded multiple times for sitting in the wrong seat on the team bus; he kept sitting in a seat reserved for a senior member of the staff.
The Rams fired him after the 2013 season. Williams has only worked for NFL teams in which his father was on the staff.
The Jets also announced the hiring of 16 other assistants, most notably former Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter, who will coach the running backs.

25902231,"The Dallas Cowboys are not expected to extend the contract of Jason Garrett, who is in the final year of his deal, sources tell ESPN.
Wilson died at his home in the Dallas suburb of Coppell. Police said a 911 call was made from Wilson's home, where the caller said Wilson was unresponsive and CPR was in progress. Emergency personnel determined upon arrival that Wilson was dead. Police said there was no indication of foul play and that the death was under investigation.
Wilson served as Cowboys quarterbacks coach from 2007 to '17, helping develop Tony Romo into the franchise's all-time leader in touchdown passes, and Dak Prescott, who was named NFL Rookie of the Year in 2016.
Wilson was out of coaching last year after the Cowboys opted not to keep him on staff.
""Wade was a cherished and valued member of our organization as a player, a coach and a wonderful friend,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ""This is a sad day for all members of the Cowboys family as we have lost a truly great man.''
Emmitt Smith and Jason Witten were among the former teammates and players to offer their condolences on Twitter.

Wilson played for five teams in a 17-year career from 1981 to 1998, including a three-year stint with the Cowboys (1995-97), serving as the backup to Troy Aikman when they won their last Super Bowl in 1995.
Wilson started 69 games in his career, throwing 99 touchdown passes and 102 interceptions. In 1988, while a member of the Minnesota Vikings, he was named to the Pro Bowl after throwing 15 touchdown passes and winning seven of his 10 starts.
He played 10 seasons for the Vikings, leading them to the 1987 NFC Championship Game. Wilson also played for the Falcons, Saints and Raiders.

25948008,"Alford signed a three-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday, two days after being released by the Atlanta Falcons in a salary-cap move.
The Atlanta Falcons on Tuesday announced they have released starting cornerback Robert Alford.
The three-year deal is worth $22.5 million, with $13.5M guaranteed, NFL Network is reporting.
Alford joins a Cardinals secondary led by star cornerback Patrick Peterson. Vance Joseph is the team's new defensive coordinator on first-year head coach Kliff Kingsbury's coaching staff.
Because he was released, he was permitted to sign with a new team before the start of the NFL's new league year on March 13.
Alford, a second-round draft pick by the Falcons in 2013, had two years and $17 million left on his contract when he was released. He signed a four-year, $38 million extension ($21 million guaranteed) in December 2016. The Falcons saved $7.9 million against the 2019 salary cap with the move.
Alford, 30, started 76 of 88 games with the Falcons, playing 4,904 defensive snaps. He finished his Falcons stint with 291 tackles, 10 interceptions, 59 pass breakups and two defensive touchdowns. Alford probably was best known for intercepting New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in Super Bowl LI and returning the interception 82 yards for a touchdown.

25945133,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Like many fans of the Chiefs, general manager Brett Veach was concerned after seeing the recent viral video of quarterback Patrick Mahomes playing basketball.
You thought Patrick Mahomes was just the NFL MVP? üî•(via @Faiz_Jiwani, @kheuzil) pic.twitter.com/MQpeMXLKZh
Veach said on Kansas City radio station 810 WHB on Thursday that he was worried enough about the franchise quarterback risking an injury that he put in a call to Mahomes' agent, Leigh Steinberg.
""The [Chiefs] Kingdom can be assured: No more basketball for Pat. ... We were able to nip that in the bud,'' Veach said.
Mahomes was a star in basketball as well as baseball and football in high school, in Whitehouse, Texas. Veach said he was concerned that Mahomes' competitive nature wouldn't allow him to play basketball at something less than full effort.
""With Pat, everything he does is so competitive. ... He actually was in the office yesterday and we were joking about it. He was just shooting around, and all of a sudden it turns into a spin move and juking guys out. He doesn't have that filter in his mind to just have fun and not take everything so competitively,"" Veach said.
Later at a news conference, Veach called his conversation with Mahomes on Wednesday ""a lighthearted discussion.""
""I just said, 'Hey, man, you're breaking a lot of ankles out there. Just make sure you don't break your own. I don't think we need that,'"" he said.
Mahomes was the NFL's 2018 Most Valuable Player and Offensive Player of the Year in his first season as a starter. He was the second player in NFL history to throw 50 touchdown passes and for more than 5,000 yards in the same season.

25924014,"Aaron Rodgers said he could not commit to playing Sunday, but Vikings coach Mike Zimmer expects the Packers QB to be out there since ""he walks on water.""
Rodgers would only reveal that the injury suffered in the season opener against the Bears was a sprain. He wore a brace until the Nov. 4 game at New England. The 35-year-old quarterback had hinted during the season that surgery might be necessary this offseason. But because he sustained a concussion in the regular-season finale against the Lions, he did not speak to reporters after the game or the next day when players cleaned out their lockers, so no one could ask him whether surgery was necessary -- until his appearance in Atlanta this weekend before the Super Bowl.
""I feel great,"" Rodgers said on NFL Network. ""My body feels really good. Instead of getting surgery postseason, decided to kind of go through a different routine with my knee than I've done in the past, and I'm feeling really, really good. Got a concussion the last game, that's cleared up. I'm feeling really good. I'm getting back into my workout routine, but the first month of the offseason is a lot about yoga and traveling.""
Rodgers did not elaborate on his routine.
He last had surgery on that knee after the 2015 season. That procedure was described as a ""cleanup of an old injury."" That's the same knee on which Rodgers had ACL reconstruction done during college at the University of California, stemming from a high school basketball injury.
""It's the lead leg, the plant leg, it's not the brace or the back of the drop leg, which I haven't had, thankfully, a major right knee injury, but I've dealt with the left knee injury since I was 16 years old,"" Rodgers said in September shortly after the season.
""Fortunately Doc cleaned me out a few years ago after the season and it's been excellent since then.""
Rodgers said he will make his annual appearance in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am this week. He will play with his regular partner, PGA Tour winner Jerry Kelly, a Wisconsin native.
The Packers can begin their offseason program on April 1, two weeks earlier than usual, because they have a new coach, Matt LaFleur. Teams with returning head coaches can't start until April 15. Rodgers wasn't asked directly about LaFleur but acknowledged there has been ""a lot of change.""
""It's tough at first,"" Rodgers said on NFL Network. ""But it usually works out for the best, so I'm excited about what's going on in Green Bay and the future there.""

25921522,"A person with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press on Sunday night that the two sides are in discussions, but no deal has been reached. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because nothing has been finalized.
Raiders owner Mark Davis was noncommittal in a text message to ESPN's Paul Gutierrez: ""When we're ready to make the announcement, we will.""
NBC Bay Area reported earlier that an announcement of the Raiders' plans to play in San Francisco will be made this week.
In what might have been the Raiders' final game in the Oakland Coliseum, the team gave its fans a thrill to last in a 27-14 win over the Broncos on Monday.
The Raiders are looking for a home for 2019 after the city of Oakland sued the team and the NFL over the planned move to Las Vegas in 2020. The Raiders have no lease for 2019 and owner Mark Davis dropped out of negotiations with Oakland after the suit was filed in December.
The Raiders were still considering Oakland, as well as the possibility of sharing Levi's Stadium with the San Francisco 49ers. A final decision is needed soon so the NFL can start making its 2019 schedule.
""I think the hope of Mark is to continue to be in the Bay Area with the Raiders' fans,"" commissioner Roger Goodell said at a pre-Super Bowl news conference on Wednesday.
The Raiders are still planning to practice at their facility in Alameda, making staying in the Bay Area the most logical choice.
Davis has always been opposed to sharing the stadium with the 49ers, and the legal wrangling with officials in Oakland has soured him on that option, leaving the Giants' stadium in San Francisco as his possible preferred choice.
But it doesn't come without hurdles as the 49ers hold territorial rights to the city and the Raiders would need NFL approval to move there. The stadium would also need some modifications to be able to host NFL games and there would be scheduling issues to work out with the Giants, who have home games scheduled on two of the first four Sundays of the upcoming NFL season.
The stadium has been used for college football games in the past. There have been several bowl games played there, and California played its 2011 games there when Memorial Stadium was being renovated.

The Falcons QB, 33, has a league MVP, a NFC title and a lucrative contract. All that's missing is a Lombardi trophy, and he says it's his No. 1 goal.
Bryant, who will turn 44 in May, had two years and $7 million left on his contract. He was due to make $3.5 million next season. Parting ways with him saves the Falcons $2,833,332 against the 2019 salary cap.
""I am extremely grateful for everything that Matt Bryant has done for this organization over the last 10 years,"" general manager Thomas Dimitroff said in a statement announcing the move.
""There is no doubt he is one of the all-time great Falcons, as he's been an integral part of our success. This was a difficult decision but one that was necessary for us to move forward into 2019. We have the utmost respect for the person and the player that Matt is, and we wish he and his family the best going forward.""
Bryant, the Falcons' all-time leading scorer with 1,122 points, tweeted news of his departure Wednesday morning.
#theshowmustgoon pic.twitter.com/J63iycYTSY
Bryant, who has dealt with some nagging leg and back injuries, went on to say he was looking forward to bringing success and consistency to his next team, with no plans to retire.
During his stint with the Falcons, Bryant made 250 of 282 field goals (88.7 percent), including 36 of 46 from 50-plus yards. He also made 372 of 375 extra points during his 10 seasons with the Falcons. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 2016.
The Falcons likely will turn to Giorgio Tavecchio as their kicker. Tavecchio, who is signed through 2019 and will make $645,000 next season, made all five of his field goals and all eight extra points in place of Bryant last season.
The news comes a day after the Falcons parted ways with starting cornerback Robert Alford, saving $7.9 million against the 2019 salary cap.
Defensive lineman Brooks Reed also indicated on social media that he has been released, thanking the Falcons in an Instagram post for his four seasons with the team. The Falcons would save $4.5 million against the 2019 cap by releasing Reed.

25979799,"The Houston Texans have released veteran wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, the team announced Tuesday.
Demaryius Thomas says his Achilles injury won't cause his retirement but he acknowledged Sunday his future might not be with the Texans.
Thomas, 31, suffered a season-ending torn Achilles in December. He was due a non-guaranteed $14 million salary in 2019.
Thomas said last month that his return to Houston was ""up in the air"" because of the presence of young wide receivers Keke Coutee and Will Fuller V.
He said he was not thinking about retiring.
""My main priority right now is getting back healthy. I can still play, man. I'm not thinking about retirement. I just don't know where it will be,"" he told reporters, according to the Houston Chronicle.

25914549,"PHILADELPHIA -- Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz refuted multiple details in a story critical of him published last month by Philly Voice but did not dismiss the story outright, acknowledging that he could have been a better teammate as he navigated a trying year professionally.
""I know who I am, first of all. I know how I carry myself. I know I'm not perfect. I know I have flaws,"" he said during a sit-down interview with a small group of reporters at the Eagles' practice facility recently. ""So I'm not going to sit here and say it was inaccurate and completely made up. I'm not going to do that. But at the end of the day, I will say our locker room is really close. If there were guys that had issues, in hindsight, I wish we could have just talked about them. But, again, I don't know how that all happened and everything with that.""
The Eagles quarterback reflected on allegations in an article that he was a selfish teammate, and what he thought of Nick Foles' success.
The Eagles are expected to use their franchise tag on Nick Foles and then will look to trade the quarterback, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The Eagles' Zach Ertz, Fletcher Cox and Lane Johnson defended Carson Wentz after a Philly Voice report cited sources calling the quarterback ""selfish,"" ""uncompromising"" and ""egotistical.""
Wentz was described as ""egotistical,"" ""selfish"" and ""uncompromising"" in the story, which cited more than a half-dozen players and other sources, all of whom were quoted anonymously. He was accused of playing favorites and resisting certain concepts because he viewed them as ""[Nick] Foles stuff.""
Wentz said he was caught off guard by the report.
""It kind of came out of nowhere,"" he said. ""I was literally eating breakfast with my wife, and [a member of the Eagles media relations staff] texted me. Literally, we do, like, quiet time in the morning. We eat breakfast and then I go sit on the couch. So I'm about to go read my Bible and then I get that text and now I'm reading this.""
Wentz said he didn't really sense the friction internally described in the piece, but he didn't dismiss the notion out of hand.
""It's never fun to read, but to an extent, you look at it and be like, 'Well, if someone did have this perception of me, why? What have I done wrong? What can I get better at?'"" he said. ""I realize I have my shortcomings. Yes, I can be selfish. I think we all have selfishness inside of us. There's human elements to that, that I really look at and say, 'Well, I can get better.'""
A host of teammates spoke out on social media in defense of Wentz, while a senior team official described the QB as a ""good person"" with ""great character"" to ESPN's Sal Paolantonio.
""Story has no legs,"" the official added.
Wentz said he initially tried to ""play detective"" to figure out who may have contributed to the story before deciding it ultimately didn't matter.
""I'll learn from it and we'll all learn that A, things shouldn't kind of come out the way it did, and B, the pieces that I can learn from it and be a better teammate and player and all that stuff I will grow from,"" he said. ""But other than that, just turn the page.""
There were specific details inside the Philly Voice story that Wentz disputed. Asked about the notion that he was ""once verbally attacked by a highly respected teammate for not being 'a team guy,'"" Wentz said, ""I didn't know what that was. I will say I didn't know what that was about.""
While conceding he and Foles, the Eagles' backup quarterback, see the game differently to a degree and like different concepts, he flatly denied being resistant to running plays that might be associated with being ""Foles stuff."" He also pushed back on the charge he ""bullied"" offensive coordinator Mike Groh.
""Groh and I talked to each other that day when it came out, and I think we all know that never took place,"" Wentz said. ""I even go back to the year before with Frank [Reich], I know Frank has gone and said that he and I used to have these competitive arguments, but they're healthy. That stuff happens. That's, I think, what good football teams have, the ability to respectfully do that and kind of be stubborn and those things. It was the same way with Groh. In my opinion, he is a very good football mind, and in my opinion, I feel like I have something to contribute, too, so I thought we had some really healthy dialogue. To say, quote, 'bullied him,' I'd say that's kind of disrespectful to Groh. I don't think anyone bullies Coach Groh.""
Wentz acknowledged he ""maybe wasn't the greatest teammate at times"" over the past year because he was ""emotionally kind of all over the place"" as he battled multiple injuries, worked separately from the group while he rehabbed and had to watch team success from the sideline.
""You go through the [ACL] injury, and you're just 100 percent determined to get back, that's, like, what my mind is on. And looking back, were there things that maybe I neglected as a teammate and as a friend because I was just so determined and that's all that mattered?"" Wentz said.
While looking to grow as a teammate, Wentz said he's not about to drastically change his approach.
""I'm 26 years old; my personality, to some extent, ain't going to change,"" he said. ""What's gotten me here, what's gotten me successful, I'm not going to say, 'Oh, now I'm going to have this free-spirited, Cali-guy vibe.' That's just not going to change.
""Any time you're a Type A guy, there's a fine line between being pushy and shove-y and humble and humility and walking that line. Definitely learning to navigate that always and never trying to look down on anybody or make it seem like I'm better than anybody. But at the same time, as a Type A, so to speak, confident person that's confident in off-the-field things and then on the field with what we like, that's not going to change. That's not going to go anywhere. I think that's something that is a positive if used correctly.""

25940321,"This was the expected result after Stewart rushed for 17 yards on six carries and wasn't activated off injured reserve despite being healthy late in the season. He was scheduled to count $3.2 million against the salary cap in 2019.
Barkley led the NFL with 2,024 yards from scrimmage this past season. He also set a rookie record with 91 receptions and made the Pro Bowl.
In 17 of the last 18 drafts, the top QB has been picked within the first three picks. And there's no reason to think that will be different this year.
The Athletic first reported that the Giants didn't pick up Stewart's option.
General manager Dave Gettleman signed Stewart last season to a two-year deal worth up to $6.575 million. It had a $500,000 option bonus and base salary of $2.35 million this coming season.
Stewart, 31, had spent the first 10 seasons of his career with the Carolina Panthers. Gettleman was familiar with Stewart from their time together in Carolina and was hoping his strong veteran presence would be beneficial in a locker room he was intent on overhauling.
""One of the biggest issues we had last year that we had to fix was what? The locker room. And both Jonathan Stewart and [offensive lineman] Patrick Omameh are true professionals, and they were brought here for a specific purpose,"" Gettleman said after the season. ""They were brought here for other reasons than their play. Just understand that. We feel like we've turned that corner, especially with this rookie class.""
Stewart's role was minimal in part because the Giants drafted running back Saquon Barkley No. 2 overall last year. When Stewart was healthy, Barkley and Wayne Gallman were ahead of him on the depth chart.

The two most important aspects for the league in the short term -- engaging football and fans to watch -- were present. A lot had to do with top-end AAF players like Garvin, whose story is commonplace in the league.
Garvin made the Pittsburgh Steelers' roster as an undrafted free agent in 2013 out of West Virginia. He spent time with five NFL teams over six seasons, including starting three games for the Seattle Seahawks in 2017.
A free agent the majority of 2018 after the San Francisco 49ers released him, he needed a place to play. He searched for a spot after being oh-so-close to getting a prime defensive role for years.
Garvin backed up Ryan Shazier in Pittsburgh. Played primarily special teams in Washington. Played strongside linebacker, which he felt was not his natural position, for the Seahawks. Seattle gutted its defense after 2017 and Garvin was caught up in the change. Stints in Miami and San Francisco were short-lived.
""I'll be real, and I tell everybody,"" Garvin said. ""I never really got the opportunity to just be a linebacker.""
From players to coaches to GMs, the new Alliance of American Football offers another shot at the top while opening a new talent resource to the NFL.
Who's in this new league? Where can I watch? What are the major rules differences? We're answering every question.
The Head Ball Coach is back, this time as the star attraction for the Orlando Apollos. And while it may be a new league, it's going to be the same high-flying offense he's known for.
This type of opportunity might have never come for him had he continued to try to bounce around the NFL. Instead, he tried the AAF, which gave him a shot to start and potentially turn into an early star.
""I don't try to toot my own horn. I don't try to do that, but I've been around some good people,"" Garvin said. ""I played with Troy [Polamalu] for two years. I played under Larry Foote. Like, I've been with these people who have been guys. I played with Bobby Wagner, with K.J. Wright.
""Like, I'm in there with these people. I'm just always like that Temptation you never got to hear, you know what I mean? That's what I called myself.""
They all heard him Saturday after he led Orlando with 11 tackles, defended two passes, intercepted Simms twice and added a tackle for loss. In a league in which it looked like the rules favored the offense, with only five pass-rushers in non-play-action situations, it was the defense that thrived early.
Sure, there were issues on Saturday night with the technology -- particularly with its fantasy gaming app, and the San Antonio-San Diego broadcast had audio malfunctions.
But the on-field play was as good, if not better, than expected. Having no kickoffs or extra points was jarring at first, but it ultimately was unnoticeable. It's something the NFL should legitimately consider. Some of the production elements -- like having the replay official on air to transparently show the review process -- were smart. So, too, was the sub-three-hour game time. The game speed might have been a little slower, but that's unsurprising when everyone in the league is either a one-time NFL castoff or a developmental player nowhere near the level of the NFL's premier players.
""We're very, very excited about the start. We couldn't be more pleased,"" said Jeff Fisher, the former Rams and Titans head coach who serves as the AAF's head of football strategy. ""Yes, there's room for improvement. There's room for better coaching. There's room for players playing together and improving throughout the season.
""And there's room also from a tech standpoint. We had a few with some apps and all those things.""
But it was a start, and on this night, the spectators were there. Two hours before the game, men and women in makeshift togas tailgated under makeshift lights outside Spectrum Stadium.
Two police officers said it was a calmer presence than crowds that show for UCF games. It was a smaller group of people, too -- the announced attendance of 20,191 was likely generous, as the stadium never looked more than one-third full at its peak.
But the fans who were there were passionate -- already owning various Apollos paraphernalia. They roared when Steve Spurrier was introduced. They made enough noise to make it noticeable on key downs. And despite intermittent rain, a good chunk of fans stuck around to the end.
""We want to be part of this on the ground floor,"" said Eric Gorecki, 42, of Deltona, Florida, one of the fans dressed up in a toga in the parking lot. ""Because we think it's going to be very successful.""
Fans around him agreed. In the NFL season, they are Minnesota Vikings fans -- they even tailgated under a Vikings tent. Orlando had no pro team to call its own, so when Orlando was given an AAF team, they were in.
Two attended the Apollos' draft party. They experienced the way the club -- starting with Twitter-engaging team president Michael Waddell, a former college administrator at Arkansas and Illinois -- interacted with and embraced the fans.
""That's 50 percent of why we've embraced it,"" said Jesse Solum, 49. ""The fan access.""
On this night, the access would be good. A large contingent of fans waited outside the locker room after the game, where Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston also popped up. Apollos players reached up to railings to sign autographs after the rout. Following his media responsibilities, QB Garrett Gilbert stopped to take photos with fans on the concourse while speaking with a reporter.
It's a different world, a different lifestyle -- a minor league feel with the hopes of reaching the big time.
""I really liked it. I thought we had a real nice crowd,"" Garvin said. ""They were into the game. It wasn't like an atmosphere where they were out there just sitting around. They were really cheering.
""I really felt like it was a home game.""
For the AAF on Saturday, with everything being a first, it's a start good enough to build on.

25932132,"Bates, 25, pleaded not guilty to charges of assault, resisting arrest, theft of services and obstruction of governmental administration.
Bates has been hospitalized since his Jan. 26 arrest and was arraigned via a video hookup.
Bates' lawyer, Eric Breslin, said they were looking forward to ""resolving this matter in an expeditious and satisfactory fashion.""
Bates was arrested around 1:30 a.m. Jan. 26 at a hotel near LaGuardia Airport after allegedly refusing to pay a $32 cab fare for a ride from Manhattan.
Police have said they were ready to let Bates go with an appearance ticket if he didn't have any outstanding warrants, but that Bates refused to be fingerprinted and punched a sergeant in the face.
Sgt. James O'Brien, who was hit as he tried to calm Bates down, suffered a concussion and needed three stitches over his left eye, police said.
The 6-foot-2, 240-pound Bates was subdued with a stun gun and taken to a hospital.
Bates' agent said last week that the alleged actions ""are in no way a reflection of who he is as a person"" and ""not at all consistent with the man and friend we know him to be.""
""At this time our priority is to ensure that Trevor receives the help he needs and that the privacy of the parties involved be respected,"" agent Jeff Jankovich said in a Jan. 28 statement.
Bates, who's from Westbrook, Maine, and played college football at the University of Maine, joined the Lions last year and appeared in nine games.
He was drafted in 2016 by the Indianapolis Colts and was on the practice squads of the New England Patriots and New York Giants.
Lions general manager Bob Quinn has said that the team is aware of Bates' arrest but had no further comment.
Judge Karina Alomar set Bates' bail at $5,000 cash or $10,000 bond. His next hearing is scheduled for March 8.
Bates faces up to seven years in prison if convicted.

25919634,"ATLANTA -- In a season that opened with a four-game suspension, New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman closed a championship run as the MVP of Super Bowl LIII.
In a tight-fisted defensive affair, Edelman did some roll-up-the-sleeves work on offense, with 10 catches for 141 yards in the Patriots' 13-3 win over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Points were hard to come by for both teams in the lowest-scoring Super Bowl of all time, and as the Patriots put together one touchdown drive in the game, Edelman was the consistent go-to guy on offense.
Julian Edelman is the fourth offensive player to win Super Bowl MVP without scoring a touchdown.
""[It's] pretty surreal. Tough times don't last. Tough people do,'' Edelman said. ""I preach that. ... I have to try to live to that.''
Edelman is the seventh wide receiver to earn Super Bowl MVP honors and the first since Santonio Holmes in Super Bowl XLIII. Desmond Howard also won the game's MVP honors as a returner.
Edelman closed at 25-1 to win MVP at the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook.
Edelman joins a list of receivers to win MVP that includes Hall of Famers Lynn Swann, Fred Biletnikoff and Jerry Rice. He is the second Patriots wide receiver to earn Super Bowl MVP honors, following Deion Branch in Super Bowl XXXIX, New England's third of six Super Bowl wins with Tom Brady at quarterback.
It was Edelman's sixth career postseason game with at least 100 yards receiving and his second 100-yard game this postseason. He finished with nine receptions for 151 yards in the Patriots' divisional-round win over the Los Angeles Chargers. Edelman's 115 career postseason receptions are now second only to Rice's total.
""I think we just had to worry about one play at a time and keep knocking at the door,'' Edelman said. ""It wasn't pretty, but we'll take an ugly win over a pretty loss any day.''
The future of football might be offense, but Bill Belichick showed on Sunday night that while he's still coaching defense isn't dead yet.
From the Bay Area to the NFL record books, the Patriots tandem has developed a chemistry that proved critical in Super Bowl LIII.
Quarterback Tom Brady became the first player in NFL history to win six Super Bowls, as the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 in Super Bowl LIII on Sunday night.
""He played the best game of the year,'' Brady said. ""He's a fighter. I'm just so proud of him. He's been an incredible player for this team.''
The Rams were able -- with the power of their defensive front and the occasional matchup of cornerback Aqib Talib on Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski when Gronkowski lined up out wide -- to unsettle Brady some in the early going.
Brady's first pass attempt of the game, after the Patriots opened with four consecutive running plays, was intercepted by Rams linebacker Cory Littleton after the ball was tipped by Nickell Robey-Coleman.
Edelman had just one catch on the next possession, when Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski missed a 46-yard field goal attempt. From that point on, the Patriots successfully moved Edelman around the formation -- Talib also matched up on Edelman several times when Edelman lined up in the slot -- and often put Edelman and Gronkowski on the same side.
""We were just grinding it out,'' Brady said. ""We were able to put some things together. ... I just felt like we had to keep grinding it out all night.''
The result was that Brady was able to get the Patriots' offense moving when he consistently got the ball to Edelman. Edelman finished the first half with seven catches for 93 yards, a total that included four of Brady's six completions of at least 10 yards in the opening half.
Edelman had a 13-yard catch on the Patriots' only touchdown drive of the night: a five-play, 69-yard effort that concluded with a 2-yard touchdown run by Sony Michel with seven minutes remaining in the third quarter. The Patriots' defense also did its part, holding the high-powered Rams to 260 yards as New England sacked Rams quarterback Jared Goff four times to go with an interception.
Julian Edelman had 10 receptions for 141 yards en route to becoming the seventh wide receiver named Super Bowl MVP.
""[I] was just trying to get open.... I was asked to make a couple plays, and we were able to do that,'' Edelman said. ""The defense was unreal. ... It's pretty crazy. They should be MVP on D.''
It was a long way from when Edelman missed the 2017 season, including the Patriots' loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII a year ago, after suffering a torn ACL in a preseason game. He then missed the first four games of the 2018 regular season due to a suspension for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.
Edelman did not publicly reveal what substance he tested positive for during the regular season, but he said he had to ""be accountable'' for the suspension.
Each of the Patriots' past two Super Bowl MVPs were suspended for the first four games of that season. Brady received a four-game ban in 2016 for his role in the Deflategate scandal before earning Super Bowl LI MVP honors.
Edelman narrowly missed a $500,000 bonus for touchdowns catches to close the 2018 regular season, but he acknowledged last month that wasn't a concern, saying, ""I don't play the game for that. I play the game to try to go out and win championships.''
He now holds a place among the league's postseason heroes with his third Super Bowl win in 18 career playoff games.
""It was unreal,'' Edelman said. ""Sometimes the cookie crumbles that way.''

TE Charles Clay. When he signed Clay as a transition-tagged free agent in 2015, former Bills GM Doug Whaley thought he was simultaneously improving his team and dealing a blow to the division-rival Dolphins. Instead, the Bills are still feeling the salary-cap effect of Clay's contract, which included $24.5 million in guaranteed money and was restructured in 2016 to push money later into the deal. Clay is likely to be released this offseason after catching only 21 passes for 184 yards in 2018; his last touchdown catch was in Week 3 of 2017. -- Mike Rodak

WR DeVante Parker. The Dolphins have given Parker, their 2015 first-round pick, every opportunity to become their No. 1 receiver, but his underwhelming return and injury-prone four seasons in Miami have been a big damper on his relationship with the team. Much of Miami's fan base has soured on Parker too, and it seems like a fresh start would be beneficial for both parties. Parker has a $9.4 million fifth-year option that would become guaranteed next month, but it's a near certainty that Miami will make a roster decision on him before that becomes final. -- Cameron Wolfe

DT Malcom Brown. The 2015 first-round draft choice (No. 32 overall) started and made significant contributions to two Super Bowl championship teams, but the Patriots declined his fifth-year option for 2019. That option would have paid him in the $8 million range, which provides evidence that the team views him as more of a two-down player who comes off the field in obvious passing situations. Can Brown be more than that? It's possible, and finding a scheme that brings that out of him would make sense from his perspective. -- Mike Reiss

DL Henry Anderson. This is strictly scheme-related. He enjoyed a career year in 2018 (seven sacks), but he isn't an ideal fit in the 4-3 scheme that will be installed by new defensive coordinator Gregg Williams. Anderson has always played his best ball in a 3-4 front, going back to his days with the Colts. He will be a free agent for the first time, and he's expected to receive offers from three or four teams. -- Rich Cimini

WR Michael Crabtree. No Raven was in need of a change of scenery more than Joe Flacco and he got just that on Wednesday when he was traded to the Broncos. Crabtree and the Ravens could also benefit from a split. Baltimore would get $4.66 million in cap savings by moving on from the 10-year veteran, who had 54 catches for 607 yards and three touchdowns in 2018. And Crabtree would have the chance to find a more accurate quarterback than Lamar Jackson, who electrified the Ravens with his playmaking but was an inconsistent passer. As a starter, only half of Jackson's passes to wide receivers resulted in completions, better than only the Bengals during that time frame.

TE Tyler Eifert. This one could go either way, as Eifert is scheduled to become a free agent. Due to recurring injuries, Eifert has never played a full season, but it appeared to be a freak accident when he broke his ankle in September. Eifert's future is less clear than ever. He could attempt to get a fresh start elsewhere or try one more time to come back on a one-year deal. But with all three of the team's starting tight ends set to become free agents, the Bengals can't afford to lose everyone. -- Katherine Terrell

QB Tyrod Taylor. He came to the Browns expecting to start and lost his job after three games. In Cleveland, he'd be a backup, a role he probably doesn't relish. He turns 30 in August, still believes he can play and would probably prefer to find a team that will give him a chance. -- Pat McManamon
Jeremy Fowler joins SportsCenter to explain what's next for Antonio Brown after his tweet directed toward Steelers Nation.

WR Antonio Brown. This one's easy, though Le'Veon Bell easily could slide into this spot. As if photoshopping himself into a San Francisco 49ers jersey wasn't enough of a signal, Brown officially made his trade demands clear with a farewell video posted Tuesday. The Steelers were exploring a trade for Brown even before his recent domestic dispute in South Florida. The Steelers will miss Brown's playmaking but could reset the passing game with JuJu Smith-Schuster and James Washington. -- Jeremy Fowler

RB Alfred Blue. The running back is headed to free agency after playing in all 16 games for just the second time in his five-year career. Lamar Miller, the primary back, had 60 more rushing attempts than Blue, despite playing two fewer games. A fresh start might give Blue a better chance to be a team's featured running back. -- Turron Davenport

QB Jacoby Brissett. Brissett didn't do anything wrong in 2018. He basically did everything right. He was a great backup to Andrew Luck and supporter of his teammates. He started taking part in the defense's celebrations in the end zone after a turnover. Brissett, who started 15 games in 2017, needs a new team because he deserves the opportunity to be a starting quarterback in this league. That isn't going to happen with the Colts because Luck proved last season that his surgically repaired right shoulder is healed, and there's a chance he'll be an MVP candidate next season. -- Mike Wells

QB Blake Bortles. The Jaguars made a mistake by signing him to a three-year extension through 2020 after he posted the best season of his career in 2017. Bortles couldn't maintain that level of play (which shouldn't be a surprise since he has been a streaky player throughout his career), and he struggled badly after a hot start last season. He has thrown 103 TD passes in five seasons, but it's clear he isn't the Jaguars' QB of the future. He might not ever be an elite QB, but he can be a solid backup -- somewhere else. -- Mike DiRocco

OL Quinton Spain. The shift from a power running scheme to a gap scheme didn't bode well for the 6-foot-5, 335-pound offensive lineman. A lot of the pressure on quarterback Marcus Mariota came from the interior. Spain was benched after the first half of the Titans' Week 13 game against the Jets. He's more of a people mover who would benefit from being in a scheme that utilizes man-on-man blocking. Fellow guard Josh Kline is another player who could use a change of scenery, but Spain is set to be a free agent, and Tennessee will likely replace him with an interior offensive lineman in this year's draft. -- Turron Davenport

CB Bradley Roby. Roby, the Broncos' first-round pick in the 2014 draft, was supposed to show in 2018 that he was ready to be a starter after Aqib Talib was traded. It didn't work out that way. He had likely his worst game as a pro in a loss to the New York Jets -- he was a key defender on three Jets touchdowns -- and an inconsistent season overall. He wasn't always assignment-sound, and by the end of the season, he had his effort questioned by Monday Night Football analyst Jason Witten. Roby is set to be an unrestricted free agent, and he will move on at a high-demand position in the league. The Broncos put him in a prove-it situation, so he knows their plans to re-sign him likely hinged on a far better season than he had. -- Jeff Legwold

LB Tanoh Kpassagnon. He appears unlikely to fulfill the potential the Chiefs believed he had when they drafted him in the second round in 2017. Last year, the Chiefs felt compelled to trade up to draft Breeland Speaks, who plays the same position. He was a healthy scratch for two of the final three games in the regular season and one in the playoffs. -- Adam Teicher

CB Jason Verrett. The TCU product tore his Achilles tendon during a conditioning drill the day before training camp, forcing him to miss the entire 2018 season. Verrett has missed 65 of a possible 80 games in five seasons with the Chargers and hasn't played a full season since being selected in the first round of the 2014 draft. Scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent in March, Verrrett is a Pro Bowl player when healthy but might stand a better chance of displaying his talent in new surroundings. -- Eric D. Williams

CB Rashaan Melvin. A much ballyhooed free-agent signing last spring, Melvin quickly ran afoul of coach Jon Gruden when he tweeted on Oct. 15 that he was ""frustrated and upset ... tired of it"" while pledging that he was ""done trying to change my style. It's not me. Back to what I know and what got me here!"" Gruden's response? ""Melvin is on his seventh team, I think. He's had different techniques. Maybe he's confused."" Melvin, who signed a one-year, $5.5 million deal with Oakland and had one interception, started the Raiders' first five games, was inactive for two after his social media diatribe, came off the bench for seven and started the final two. But with the dual emergence of Gareon Conley and Daryl Worley at cornerback, along with his frustrations, Melvin could use a change of scenery, unless he's amenable to a different role. -- Paul Gutierrez

DT David Irving. He has played in 10 of the past 32 games because of suspension or injury. As talented as he is -- he has eight sacks in those 10 games -- he's unreliable. He entered 2018 with a four-game suspension for violating the substance abuse policy and needed a big season in a contract year. He suffered a high ankle sprain in practice in November and never returned. He was not around the facility much as he dealt with off-field personal issues and was not diligent with his rehab. When he worked out for Jerry Jones and the front office late in the season, he was out of shape. Jones loves a good deal, and he could get Irving back for next to nothing, but if the Cowboys want the ""right kind of guy"" around, they need to let Irving become another team's problem. -- Todd Archer

LB B.J. Goodson. The Giants traded for veteran middle linebacker Alec Ogletree last offseason. He's a similar player to Goodson, the Giants' fourth-round pick in 2016. That left Goodson as a part-time player this past season and limited his production and growth. With the Giants committed to Ogletree financially this season, Goodson might be better off on another team. -- Jordan Raanan

CB Ronald Darby. He tore his ACL in November and started just half the team's games the past two seasons due to injury. The Eagles might choose to ride with their young draft picks in Jalen Mills, Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas rather than re-up Darby, who is set to become a free agent. Just 25 years old and with plenty of speed and ability, Darby should have some suitors. -- Tim McManus

LB Zach Brown. He was a starter for most of the past two seasons, and the Redskins re-signed him last offseason, though it was far from a unanimous decision in the organization. Brown was eventually benched, done in by missing too many practices for what they termed ""illnesses."" That allowed rookie Shaun Dion Hamilton a chance to show his progress in practice and led to Brown's benching. He still played a role in sub packages, but he told the media that he saw the ""writing on the wall."" Both sides could use a change in this situation. Getting rid of Brown would save the Redskins $5.75 million in cap space (with a pre-June 1 release). -- John Keim
Rex Ryan doesn't have sympathy for Bears kicker Cody Parkey missing the potential game-winning field goal against the Eagles.

K Cody Parkey. Yes, you can look at the kick that bounced off two posts (and the ""Today"" show appearance after) that eliminated Chicago from the playoffs as the main reason he needs to be in a new place, but it goes beyond that. Parkey missed seven field goal attempts and three extra points in the regular season, including three field goals from inside 40 yards and six from inside 50 yards. Soldier Field might be an incredibly difficult place to kick, but that type of work from inside 50 yards is just poor. -- Michael Rothstein

DL Kerry Hyder. A breakout player in Detroit in 2016 who missed all of 2017 with an Achilles injury, Hyder never seemed to fit with the Lions in 2018. He remained on the roster but was active for just seven games (with one sack). He was a healthy scratch most weeks -- a long way from his eight-sack 2016. It's tough to know if he has any of his burst remaining because the Lions just opted not to use him. An aggressive 4-3 team might be best for him -- or going where coaches are familiar with his game. -- Michael Rothstein

OLB Nick Perry. The Packers hoped his 11-sack season in 2016 wasn't a fluke. It looks like they were wrong. Injury issues returned the past two seasons, when he combined to miss 11 games. His 2018 season ended after nine games (and just 1.5 sacks) because of a knee injury. He already has collected $28 million of a five-year, $60 million deal. He is owed a $4.8 million roster bonus on March 16, and it's hard to imagine the Packers paying it, even though they're thin on edge rushers. -- Rob Demovsky

WR Laquon Treadwell. The Vikings gave it their best shot, but the Treadwell experiment never panned out the way they hoped. At this rate, it seems highly unlikely that Minnesota will exercise Treadwell's fifth-year option for 2020. Although the franchise is up against the salary cap and would incur around $2.5 million in dead money to cut the former first-rounder, the writing has been on the wall for quite some time. Treadwell offered the Vikings little trade value when they explored moving him prior to roster cut-down day in 2018 and at the trade deadline. He was even benched (a healthy scratch) in favor of undrafted free-agent receiver Chad Beebe in Week 16 vs. Detroit. While there's time for him to turn around a career that has yielded 56 receptions for 517 yards and a touchdown in three seasons (including a team-high 5 drops in 2018), it's in the best interest of both sides to part ways. -- Courtney Cronin

RB Tevin Coleman. Although Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff previously said he could see a scenario in which the team signed Coleman to pair with Devonta Freeman into the future, that scenario seems highly unlikely. The Falcons gave Freeman an extension through 2022 worth $8.25 million per year, so they probably won't pay Coleman. He likely will land a lucrative deal elsewhere, with a chance to be the primary back with his explosive ability. -- Vaughn McClure

Le'Veon Bell's landing spot, blockbuster trades, draft moves -- we have fearless predictions that would shake up the NFL.
What's in store this offseason? Nick Foles and Le'Veon Bell head south, Antonio Brown moves west, and Browns fans make playoff plans.
When might Le'Veon Bell sign with a new team? Which rules are set for a makeover? What happens next with replay? Here's an in-depth look at the offseason.
WR Devin Funchess. He went from No. 1 receiver to start the 2018 season to being phased out down the stretch in favor of first-round pick DJ Moore and 2017 second-round pick Curtis Samuel. An unrestricted free agent, Funchess never really fit into a Norv Turner offense that relies on a lot of quick, high-percentage passes, but he's still a capable receiver who can play in multiple spots. He had one of the best catches of the year this past season. He just won't be worth what he'll likely demand in free agency. -- David Newton

QB Teddy Bridgewater. I hate saying this because it would be such a great fit for both Bridgewater and the Saints if they could ""save"" Bridgewater to eventually replace Drew Brees. But unless Brees gives some sort of assurance that he's going to play only one more year, Bridgewater is ready to be a starter now that he has proved he is healthy. There aren't too many obvious openings around the league. But Miami, Jacksonville and perhaps the New York Giants, Washington or Denver could make sense among other possibilities. -- Mike Triplett

WR DeSean Jackson. This is a no-brainer, even with new head coach Bruce Arians expressing his desire to keep Jackson. Jackson has one year left on his deal and is due $10 million next season (none of it guaranteed), but he has not been able to establish the necessary chemistry with Jameis Winston on the deep ball, and his frustration only grew this past season when Winston regained his starting job and Ryan Fitzpatrick was benched. There are some within the Bucs' organization who aren't ready to give up on this, but considering the Bucs have only $15 million in cap space heading into 2019 and a ton of other needs, a trade and unloading a big contract while allowing Jackson a fresh start seems like a win-win. -- Jenna Laine

C A.Q. Shipley. He signed a one-year extension in August after he tore his ACL to keep him on the roster in 2019. But Shipley, who before his injury was one of the most reliable Cardinals the past few seasons, might not have a place on the roster with the emergence of center Mason Cole, who took his spot post-injury. Cole was drafted in the third round to be the center of the future, which came sooner than everyone expected. There are two scenarios in which Shipley could see the field in 2019: The Cardinals ask Cole to play guard for a year or two and reinsert Shipley as the starting center or Shipley moves to guard. If neither of those scenarios plays out, Shipley might be better suited for a starting center job elsewhere. -- Josh Weinfuss

QB Sean Mannion. Mannion, a third-round pick in 2015, is a pending free agent and has spent his four seasons in the NFL serving as a backup for Nick Foles, Case Keenum and Jared Goff. It's unlikely that Mannion would elevate to a starter for another team, but he still could benefit from a change of scenery. Mannion had a lackluster preseason for the Rams, and confidence about whether he could fill in for Goff wavered. In four seasons, Mannion has completed 33 of 53 passes for 258 yards, with an interception. -- Lindsey Thiry

LB Malcolm Smith. One of the first free-agent signees of the Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch era, Smith has never been fully healthy in his two seasons with the team and has offered little production because of it. Smith played in just 12 games over two seasons with 35 tackles and is scheduled to count almost $5.5 million against the cap in 2019. The 49ers have some intriguing young players at linebacker and should be on the lookout for more in the offseason, which makes it hard to envision Smith returning, barring a significant salary reduction. -- Nick Wagoner
S Earl Thomas. This is an easy call with all the drama of the past 13 months. It started with Thomas tracking down Jason Garrett after a Christmas Eve game in 2017 and telling the Cowboys coach to ""come get me"" if he were to become available. It continued with Thomas holding out last offseason as he sought an extension or a trade, returning for the opener, then declining to take part in a few practices. It ended with Thomas flipping the bird toward the Seahawks' sideline in Arizona after breaking his leg. An extension would have been plausible had Thomas stayed healthy and continued to play at his All-Pro level in 2018. He picked off three passes in four games before he was hurt and has been a pillar of Seattle's defense in the Pete Carroll era. But his middle finger felt like a final goodbye for one of the greatest Seahawks of all time. -- Brady Henderson

25938583,"Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Antonio Brown allegedly pushed the mother of his daughter to the ground on Jan. 17 in Hollywood, Florida, according to a police incident report obtained by ESPN.
The Hollywood Police Department on Tuesday acknowledged that Brown was involved in a domestic dispute last month, but has said it does not have further details and won't be commenting until it does. Brown was not arrested.
The case is not in the police department's database. When reached Wednesday, the records department said the case is still under review.
The incident allegedly took place when the woman dropped off Brown's daughter at his residence and asked to be reimbursed for the child's hair appointment. According to the incident report, the woman positioned herself so Brown could not close his front door and Brown told her she needed to leave his residence. According to the woman, Brown then used both hands to push her to the ground.
The running back and the franchise probably are headed for more hostility over how he's tagged, with the real possibility of arbitration.
What's in store this offseason? Nick Foles and Le'Veon Bell head south, Antonio Brown moves west, and Browns fans make playoff plans.
The woman told police that her wrist was injured in the fall. Police said that she showed them ""an abrasion with some scabbing.""
The woman refused to complete a victim affidavit, according to police. Officers told the woman they could pursue an arrest of Brown for battery if they find probable cause and the state attorney's office files charges, according to the report. The woman got upset with the officers and stated she did not want Brown arrested and instead wanted to ""cancel"" her report.
The NFL has confirmed that it is looking into the incident.
Brown's lawyer, Darren Heitner, said in a statement Wednesday that ""the closed police report proves that Antonio Brown did absolutely nothing wrong."" He also said Brown would be seeking full custody of his daughter because of the incident.
""Unfortunately, the media alluded wrongdoing on the part of my client in a 'domestic dispute' when in fact no wrongdoing ever occurred on his part. The complainant, who is the mother of Mr. Brown's child, acknowledged that she refused to leave Mr. Brown's property after being asked and further refused to leave the doorway of his personal residence. The complainant did not want to provide a statement or press charges, and asked to retract her report after it was made,"" Heitner said.
""The media must be held to a higher standard and should issue an apology to my client for harming his reputation without cause and without full report in their possession. Additionally, the complainant unnecessarily involved my client's minor child in her false reporting, causing irreparable harm to a minor child. Therefore, Antonio Brown's family law attorney, Jaclyn Soroka, Esq. will be filing an action with the Court today seeking full legal custody of his child accordingly.""
Brown has five children -- four sons and one daughter.
This is Brown's second recent legal issue in South Florida, where he was born and raised.
In October, he faced two lawsuits from an April incident during which Brown allegedly yelled at security and threw items off an apartment balcony, according to documents obtained by ESPN.
A guardian of a 2-year-old boy is suing Brown for ""intentional infliction of emotional distress and assault"" after items flung from the 14th floor of the Mansions at Acqualina nearly hit the child, according to Miami-Dade County court filings.
Those cases are in the process of being resolved.
On the morning of Nov. 8, Brown was cited for driving over 100 mph in Ross Township, Pennsylvania. That evening, after the Steelers' Week 10 victory over the Carolina Panthers, Brown declined comment when approached by ESPN, then told teammates that reporters couldn't catch him as he walked out of the locker room.  Before the season, Brown publicly threatened an ESPN writer over a story examining the intersection of Brown's media stardom with his off-field life.
Brown, 30, has been one of the NFL's most productive players, with a league-record six consecutive 100-catch seasons. However, the Steelers are considering trading him after he failed to show up to work the day before the season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Earlier that week, Brown was involved in a heated dispute at practice; according to multiple reports, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was involved in that incident.
Team president Art Rooney II told reporters last month that something changed with Brown the last week of the season and he wasn't sure why. He had reached out to Brown to no avail. Agent Drew Rosenhaus told ESPN on Jan. 25 he has spoken to the Steelers to express Brown's ""position"" but wouldn't divulge details.
""There aren't many signs out there that [returning] is going to happen,"" Rooney II said. ""But like I said before: We haven't made any decisions, and we are going to take our time.""

25900829,"METAIRIE, La. -- Drew Brees took issue with the fact that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell waited 10 days to publicly address the officiating error that went against the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship Game.
Brees made the media rounds Friday at the Super Bowl. While he repeatedly stressed that the Saints can only control what they can control, which includes errors they made in the game before and after the missed pass interference and helmet-to-helmet no-calls, Brees also expressed his disappointment over Goodell's silence.
""I think that we all recognize that being in that position, you are the face of the league. And you have the responsibility to come out and address issues when they come about,"" Brees told ""The Dan Patrick Show."" ""And I would say that on Monday or Tuesday after that game we all deserved a response of some kind.
""I mean, do I really want to be in a position talking about this over and over again? No. But I have to stand up and do it because I have to represent my team, represent the Who Dat nation, and that's my responsibility. So it's the commissioner's responsibility to do the same thing, and yet we don't hear a peep for 10 days. And it's because he has to do it now because he's at the Super Bowl and he does his annual press conference.""
Brees made similar comments on the ""Today"" show, adding, ""I don't think he really said much during most of that press conference.""
""But at the end of the day,"" Brees continued, ""for us as players, we can only worry about the things that we can control. So you understand that officials have a very tough job, and there's a lot of calls that are made and not made throughout the course of a game. It's just tough when something that meaningful happens at the end of the NFC Championship Game that arguably would've sent us to the Super Bowl. And the call wasn't made, and it was a very, very obvious call.""
Brees said definitively on both ESPN's First Take and ""The Dan Patrick Show"" that he plans to come back for a 19th season and keep playing at age 40.
He also described the loss as ""arguably one of the most devastating losses for me in my career.""
Brees said his children were crying after the game because of how invested they are too -- though he joked that his 10-year-old may have been crying because Mom had promised him a cellphone if the Saints went to the Super Bowl.
""Listen, it's gonna take some mental toughness,"" Brees said of being able to get over the loss. ""But I believe we're up for it. I was impressed with what our team was able to do this year coming off last year [another heartbreaking playoff loss in the 'Minneapolis Miracle'].
The QB is competing for his third NFL Offensive Player of the Year award, so let's revisit what made those TDs special with the guys who caught them.
In the aftermath of the Rams-Saints no-call, we're left wondering why officials do what they do. It's simple: for the love of the game.
Everything you need to know about the officiating for Super Bowl LIII, including the potential for roughing the passer flags on these aggressive defensive fronts.
""I like where we're at as a team. I like this window of opportunity. But we are gonna have to put this behind us. We are gonna have to allow this to make us become stronger in some way, turn this into a positive somehow, some way. And that's difficult. That's not easy to do.""
As for the mistakes the Saints made, Brees talked at length on First Take about the decision to try for a touchdown in the final two minutes of regulation instead of running the ball three times and settling for a field goal.
That has been the second-most hotly debated topic coming out of the Saints' loss. But Brees said with ""respect"" to the Rams' offense, the Saints didn't want to settle for a field goal and leave Los Angeles with 55 seconds remaining to try to tie the game. And he said the incomplete pass to wide receiver Michael Thomas on first down was ""on me.""
""We knew we were gonna get all-out pressure. So we called a run play with a built-in, 'Get it out to Mike Thomas.'"" Brees said. ""Listen, that's a pass I gotta complete to him, in my mind. So I'm putting that on me. I'm not putting that on anyone else. The next play we had an opportunity to have a bigger play [on an Alvin Kamara run]; we didn't block it correctly. That's on us.
""Then comes the third down. Man, we had a great play. We caught 'em off guard. Their nickel was out of position. He's scrambling to cover Tommylee Lewis out of the backfield. He admitted in the press conference afterward that he intentionally hit him because that was better than giving up a touchdown. So that's the chess match within the framework of the game.""
Brees told ""The Dan Patrick Show"" that the third-down play was ironically called ""Buckhead"" -- named for a popular area in Atlanta, where the Super Bowl is being held.
""Yeah, it was a play that was hopefully going to get us to Atlanta, right?"" Brees said.
With the Super Bowl in Miami next year, Brees added, ""I can almost guarantee we'll have a 'South Beach' at some point next year.""

Simmons was rated as the No. 12 overall draft prospect in the latest big board from ESPN's Mel Kiper, and he was projected to be the No. 7 overall pick by the Jaguars in ESPN draft expert Todd McShay's latest mock draft.

25973726,"The Cleveland Browns signed troubled running back Kareem Hunt on Monday.
A source told ESPN's Adam Schefter that Hunt signed a one-year contract. He will be a restricted free agent after the contract expires, meaning the Browns will control his rights after next season.
The Kansas City Chiefs released Hunt in November after a video surfaced that showed him shoving and kicking a woman last February at his residence in Cleveland.
He neither was arrested nor faced charges for the February incident. He also was accused of punching a man in June.
The Browns are giving running back Kareem Hunt a second chance. Here's what needs to happen for him to play again and what that means for Nick Chubb and Duke Johnson.
Outside the Lines interviewed witnesses and reviewed police documents and nearly four hours of officer bodycam video for the most complete account to date of the night that jeopardized Kareem Hunt's NFL career.
The NFL placed Hunt on the commissioner's exempt list shortly before he was released. He is not eligible to play until the NFL completes its investigation into the incidents and a decision on potential discipline is made.
A source close to the situation told ESPN's Dan Graziano that the discipline process was ""still ongoing and nowhere near done."" A source told Graziano that Hunt met with NFL investigators in January as part of the process.
Hunt, now that he has signed, will again be placed on the commissioner's exempt list until the NFL makes a final decision on discipline.
Browns general manager John Dorsey drafted Hunt for the Chiefs in 2017, when Dorsey was the team's GM.
""I want everybody to know we have done extensive research in regards to this case, this player,"" Dorsey told reporters during media availability Monday. ""He understands and takes full responsibility for the egregious act he committed. He is extremely remorseful for his actions.""
Dorsey said he talked to many people about Hunt, but did not talk to the woman, nor did he talk to groups that deal with domestic violence or violence against women. He said he did not reach out to the woman.
Hunt, 23, apologized to the woman in the February incident, the Chiefs organization and his family in an interview with ESPN after his release.
He apologized again in a Browns statement on Monday.
""First off, I would like to once again apologize for my actions last year. What I did was wrong and inexcusable. That is not the man I was raised to be, and I've learned a great deal from that experience and certainly should have been more truthful about it after the fact. I'm extremely grateful that John Dorsey, Dee and Jimmy Haslam and the Cleveland Browns organization are granting me the opportunity to earn their trust and represent their organization in the best way possible on and off the field,"" he said.
""I am committed to following the necessary steps to learn and to be a better and healthier person from this situation. I also understand the expectations that the Browns have clearly laid out and that I have to earn my way back to the NFL. I'm a work in progress as a person, but I'm committed to taking advantage of the support systems that I have in place to become the best and healthier version of myself.""
Dorsey said Hunt voluntarily began counseling shortly after he was released by the Chiefs and ""is now working toward being a better man going forward.""
He added that Hunt's signing is ""by no means ... a guarantee of anything. As we all know, trust has to be earned. That has to be earned with the Cleveland Browns organization and the community of Cleveland moving forward. This will be a day-to-day thing with earning trust.""
Asked if the Browns would have a zero tolerance policy with regard to Hunt, Dorsey replied, ""You know what, I'll say yes.""
Dorsey said he expects the NFL's investigation to wrap up in a couple of weeks and he hopes Hunt is present April 1 for the start of offseason workouts.
Hunt led the NFL in rushing in 2017 as a rookie with 1,327 yards and eight touchdowns in helping Kansas City qualify for the playoffs. He also had 53 receptions for 455 yards and three touchdowns. Last season, he rushed for 824 yards and seven touchdowns in 11 games and had seven receiving touchdowns before he was released.
""I know this, if you talked to anybody who's been in the locker room with Kareem Hunt, they'll tell you he was a really good teammate,"" Dorsey later told a handful of beat reporters.
Hunt's signing is a bit of a surprise given the Browns have a talented corps of backs. Nick Chubb ran for 996 yards in nine starts as a rookie, and averaged 5.2 yards per carry. The team also has Duke Johnson, who is a very accomplished change-of-pace back and receiver out of the backfield. Johnson also averaged 5 yards per carry (on 40 carries) in 2018, and in 2017 had 1,041 total yards and seven touchdowns. The Browns signed Johnson to a three-year, $15.6 million contract last June. He is under contract with the Browns through the 2021 season.

25981143,"PITTSBURGH -- Antonio Brown wants out.
No more Photoshopped images of him in a San Francisco 49ers jersey or a FaceTime session with Jerry Rice to send his message. Brown was blunt Tuesday in a farewell social media video thanking Steelers fans for nine years, along with the hashtag #NewDemands.
Wide receiver Antonio Brown has asked the Steelers for a trade, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Trouble between the Steelers and Antonio Brown has been ""brewing for years,"" and a once-unthinkable split is now possible. Here's how they got here.
This has bubbled for awhile. Brown has been unhappy, and agent Drew Rosenhaus told the Steelers of Brown's position in late January.
As long as the Steelers get adequate draft capital for Brown, the All-Pro has played his last down as a Steeler. It's over. Let's leave the slightest wiggle room for an unprompted hug-it-out session, but that's unlikely now.
Since everyone's pretty clear on how things got here, let's take a hard look at what's next.
Most likely a first-round pick. That might be difficult with Brown's antics and off-field legal issues, but the team believes Brown is too good not to get high-end capital.
""They will want a 1,"" an NFL general manager said.
Brown's palatable salaries of $12.625 million next season, $11.3 million in 2020 and $12.5 million in 2021 could entice teams to make a stronger offer -- unless Brown wants to negotiate a new deal, though he may not have much power in that case.
This answer will crystallize at the NFL scouting combine later this month, but two high-ranking NFL execs say if trading for Brown, they probably would give up a Day 2 pick (second or third round) for his services. One said that could fall to a fourth-round pick, depending on what's discovered in the process.
Considering the cultural cost of keeping Brown on the roster, a Day 2 pick would have to get the job done if it's the best offer.
Between March 13-16 is a good starting point. A trade can't be executed until the start of the new league year March 13. And of course there's Brown's $2.5 million signing bonus due March 17.
If they don't want to pay that money or endure the headache of keeping Brown on the roster, then that is the window.
But two teams can always agree to a trade in principle before March 13. That was the case with the Kansas City Chiefs and Washington Redskins in the Alex Smith trade last year.
Darren Woodson questions Steelers WR Antonio Brown's trade request because he can't think of a better situation for AB.
The Steelers would absorb $21.12 million in dead money by trading Brown. Luckily for the Steelers, Brown's cap hit of $22.165 million would go off the books and essentially offset the dead money.
If Brown is on the roster after March 17, not only do the Steelers pay him, but the amount also hits their salary cap.
But here's a creative accounting option for the Steelers, via ESPN's Dan Graziano: Trading Brown after June 1 allows the Steelers to spread the cap hit over multiple years. They'd be keeping a disgruntled player on the roster well into the offseason program but could create more than $10 million in immediate cap relief.
The Steelers would be quite stubborn to dig in on this method. And the proverbial distraction wouldn't dissipate anytime soon.
Cue the crying emoji. Players of Brown's caliber are not replaced. Rather, the Steelers will retool the offense this offseason and rely on a more balanced attack led by JuJu Smith-Schuster.
It's wild to think the Steelers are losing two top-10 players in their prime in the same offseason, but here we are with Brown and Le'Veon Bell.
The Steelers have a chance in every game with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who led the league in passing last year with 5,129 yards. They will expect a sizable jump from James Washington in his second season. James Conner and Jaylen Samuels will hold down the running game. Tight end Vance McDonald's role will expand. Then, the Steelers can use a draft pick from the Brown trade to land a playmaker.
The free agency crop of receivers is not packed with star power, but they could comb for potential deals on a deep threat such as John Brown or a steady all-around player such as Randall Cobb or Tyrell Williams.
That's easy -- he's expected to be the Steelers' No. 1 option. The next step in Smith-Schuster's evolution is showing he can beat top corners without Brown drawing attention.
He sounds ready.
""It's a responsibility every receiver loves to have,""  Smith-Schuster said at the Pro Bowl.

25933140,"""We thank Robert for all that he brought to the team during his six seasons in Atlanta,"" general manager Thomas Dimitroff said in a statement. ""He was a significant contributor to our defense and we have a great deal of respect for him. We wish Robert all the best going forward.""
Alford thanked the team in a tweet.
Thank you Atlanta for 6 incredible seasons. Sucks that it ended on this note. I enjoyed playing in this incredible city. Ima miss my dawgs but I'm excited for the next chapter. #TAT
Alford, a second-round draft pick in 2013, had two years and $17 million left on his contract. He signed a four-year, $38 million extension ($21 million guaranteed) in December of 2016. Releasing Alford provides a $7.9 million savings against the 2019 salary cap.
The Falcons appeared destined to part ways with Alford after he struggled in coverage and with penalties during the 2018 season. Despite those issues, Alford expressed confidence in his ability, saying an early-season ankle injury affected his performance at right corner.
""I feel like I'm top 10 [cornerback] in this league,"" Alford told ESPN in December. ""Last year, I was doing my thing. Came into this year, I did my thing. At the end of the day, I just have to get back to my style of play and make those plays that the team needs me to make that I've been making in the past.
""I haven't made those plays this season, but we have [two] games left. All I have to do is show my worth and go out there and ball my tail off.""
In the end, the Falcons told Alford it was time to move in another direction.
Alford started 76 of 88 games with the Falcons, playing 4,904 defensive snaps. He finished his Falcons stint with 291 tackles, 10 interceptions, 59 pass breakups and two defensive touchdowns. Alford probably was best known for intercepting New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in Super Bowl LI and returning the interception 82 yards for a touchdown.
With Alford gone from the starting lineup, the Falcons are likely to look to 2018 second-round pick Isaiah Oliver in a starting role next season. Oliver saw some valuable playing time late in the 2018 season, rotating in for both Alford and starting left cornerback Desmond Trufant.
The Falcons seem likely to stick with Trufant, who still has four years and $44.75 million remaining on his contract. Drafting a cornerback doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility, either, as the Falcons try to fix the defense with head coach Dan Quinn taking over as defensive coordinator. Quinn fired defensive coordinator Marquand Manuel.
The Falcons' secondary is expected to be much improved next season with the return of Pro Bowl strong safety Keanu Neal (ACL) and free safety Ricardo Allen (Achilles) from season-ending injuries.

25921740,"At the end of a dour Super Bowl in Atlanta only a mother could love, it really shouldn't have been a surprise that Bill Belichick was the one standing triumphant.
Last year, Tom Brady produced what was arguably the greatest single performance in Super Bowl history, only for Belichick's defense to get run over by Eagles backup Nick Foles. On Sunday, with Brady struggling en route to his worst passing performance in a title game, Belichick's defense saved the day. The Patriots delivered Belichick's masterpiece in their 13-3 win over the Rams.
What we saw from the Patriots on Sunday night was the best defensive performance we have ever seen in a Super Bowl.
I don't say that as hyperbole. To start, the only other time a team has allowed just three points in the Super Bowl was when the Cowboys defeated the Dolphins 24-3 in 1971. Those Dolphins scored 22.5 points per game during the regular season, while Sean McVay's Rams were up at 32.9 points per contest. The Pats allowed the Rams just 9.1 percent of their scoring average, the best mark in Super Bowl history:
You might argue that we're rewarding the Patriots for not allowing a late garbage-time score, as was the case when the 1985 Pats scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter to shorten Chicago's lead to 44-10 in Super Bowl XX. That's true. The other side of the coin, though, is that the Patriots' defense couldn't simply pin its ears back and rush the quarterback all game. They weren't up against Steve Grogan.
They had to come up with stops drive after drive to win against the Rams, who were the second-best offense in the second-highest scoring season in NFL history. Scoring 13 points against the Rams, as the Patriots did Sunday, would have earned a team a 1-17 record against the Rams in the 2018 season. The only time Los Angeles failed to hit 13 points was when the Bears held them to six in Week 14, but Chicago was the much-celebrated best defense in football. The Patriots ranked 16th in defensive DVOA and had just allowed 31 points in the second half to the Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game.
McVay, who admitted after the game that he ""simply got outcoached,"" never found a solution. His offense slowly suffocated throughout the game. The same Rams team that bragged about its physicality after running all over the Cowboys in the divisional round produced just two first downs on 18 rushing attempts. Jared Goff and the Los Angeles passing attack averaged just 4.7 yards per dropback, with an unsung Patriots pass rush sacking Goff four times and knocking him down on 12 occasions. An offense that made it to the red zone a league-high 80 times during the regular season failed to make it inside the Patriots' 20-yard line even once Sunday.
To me, it topped the two most famous Belichick game plans of all time. The 2001 Greatest Show on Turf Rams managed to score 17 points and rack up 26 first downs on the Patriots, who won Super Bowl XXXVI thanks to big plays. Ty Law took an errant Kurt Warner throw to the house for a pick-six. The Pats recovered a Ricky Proehl fumble at midfield and scored their lone offensive touchdown before halftime. Jeff Wilkins missed a 52-yard field goal in the first half, and the Rams had five drives that went to or past the 50-yard line that resulted in zero points. This defensive performance was more consistently dominant.

Belichick's game plan as the Giants' defensive coordinator against the Bills in Super Bowl XXV resides in the Hall of Fame, but again, this showing should join it. Belichick sacrificed his run defense to stifle Jim Kelly, and Thurman Thomas subsequently ran for 135 yards and a touchdown. The Bills still managed to get into position for a 47-yard field goal that would have won the game, only for Scott Norwood to push his kick wide in a 20-19 nailbiter.
Those performances were legendary, but the win in Super Bowl LIII surpasses them in the pantheon of brilliant defensive game plans from Belichick, with credit also going to defensive coordinator and future Dolphins coach Brian Flores. So, how did the Patriots pull it off?

The play that won the game
You might note that one of the coaches in that subhead isn't on the Patriots' payroll anymore. ""We had to put together something that would neutralize the running game and their big play-action passes on early downs,"" Bill Belichick said to ESPN's Steve Young after the game. ""We felt like if we could make them drive it and earn it, similar to what the Lions did to them,"" he added, ""... we would have a chance to get them off the field on third down.""
The future of football might be offense, but Bill Belichick showed on Sunday night that while he's still coaching defense isn't dead yet.
Super Bowl LIII is in the books, but we're already on to the 2019 season. Who is at the top of our projection? Here's how our experts have the league stacked.
You might not like it, but you're watching the greatest dynasty in sports history. And it's time to appreciate it, whether or not you root for the Pats.
What Belichick said shouldn't be a surprise. If you read my preview on the game, I suggested that the Patriots were going to focus on stopping the outside zone and taking away play-action, just as Lions head coach (and former Patriots defensive coordinator) Matt Patricia emphasized in Week 13 against the Rams. Goff finished 5-of-9 for 68 yards on play-action passes, with Belichick forcing him to try to win the Super Bowl as a conventional dropback passer.
Where I was surprised, though, was with how the Patriots built their coverages. The Lions played more zone against the Rams than they had in their prior games, particularly by using more quarters (or Cover 4) shells. I figured that the Patriots, who have much better cornerbacks than Detroit, would still rely heavily on man coverage to try to stop the Rams and their endless series of stacks and bunches.
I was wrong. As McVay noted after the game, the Patriots played plenty of zone coverage throughout the game, including quarters looks on early downs. Quarters helped the Patriots keep the intentions and depths of their safeties disguised before the snaps, while simultaneously allowing New England to flood the box with defenders to stop the run. The Pats used what amounted to a 5-1 over front with Patrick Chung as a strongside linebacker to try to penetrate into the backfield against outside zone. Here's a play -- animation courtesy of NFL Next Gen Stats -- where we see both the over front and quarters coverage behind, with Dont'a Hightower dropping into coverage and knocking away the dig route to Josh Reynolds:
Things got more complicated when Chung went down with an arm injury in the third quarter, which cost the Patriots both a veteran communicator and a versatile starting safety. Duron Harmon took Chung's place, and the Patriots subsequently were forced to play more conservative coverage concepts. When they did play man, the Pats again surprised by generally sticking Stephon Gilmore one-on-one against Brandin Cooks, with Robert Woods doubled by Jonathan Jones and a safety.
On third down, the Patriots tormented Goff and McVay with stunts and twists to throw off their pass blocking while preventing Goff, McVay and center John Sullivan from diagnosing where pressure was going to come from before the snap. Teams that load up on twists often struggle to keep contain or leave an obvious running lane open for the opposing quarterback, but the Patriots did an excellent job of getting pressure against the interior of the Rams' line (particularly guard Austin Blythe) while simultaneously closing down Goff when he bootlegged out of the pocket. Goff was 2-of-3 passing for 2 yards and two sacks when he waggled to the sidelines.
Overall, the Patriots were wildly productive when they threw extra defensive backs on the field. According to the NFL's Next Gen Stats, the Pats posted a 45 percent success rate on defense with four or five defensive backs on the field. Their dime package, though, had a dominant game. On 20 snaps, the Pats racked up three sacks and held Goff to a dismal line: 6-of-16 for 60 yards and an interception. Fifteen of those 20 snaps were regarded as successful plays for the Patriots' defense in terms of keeping the Rams from getting on schedule, good for a 75 percent success rate.
McVay took the blame after the loss for not adapting or adjusting his playcalling, and you can certainly wonder whether the Rams should have tried different things. It seems like they could have used late motion before the snap to try to take advantage of a static Patriots defense and thrown bubble screens to try to gain a numbers advantage and/or force the Pats out of quarters. The Falcons, who shared some similarities under Kyle Shanahan to these Rams in terms of their outside zone emphasis, had success running the crack toss against the Patriots in the Super Bowl, and the Rams could have used that to set up screens.
At some point, the Rams might have been better off force-feeding Todd Gurley II; they ran the ball just once on 20 snaps against the Pats' dime personnel grouping, which New England was comfortable running on first-and-10 and third-and-2. The Rams went with 11 personnel on more than 78 percent of their dropbacks, but for the second week in a row, they were more effective getting a second tight end on the field with 12 personnel. The Rams posted a 40 percent success rate with their traditional three-wideout set, but that jumped to 54 percent with Gerald Everett and Tyler Higbee on the field.
The Rams eventually got some offense going in the third quarter. Goff made two great throws, including a picture-perfect 18-yard pass to Woods on third-and-7, to get into field goal range. The Rams got their one big chance of the game when the Patriots badly blew a coverage and left Cooks wide open running up the seam on a Yankee concept, only for Goff to belatedly recognize his good fortune and give Jason McCourty, who played every snap on Sunday, enough time to find work and knock away the pass.
A beautiful Pats pass rush subsequently limited the Rams to a field goal when Hightower got inside Blythe for a sack. It was a critical play, given that Goff wasn't able to find a wide-open C.J. Anderson for a checkdown that would have moved the chains:
The Rams had to punt on their next drive after a questionable holding call on Sullivan wiped out a 13-yard Gurley run, but after the Patriots scored a touchdown, the Rams drove down the field with a screen to Cooks and a pick play that freed up Reynolds to convert third-and-9 over the middle. On the next play, Goff dropped a perfect ball over Gilmore for what could have been a touchdown pass to Cooks, only for Harmon to jar the ball loose with a hit.
On the next play, Flores dared Goff to do it again by sending a six-man blitz against six Rams blockers with Hightower as an underneath robber and the four defensive backs in quarters behind. A panicked Goff rushed his dropback and made another throw toward Cooks, but while Goff's pass needed to be deep and toward the sideline to give Cooks a chance, his throw was badly short and amounted to a fair catch for Gilmore.

It's worth noting that Belichick and Flores didn't pull this off with a bunch of superstars in their prime outside of Gilmore, who had an inconsistent game before his interception. Hightower, Trey Flowers and Devin McCourty are homegrown talents, but Belichick the executive has also found useful talent on the cheap. Jason McCourty was acquired for a swap of sixth- and seventh-round picks when the Browns were about to cut him. Kyle Van Noy, who had a monster game with a sack and three knockdowns, was the product of a nearly identical swap with the Lions. Jones and J.C. Jackson were undrafted free agents. There was no Lawrence Taylor or Ty Law on the field for the Pats. No matter. This was the signature defensive performance from the greatest defensive coach in the history of football.
Of course, the guy on the opposite sideline nearly had his own signature performance. Rams defensive coordinator Wade Phillips dialed up a brilliant game plan, as Aaron Donald & Co. flummoxed Brady for most of the game. The nonexistent folks who supposedly were counting out Brady throughout the season nearly got to raise their straw hands in the air and celebrate their victory, only for the Rams' pass rush to finally tire just as Josh McDaniels found a way to unlock the defense.
As Tony Romo described on the CBS broadcast, Phillips did an excellent job of building his coverages to show man coverage to Brady before the snap before playing like zone afterward, or vice versa. It's difficult to confuse Brady at age 41, but he was absolutely flummoxed on a number of snaps. One trick came on the interception that ended the opening drive, when Brady read man coverage before the snap, then found out just as he threw that the Rams were in zone and playing a form of trap coverage, with Aqib Talib over the top and Nickell Robey-Coleman underneath. The slot corner broke outside on the throw to Chris Hogan and tipped away the ball, with Cory Littleton catching the tip for an interception.
During the first half, Brady simply didn't look comfortable with the pressure or looks he saw, especially on third downs. The Pats ran the ball on third-and-8 to set up Stephen Gostkowski's missed field goal. Brady threw away a third-and-5 pass under pressure from Donald. Early checkdowns to Gronkowski and James White didn't give those receivers much of a chance of turning upfield for a first down. Cordarrelle Patterson came up a yard short of the sticks on third-and-10, and when the Pats went for it on fourth-and-1, excellent coverage from the Rams forced Brady to try to hit an impossible window to a diving Gronk.
The one thing the Patriots did have working in the first half was Julian Edelman. My preview identified covering the slot as the biggest point of weakness for the Rams before the game, and for much of this contest, it ended up as their only point of weakness. The Rams surprisingly started the game with Talib traveling across the formation and into the slot to cover Edelman, but Edelman eventually just went over to Talib's side of the field and tortured him out of a reduced split. In the first half, Brady was 7-of-8 for 93 yards on throws to Edelman (with the one incompletion essentially an uncatchable throwaway) and 8-of-17 for 67 yards throwing to everyone else.

The Rams eventually started moving Marcus Peters around the formation to try to cover Edelman, and while he got away with a couple of holding or illegal contact calls, it was a better solution than Talib. The Pats tried to target Peters' propensity for jumping routes with fades and his struggles tackling by isolating him in space, but the former Chiefs star generally held his own on deeper throws. With Donald & Co. getting steady pressure on Brady, the Patriots had six drives in the first half break into Los Angeles' side of the field with only three points to show for it.
The eventual breakthrough for the Patriots came with another concept I wrote about extensively in my preview: using James Develin to dictate mismatches in the slot against Los Angeles' base defense. The Pats came out in their 21 personnel (2 RBs, 2 WRs, 1 TE) with Edelman in the slot on the first play of the game and got a 13-yard run out of Sony Michel for a first down, but the run defense that swallowed up the Cowboys and Saints showed up and bullied the Patriots at the line of scrimmage for most of this one.
The game-winning drive, though, required McDaniels to get even heavier. He dialed up a creative play-action look to start the drive out of 21 personnel, with Gronkowski blocking for a moment before turning upfield on a wheel route past a leveraged Samson Ebukam for a first down.
The Pats then brought in Dwayne Allen and ran three consecutive plays out of 22 personnel, with two backs and two tight ends on the field. On each of the plays, they split out wide Develin and a halfback (either Michel or Rex Burkhead), where they were covered by Peters and Talib, L.A.'s two best cover corners. That left Gronkowski, Allen and Edelman matched up on the interior against linebackers and safeties and allowed the Patriots to run one of their favorite plays.
Hoss Y-Juke has been a staple of the Patriots going back through the early days of this dynasty, so it's not exactly a secret that Phillips wouldn't have been prepared to see. You can see a breakdown of Hoss Y-Juke here, but it's remarkably simple. The ""Hoss"" call means you're getting hitch routes from the outside receivers, while the slot receivers run seam routes. Y-Juke calls for the third receiver from the outside, who is almost always Edelman, to run an option route against an overmatched linebacker.
The Patriots ran Hoss Y-Juke three times in a row. The Rams stayed in their base defense all three times, and the Patriots ripped them apart. On the first of the three plays, with Edelman matched up in the slot against Littleton, he ran the juke route for 13 yards and a first down.
The Patriots came back to the line and motioned out Burkhead before throwing him a hitch against Peters for 7 yards. On the third snap, the Rams must have known what was coming, but it didn't matter. They tried to disguise where their five-man pressure was coming from by sending Littleton toward Gronk in coverage at the snap, but Brady lofted in a perfect pass for a 29-yard catch. One play later, Michel plunged in for the only touchdown of the game.
It takes a unique set of circumstances for Hoss Y-Juke to thrive, but it's the perfect play for the Patriots. You need running backs who are viable threats to catch the ball. You need tight ends with the athleticism to stretch the field vertically and make plays out of the slot. You also need a quarterback capable of making a smart decision quickly out of an empty backfield.
I'm surprised the Patriots didn't motion Develin out wide more frequently. One first-half snap with him split out yielded a rep for Edelman in the slot against Ebukam and an easy completion, although two other short throws were quickly closed down or dropped. The Patriots did rack up 67 yards on 15 rushing attempts out of 21 personnel before the fourth quarter, so the running game with Develin in had been competent. It's possible that the Patriots didn't think Brady would have enough time to make his reads and get the ball out in an empty set before the Rams' pass rush tired, and indeed, Donald & Co. didn't deter the Pats from running Hoss Y-Juke three times in a row.
After the Gilmore interception, the Pats took over with 4:17 left and a chance to seal the game. The Rams had a reputation during the season for indiscipline within their run defense in an attempt to make plays, and while they were structurally sound for the vast majority of the Super Bowl, they finally cracked.
On the second play, Ndamukong Suh fired across the face of a guard to make a play but ran himself out of the action. The Pats briefly doubled Donald, moved him off the ball, and ran right into his gap, with a pulling Joe Thuney kicking out Mark Barron. Marcus Cannon essentially helped block three Rams, as he chipped Donald, blocked Littleton at the second level, and shielded an overly aggressive John Johnson in the process. Michel rode this beautiful blocking for a 26-yard gain.
Three plays later, it was Develin's turn. The Pats brought in Burkhead and ran directly at Dante Fowler Jr., who tried to stunt inside and was subsequently helped into the trash by Trent Brown. Lamarcus Joyner came down from safety and got into a three-point stance before blitzing into the backfield at the snap, but a motioning Gronkowski dispatched him with ease. The Rams scraped Barron over the top to try to seal the edge, but Develin laid him out at the point of attack. Talib was the unblocked defender, but Burkhead's cutback and the aftermath of Develin's ferocious block took the cornerback totally out of the play. The former Bengals backup cut upfield and outran Robey-Coleman before Peters made a touchdown-saving tackle. The 26-yard run put the Patriots in field goal range, and while they failed to convert a subsequent third-and-1, Gostkowski hit a 41-yarder to start the celebrations for a sixth time in New England.

25979956,"New Cincinnati Bengals coach Zac Taylor has hired local high school coach Doug Rosfeld as an assistant.
Offensive line coach Jim Turner is returning to the NFL with the Bengals, his first coaching job in the league since he was fired in 2014 as a result of the Dolphins' bullying scandal.
Grantham interviewed with the Bengals on Tuesday and then met with Bengals owner Mike Brown on Wednesday morning. Sources told ESPN that a major factor in Grantham's decision to stay revolved around his family.
The Athletic first reported that the Bengals had formally requested permission to interview Grantham and that he was at the top of first-year Bengals head coach Zac Taylor's list.
Grantham, 52, has been with Dan Mullen the past two seasons, 2018 at Florida and 2017 at Mississippi State. His Florida defense last season ranked first in the SEC in turnovers forced (26). In Grantham's only season at Florida, the Gators finished 20th nationally in scoring defense, an improvement from 69th the year before.
Grantham previously coached in the NFL from 1999 to 2009 and was the Cleveland Browns' defensive coordinator from 2005 to '07. He returned to the college ranks in 2010 as Georgia's defensive coordinator. Grantham's defenses are predicated on pressure, and he's renowned for bringing blitzers from different angles and different positions.
The coaches Grantham has worked under during his career include Nick Saban, Frank Beamer, Mark Richt, Bobby Petrino, Dom Capers and Romeo Crennel. Last May, Grantham received a three-year contract extension worth $4.5 million, making him the highest-paid assistant coach in Florida history.

25938078,"The Dolphins are hiring Patriots receivers coach Chad O'Shea as offensive coordinator and former NFL receiver Tiquan Underwood as offensive quality control coach, sources told ESPN's Field Yates.
O'Shea had been with the Patriots since 2009 and spent 10 years as Flores' colleague in New England. O'Shea was a candidate to fill the Patriots' offensive coordinator position when it looked like Josh McDaniels would leave to become the Indianapolis Colts head coach last offseason. Instead, McDaniels and O'Shea returned to New England in their previous roles for a Super Bowl LIII run.
The Dolphins haven't closed the door on Ryan Tannehill's return, but they certainly will be open to drafting a quarterback this spring.
So long, 2018 season. It's never too early to look ahead to 2019. Our crew of insiders weighs in on the biggest topics of the offseason.
In recent years, O'Shea earned a role running the Patriots' red-zone offense. He was given the opportunity to call plays during preseason games. O'Shea also has extensive experience coaching special teams. He was a college quarterback at Marshall and the University of Houston.
This will be the first offensive coordinator job for O'Shea, who will have help from veteran coaches on the staff. Jim Caldwell, who has had two stints as an NFL head coach and a history of getting a lot out of his quarterbacks, is expected to join the Dolphins staff and help him.
One of O'Shea's biggest supporters is Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman, whom O'Shea helped mold from a college quarterback and a seventh-round pick into one of the NFL's best slot receivers.
Underwood spent five seasons as an NFL receiver, including in 2011 with the Patriots. He was memorably released one night before Super Bowl XLVI. Underwood was the receivers coach at the University of Lafayette in 2018.
The Dolphins have a big question mark at quarterback, with the team expected to move on from longtime starter Ryan Tannehill this offseason. Dolphins general manager Chris Grier said Monday that they are open to falling in love with a quarterback in the 2019 NFL draft. They have the No. 13 pick in April's draft.

25900439,"It's not quite the NFL, and it's not quite college football, either. It's being billed as a developmental league that is trying to be an augmentation to the NFL season, according to league co-founder Bill Polian, with a bunch of things that will look the same and some that will look markedly different from the football to which you are accustomed.
With a 10-game regular-season schedule, the inaugural campaign will culminate in an April 27 championship game. You probably have a lot of questions about the AAF -- its teams, players, rules and more -- so here's our primer on all the big topics:
A combination of places: online, on broadcast networks, on cable and potentially on your phone. CBS will broadcast the two opening-night games (most of the country will see San Diego at San Antonio while some will get Atlanta at Orlando) and CBS Sports Network will televise one game a week. NFL Network will show 19 games -- starting with Salt Lake at Arizona in Week 1 and then two games per week following. TNT will have Salt Lake at Birmingham in Week 2 and then B-R Live will stream one game per week over the final eight weeks of the season.
The Head Ball Coach is back, this time as the star attraction for the Orlando Apollos. And while it may be a new league, it's going to be the same high-flying offense he's known for.
The Alliance of American Football has a 2019 launch date, a TV contract, an eight-city blueprint and a vision for a league alongside the NFL.
The thought is that this could be comparable to what would happen if backups on NFL teams played against each other. Multiple players, coaches and Polian himself said they believe their starters could be competitive with the ""twos"" in the league.
""What I want the fans to say is that it's real professional football,"" Polian said.
There will be familiar faces, primarily at quarterback, with Christian Hackenberg, Matt Simms and Aaron Murray. Trent Richardson, Matt Asiata, Bishop Sankey and Denard Robinson are running backs with NFL experience, and Scooby Wright and Sterling Moore are defensive players who have name recognition.
The majority of ""names"" are the coaches: Dennis Erickson (Salt Lake), Steve Spurrier (Orlando), Mike Martz (San Diego), Mike Singletary (Memphis) and Mike Riley (San Antonio).
There are several significant ones:
The most notable one is no kickoffs, which is something Polian insisted on if he was going to be involved. They did this because data they collected said the kickoff was largely a non-dynamic play where the largest number of injuries occurred. Also, fans and players dislike the kickoff on the whole, and it affects overall game time. Instead, the ball starts on the 25-yard line after each score or at the start of the game.
Instead of an onside kick, if a team is trailing by 17 points or there's five minutes or less left in the fourth quarter, a team can attempt an onside conversion. They get the ball on their own 28-yard line and have to convert a fourth-and-12. If they do, they keep the ball and keep going. Don't convert, and the opponent takes over from the point at which they stop them.
There are no extra point kicks, so a team is going for two after every touchdown.
Overtime rules have the ball starting on the 10-yard line with four downs and a two-point extra point if a team scores (field goals are not allowed).
There's also a significant change in pass-rushing rules for defenses. Teams can rush only five players and can't blitz players from the secondary. If you have five men on the line of scrimmage on defense, those are the only players who can rush. ""With less than a month to get our teams ready to play, the hardest part to get cohesiveness in is the offensive line,"" Polian said. ""So if we came with all the exotic blitzes that we see, which is basically coming out of the secondary, they couldn't pick it up and we're going to get quarterbacks hurt, and it's not much of a game, honestly. Nobody wants to see the quarterback sacked repeatedly.""
With replays, officials won't have to go under the hood or watch a tablet. Instead, the official will have an earpiece to communicate directly on the field with the replay official in real time. All of this is designed to help shorten game times. The hope is for games to be two and a half hours or less.
There will be fantasy games to play through the app. You can't gamble through the app, but MGM is the ""gaming partner"" of the AAF -- and the thought is there will be a plethora of options both on the app and through the gaming partner to make the game more interactive. Charlie Ebersol, the other co-founder, explained the league has been building technology to give real-time data from hardware they've developed that will allow for actual real-time updates and gaming possibilities.

‚Ä¢  Watch: Manning on Jared Goff ¬ª
‚Ä¢  More episodes on ESPN+: Full series ¬ª
""In regular fantasy, you're the team owner. In daily fantasy, you are the general manager. We believe in the game we have, you're the coach,"" Ebersol said. ""So think of it like, instead of a fantasy manager, you're a fantasy coach. So you're going play to play, and you're looking at the predictability of what play is going to happen and which players are going to be involved and what the odds of those plays happening are. That's more of what our game is.""
That data, Ebersol hopes, also will give more of an objective view of how players are performing. Every player and every ball used in a game will have microchips embedded to accumulate and transmit data.
The league exists in eight cities in the South, Southwest and West Coast -- mostly with cities that could make sense for NFL franchises (Birmingham, San Antonio, Salt Lake City, Orlando, Memphis, San Diego) as well as two existing NFL locales (Atlanta and Arizona). Ticket packages are $75 for five home games. For the most part, games are being played in college stadiums.
Three ways. First, the league figured out the top 30 NFL-producing colleges over the past 10 seasons (USC is No. 1), and gave each team three high-producing schools. Then they gave teams up to 30 other area schools in a certain range to pull allocations from.
If a player doesn't fit that grouping, they also assigned four NFL teams to each AAF team; if a player played for a team or was in training camp with a team, then his rights were given to the respective AAF team. This was done with both geographic and population data (for instance, San Antonio has the Cowboys, Texans, Chiefs and Eagles).
There is also at least one CFL team assigned to each team. If a player hits none of these lists, then there was a first-come, first-served rights list of 25 players. If multiple teams put in a request for the same player, they went by their waiver list.
""We may tweak it depending on what we see, but the concept is good,"" Polian said. ""We know the concept is good, because it's working.""
That placed Richardson on Birmingham, Murray on Atlanta and Asiata on Salt Lake City, for example.
The league didn't give out much in terms of financial deals, but the players all signed three-year, $250,000 contracts. Every player is on the same deal. If they finish a year in the league, they'll also get a stipend for secondary education. There's also an internship program. Contracts also have bonuses tied into them depending on hitting both on- and off-field incentives.
Polian and Ebersol want to work to be a complement to the NFL, and Polian said he's open to suggestions from the league. As for what they are hoping for by the end of this season?
""I want folks who know football to say, 'Hey, this is pretty good football and it'll get better and it got better during the year,'"" Polian said. ""We're going to be a lot better on the 27th of April than we'll be on the 9th of February. Teams get better as they practice and play together. That's No. 1.
""No. 2, I want people to say that it's an interesting and exciting game.""

25973632,"Rizzi, 48, worked for three different head coaches during an impressive 10-year run in Miami. He interviewed for the Dolphins' head-coaching job last month before the organization decided to hire Brian Flores instead.
The Saints, meanwhile, decided to move on from their trio of special-teams coaches -- veteran Mike Westhoff, Bradford Banta and Kevin O'Dea -- despite New Orleans' improvement in many areas after coaxing Westhoff out of retirement as a midseason replacement in 2017.
Westhoff, who turned 71 last month, recently told NOLA.com that he had not decided yet whether he was going to come back in 2019. He now plans to retire and was ""surprised and very disappointed"" that the Saints decided to fire Banta and let O'Dea's contract expire.
Westhoff was considered a pioneer in the special-teams game during his long stints with the Dolphins and New York Jets from 1986 to 2012 before he retired the first time.
The Saints have one of the NFL's best punters, Thomas Morstead, and one of the best kickers, Wil Lutz -- and they led the league in net punting average in 2019 while allowing a total of just 60 punt-return yards. They also turned backup quarterback Taysom Hill into a special-teams star over the past two years, which included a blocked punt, a 47-yard kickoff return and three successful fake punts in 2018.
However, the Saints' return units have been just average, with none longer than 50 yards and no return touchdowns this past season. They finished on a low note by allowing a fake punt to turn the tide of their NFC Championship Game loss to the Los Angeles Rams.
It's also likely that the Saints wanted to pounce on a standout coach like Rizzi once he became available.
Rizzi began his tenure in Miami while current Saints assistant general manager Jeff Ireland was the Dolphins' GM. He also worked under current Saints assistant head coach/tight ends coach Dan Campbell when Campbell was Miami's interim head coach during the 2015 season. Rizzi also held the title of assistant head coach or associate head coach with the Dolphins over the past four years.
Among other highlights, the Dolphins led the NFL with 10 blocked punts over the past eight years. And they ranked fourth in 2018 in longtime NFL writer Rick Gosselin's annual special-teams rankings (the Saints ranked second).
Before joining the Dolphins' staff in 2009, Rizzi served as a head coach at the University of Rhode Island and the University of New Haven, among other college jobs.

Scan through all 32 teams by division, or click here to jump ahead to your team:


The Bills trade down and make two first-round draft picks. 
At No. 9, Buffalo could be an enticing trade partner for a team seeking a quarterback or looking to nab a top-tier defensive lineman who is slipping down the board. If the Bills decide to pass up the best player available, their No. 9 selection (worth 1,350 points) is worth roughly the same as the Raiders' Nos. 24 and 27 picks (1,420) on the traditional trade-value chart. General manager Brandon Beane said at the Senior Bowl the Bills don't need to be in the top 10, so expect Buffalo to discuss trading down.-- Mike Rodak
Can the Giants get their QB of the future? Or will another QB-hungry team take Ohio State's signal-caller? Todd McShay goes 1-32 in this year's draft.
When might Le'Veon Bell sign with a new team? Which rules are set for a makeover? What happens next with replay? Here's an in-depth look at the offseason.
What's in store this offseason? Nick Foles and Le'Veon Bell head south, Antonio Brown moves west, and Browns fans make playoff plans.

Miami releases QB Ryan Tannehill and replaces him with a rookie. 
Tannehill's time with the Dolphins is coming to an end and the easy fix would be to trade for or sign Nick Foles, Joe Flacco or Teddy Bridgewater. Instead, Dolphins GM Chris Grier passes on that option, falls in love with a quarterback in the 2019 draft and selects him with the intention of being the starter. Kyler Murray would make a lot of sense in that situation given that Miami loved Baker Mayfield last year. -- Cameron Wolfe
The Patriots load up at receiver.

Similar to 2007, when they traded for Randy Moss and Wes Welker, New England will bring in a few receivers following a season in which they were limited at the position. Whether that's early in the draft, in free agency or via trade, the cupboard will be well-stocked.-- Mike Reiss

The Jets miss out on Le'Veon Bell in free agency, but ...
... rebound by signing Tevin Coleman as part of a backfield overhaul. They will cut Isaiah Crowell, a mediocre free-agent signing from last year, and say goodbye to Bilal Powell, 30, their longest-tenured player who hits free agency. They will go into the season with Coleman, Elijah McGuire and Trenton Cannon as their top three backs. -- Rich Cimini

The Ravens sign Mark Ingram in free agency. 
Baltimore has done its best with patchwork at running back over the past four seasons -- from Justin Forsett to Terrance West to Alex Collins to Gus Edwards -- but the team needs a proven featured back in building an offense around Lamar Jackson. Under offensive coordinator Greg Roman, veteran runners such as Frank Gore and LeSean McCoy have thrived. Ingram is the type of durable, physical and efficient back (4.5-yard career average) who would be the perfect fit in Baltimore's offense. -- Jamison Hensley

The Bengals shake up the linebacking corps, and that could mean parting ways with Vontaze Burfict. 
The linebackers were a disaster in 2018. The three starting linebackers at the beginning of the season never played together due to suspensions and injuries. The biggest question mark is Burfict, who hasn't played a full season in years and has sustained an alarming number of concussions. With a new coaching staff in place, it makes sense that the Bengals might move on from Burfict and look to draft a linebacker. -- Katherine Terrell
Dan Graziano explains why he likes Cleveland to come out on top in the AFC North in the 2019 season.

The Browns release linebacker Jamie Collins.
Collins has been good with the Browns, but his contract pays him to be great. He has not hit that level, and he's due to be paid $22 million in salary the next two seasons. Cutting him would cost the Browns only $2.5 million under the 2019 salary cap, and give Cleveland $9.25 million in salary-cap room. -- Pat McManamon

The Steelers trade Antonio Brown as soon as possible after seriously contemplating releasing him outright. 
Trading Brown for a high draft pick is the prudent move, but a deal can't be finalized until March 13, and the team might be ready to move on now after news of a domestic dispute surfaced this week. Releasing him with a post-June 1 designation would save around $15 million in salary-cap space. That's awfully tempting for an organization that needs to reset its standard for tolerance after Brown's repeated struggles. -- Jeremy Fowler

Le'Veon Bell calls Houston home in 2019.
The Texans have a Pro Bowl quarterback and receiver in Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins and a defense that's led by J.J. Watt. Bell, who didn't play a down for Pittsburgh in 2018, will elevate Houston's offense and allow Watt and the defense more time on the sideline while pushing the Colts for the top spot in the AFC South. -- Mike Wells

General manager Chris Ballard shakes the notion he won't spend big on free agents when he ... 
... uses some of the Colts' $120 million in salary-cap space to sign a pass-rusher to elevate Indy's defense. Who will that pass-rusher be? Kansas City's Dee Ford, Houston's Jadeveon Clowney and Dallas' DeMarcus Lawrence are the top free-agent pass-rushers. Ballard signs the one who doesn't get franchise-tagged. -- Mike Wells
Todd McShay has QB Dwayne Haskins going No. 6 to the Giants in his NFL Mock Draft 2.0, but can envision a team trading up to grab him earlier.

The Jaguars trade up to land their top quarterback in the draft. 
It would be out of character for the Jaguars to part with draft picks and be willing to pay the $25 million franchise-tag amount it would take to land Nick Foles, especially since they have $16.5 million in dead money with Blake Bortles. The Jaguars will sign a veteran quarterback and move up to ensure they land Dwayne Haskins. Tom Coughlin still believes in winning with the running game and defense (and the Patriots proved you can win a title that way), and that's how they will mitigate playing with a rookie QB.-- Mike DiRocco

Za'Darius Smith is reunited with Dean Pees in Tennessee.
The Titans are desperately in need of a veteran impact player to help improve their pass rush. Smith had 8.5 sacks, 25 QB hits and 10 tackles for loss for the Ravens last season. Pees was at Smith's pro day back in 2015 at Kentucky. The two still have a close relationship. Expect Smith to fetch a significant contract from the Titans and be their prize free-agent signing. -- Turron Davenport

The Broncos fill up the quarterback depth chart. 
Denver will dive into free agency for a quarterback, use a premium draft pick on a prospect and keep Case Keenum until it sorts out things for the season. The Broncos do not have a quarterback on their roster that they drafted, and their returning starter (Keenum) has one year left on his deal after a season when he looked somewhat overwhelmed. Missing on Paxton Lynch, a 2016 first-rounder Denver traded up to select, is a mistake that set back the Broncos for years as they kept waiting for him to come around and win the job. It's time to do with quarterback what they've done at other positions: commit the resources to pack it with potential starters and see who's got the moxie to win.-- Jeff Legwold

The Chiefs lose center Mitch Morse and cornerback Steven Nelson to free agency. 
Kansas City during last season re-signed two interior offensive linemen in Austin Reiter and Cam Erving to help prepare for Morse's departure. The Chiefs might have to choose between Nelson and their other starting cornerback, Kendall Fuller, whose contract is set to expire at the end of next season. -- Adam Teicher

The Chargers draft a quarterback.
Bolts GM Tom Telesco has not drafted a quarterback since selecting Brad Sorensen in the seventh round of the 2013 draft, his first year with the Chargers. Philip Rivers is perhaps the most durable quarterback in the NFL and is playing at a high level, but he's 37 years old and the Chargers need to start developing a young signal-caller to eventually replace him. -- Eric D. Williams

The Raiders make a legitimate run at Antonio Brown. 
You did say ""bold,"" right? What would be more bold than the ""Parts Unknown"" Raiders, who have four picks among the first 36 selections of the NFL draft and need a No. 1 wideout, going all-in for a totally known commodity in the temperamental All-Pro receiver? Jon Gruden loves veterans, and he might love Brown even more, calling the nine-year pro the ""hardest-working"" player he has ever seen in practice. ""I've seen Jerry Rice,"" Gruden said in December. ""I've seen a lot of good ones. But I put Antonio Brown at the top."" -- Paul Gutierrez

The Cowboys sign Dak Prescott to a long-term extension.
Maybe it's not so bold considering Jerry Jones has said all along Prescott is the Cowboys' quarterback of the future. But how about a six-year extension worth $168 million that includes $65 million in guarantees? Is that bold enough? Prescott has helped the Cowboys to the playoffs twice in his three seasons, played in the Pro Bowl twice in three years and has shown he has the moxie to handle difficult in-game situations when the team needs him most. -- Todd Archer
Max Kellerman states his case that if Nick Foles does find another team, the Giants and Vikings would be good destinations for him.

The Giants trade up to get quarterback Dwayne Haskins in the draft. 
Yes, they finally concede that the time has come to really find Eli Manning's successor, and are willing to do whatever is necessary to land their target. In this case, it's Haskins, the Ohio State signal-caller. The cost will be their first-round pick plus more draft capital, potentially a future first-round pick. GM Dave Gettleman watched in 2004 as Ernie Accorsi did whatever was necessary to get Manning. He does whatever is necessary to get the top QB in this draft. -- Jordan Raanan

The Eagles draft a defensive lineman in the first round this April. 
Executive VP of football operations Howie Roseman described this defensive-line draft class as ""historic,"" and with Brandon Graham heading into free agency and others like Chris Long and Michael Bennett in the twilight of their careers, Philly will be looking to replenish along the defensive front.-- Tim McManus

The Redskins lose linebacker Preston Smith and wide receiver Jamison Crowder to free agency. 
The Redskins have expressed a desire to retain both players. But there has been little movement toward re-signing either. Because of the importance of pass-rushers, Smith will have a strong market considering he's only 26 years old, has good length and has shown he can be a durable all-around player. His price tag could reach around $14 million per year, which would be a lot for someone with 24.5 career sacks -- and for a team with approximately $20 million in cap space right now. They'd love to keep Crowder and he would be cheaper to retain than Smith. But he could fetch at least $8 million per year on the open market, and that will be tough for the Redskins to match. -- John Keim

The Bears bring back kicker Robbie Gould.
After Cody Parkey's struggles, there's no way they can bring him back even though his $3.5 million in salary and bonuses is guaranteed for 2019. Gould, the Bears' kicker from 2005-15, will be a free agent if the 49ers don't re-sign or tag him before March 13. Gould still makes his home in Chicago, so it would be a natural fit. -- Rob Demovsky

The Lions focus heavily on defense, both in the draft and free agency. 
Last season was all about rebuilding the offensive line and running game (which has been partially accomplished). Detroit will have to do some revamping of its offense to fit what new coordinator Darrell Bevell wants to run, but playmakers are needed at every level of the defense. So don't be surprised if the Lions try to sign a strong corner opposite Darius Slay and bring in a high-level player as a pass-rusher. Who those players are remains to be seen, but in free agency the Lions could be bigger players for some bigger names than they usually are. -- Michael Rothstein

GM Brian Gutekunst makes a strong push for Le'Veon Bell. 
New coach Matt LaFleur's Shanahan/McVay-based offense works best when it revolves around a dominant running back, and the Packers don't have one. They have two capable ball carriers in Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams, but neither is a franchise-changing back. Bell is. He'll be costly, but at this stage of Aaron Rodgers' career, he could use a dominant running back to take some of the pressure off him. The Packers came up short in their pursuit last year of Khalil Mack. Gutekunst will do everything he can not to come up short on Bell. -- Rob Demovsky

The Vikings trade cornerback Xavier Rhodes.
Mike Zimmer would likely fight tooth and nail against losing one of his star defensive players. But Minnesota's best chance at bolstering its weakest link -- the offensive line -- might come from cutting into an area where the Vikings are OK depthwise and have valuable trade leverage. Coming off the most difficult season of his career, Rhodes will turn 29 ahead of the 2019 campaign and account for $13.4 million against the salary cap. Minnesota's crop of cornerback talent is in a good spot with Trae Waynes, Mackensie Alexander, Mike Hughes (who is coming off an ACL injury) and the early rise of undrafted free agent Holton Hill. Trading Rhodes now, knowing they're in a good spot with their rest of their corners, could provide the Vikings with an option to garner more talent for the O-line. -- Courtney Cronin

The Falcons make Julio Jones the league's highest-paid wide receiver at $20 million per year. 
GM Thomas Dimitroff already said Jones' contract would be addressed with two years and $26.4 million remaining. Jones' current average of $14.25 million ranks 11th among receivers, with Odell Beckham Jr. topping the list at $18 million per year. -- Vaughn McClure

Left tackle Matt Kalil will be released. 
With a post-June 1 designation, the Panthers will clear just shy of $7.3 million from the salary cap for a player who missed all of last season with a knee injury and was just average in 2017. The Panthers have many needs they could fill using that cap space. They also have the option of moving right tackle Taylor Moton to the left side and re-signing free agent Daryl Williams, who was the starting right tackle in 2017 before injuries ended his 2018 season. Kalil's five-year, $55.5 million deal was a mistake from the beginning. -- David Newton

The Saints add a well-known slot receiver. 
Tight end is probably a more glaring need in New Orleans. But one way or another, the Saints need to add another reliable pass-catcher after their offense fizzled down the stretch. And the list of pending free agents at slot receiver -- including Golden Tate, Randall Cobb, Adam Humphries, Jamison Crowder and Cole Beasley -- is way more intriguing than the slim pickings at tight end. -- Mike Triplett

The Bucs release DeSean Jackson after failing to find a trade partner. 
This shouldn't come as a shock to fans, but it'll be the biggest development this offseason unless they part ways with Gerald McCoy, too (that's a real possibility if they can't restructure his deal or trade him). Jackson has grown increasingly frustrated with his lack of chemistry with Jameis Winston. It'll be tempting for new coach Bruce Arians to try to make this relationship work, but a clean break could be best. The reason this hasn't already happened is the Bucs believe there's trade value there. Parting ways with Jackson will save the Bucs $10 million, which is much needed considering they enter 2019 with approximately $15 million in cap room. -- Jenna Laine

The Cardinals trade the No. 1 overall pick.
While there are plenty of defensive options for Arizona to take at No. 1, with a new coach in Kliff Kingsbury, the Cardinals would be better suited to trade back to the middle of the top 10 and stockpile picks Kingsbury can use to bolster what was the league's worst offense in 2018. While they're already slated to have about nine or 10 picks, they could increase that by three or four more this year by trading back, and use those picks to essentially revamp one or both sides of the ball. -- Josh Weinfuss

The Rams sign coach Sean McVay to a contract extension.
The Rams signed McVay to a five-year deal when they made him the youngest head coach in modern NFL history in 2017. Three seasons remain on that deal, but after clinching back-to-back division titles and taking the Rams to the Super Bowl in Year 2, you can bet the Rams will want to make sure they keep McVay around -- and keep him well paid -- into the foreseeable future. -- Lindsey Thiry
Draft Academy documents the journey of six prospects, including Sam Darnold and Josh Allen. Watch on ESPN+

The 49ers sign safety Earl Thomas. 
For the second year in a row, the Niners will add a former part of the ""Legion of Boom"" after grabbing Richard Sherman last year. Sherman already has said he's willing to help recruit Thomas if needed, and while Thomas should have no shortage of suitors, the fit in San Francisco is as obvious for him as it was for Sherman in 2018. Thomas would instantly provide the stability the Niners clearly missed in the secondary last season while adding another valuable leader for a young defense.-- Nick Wagoner
The Seahawks re-sign fewer than half of their 14 players scheduled to become unrestricted free agents. 
Frank Clark seems like the only sure thing among that group to be back next season -- be it on a franchise tag or a multiyear deal. Earl Thomas and Sebastian Janikowski are likely goners, and the Seahawks won't get into bidding wars to keep K.J. Wright, Dion Jordan, D.J. Fluker or J.R. Sweezy, given their ages or injury histories. Last offseason, the Seahawks signed so many free agents that their additions offset their losses, resulting in no compensatory picks for 2019. They'll take a more conservative approach this year with an eye toward getting younger and bolstering their draft capital. -- Brady Henderson

25974747,"Roger Goodell said the league will again take a look at instant replay and possible changes this offseason. ""The game is not officiated by robots,"" he said. ""It's not going to be.""
Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman says he received ""one or two'' death threats from frustrated Saints fans on social media after the NFC Championship Game.
The anger about a no-call in the NFC Championship Game has turned into disappointment for Saints coach Sean Payton, who finally has left his ""cave"" almost two weeks later.
""I fully understand your personal disappointment, and the disappointment and frustration of Saints fans throughout the country,"" Goodell wrote in the letter. ""As you know, immediately following the game, our head of officiating told Coach Payton that a penalty should have been called on the play in question. I have expressed the same view to both Mrs. Benson and Coach Payton, as well as during my press conference on Jan. 30.""
Goodell said that league rules prevented him from overturning the result of the game, and he believed it would be wrong for him to do so.
He added that the league's replay rules will be reviewed to determine if there should be a change that would allow review of calls and no-calls of penalties on the field.
Goodell said his response to the governor's Jan. 22 letter was delayed because it arrived at the league office after he had left for the Super Bowl in Atlanta. 
Gov. Edwards released Goodell's letter Monday, saying: ""Though it is cold comfort to New Orleans Saints fans, I applaud the commissioner's willingness to review the officiating error closely to determine if similar errors can be prevented in the future through rule or procedure changes. I appreciate his response to my letter. 
""New Orleans is a place unlike any other, as evidenced by the Saints fans who celebrated their team and their city in lieu of watching the Super Bowl and raised tens of thousands of dollars for charity in the process. It's the Louisiana way to be hospitable to guests, as I know we will be when the Super Bowl next returns to New Orleans in 2024.""

25913355,"A week after he had surgery on his right shoulder, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton didn't provide a timeline on his recovery.
Nothing about the Panthers QB is reserved, and that includes his ""north of $7 million"" cigar bar that soft opens this weekend.
Neither Newton nor the Panthers have publicly offered a timeline for when he could return following surgery on his right shoulder, but one source familiar with the surgery told ESPN that ""it's all positive.""
Newton told 680 The Fan in Atlanta this past week that his throwing arm was ""better than I thought it would be.""
""It's good, it's good,"" Newton added during his interview with 680 The Fan. ""With so much going on throughout this season, I was in fear to see what was actually wrong.""
Newton missed the final two games after battling shoulder pain and discomfort throughout this past season. But after undergoing his second shoulder surgery in the past three offseasons, the former league MVP is on track to be ready to go at some point this summer.
Soreness in the shoulder prevented Newton from attempting deep passes midway through the season and ultimately made other throws difficult as well. The soreness first became an issue following an Oct. 21 win at Philadelphia in which he had to throw 22 times in the fourth quarter.
The soreness got worse as the season progressed, contributing to Carolina's seven-game losing streak after a 6-2 start.
ESPN's David Newton contributed to this report.

25933118,"In a Super Bowl week that was largely bereft of juicy narratives, one of the few intriguing stories centered on the question of whether Rob Gronkowski, the Patriots' delightfully gooberish and uniquely gifted tight end, would retire this year. In the days leading up to the game, reporters posited the question to the 29-year-old player (at one point, he joked he had been asked 50 times), his teammates and even his mother, who claimed ignorance on ""Today."" The day before the Super Bowl, I asked his oldest brother, Gordie, to weigh in. ""Every year, he goes through the same thing and weighs out the options and how he feels,"" Gordie said. ""That's his decision.""
For the Gronkowski clan and their various hangers-on, some of whom have accrued D-list notoriety among Patriots fans, the week felt like the end of an era -- a sort of senior spring. On Saturday afternoon, Gordie, his brothers and their father were standing in a loose circle at a party in Atlanta, basking in the sun as people passed them drinks and requested pictures, the dueling scents of beer and body spray emanating from the scene. If you've seen Rob, you'd probably recognize the Gronkowski family on sight. All four boys look like duplicates of their famous brother -- permutations on a smiley, muscle-y theme.

As one of the family's close friends, a bearded professional wrestler named Mojo Rawley, held court, Gordie mentioned that ""it would be great"" if Rob joined the WWE (a couple years ago, the oft-injured tight end made a surprise appearance alongside Mojo at Wrestlemania; one can only imagine the hideous sound that Bill Belichick's teeth made when someone showed him the video). Gordie added that his brother was likely to start some sort of fitness venture, not unlike their father, who has run a workout equipment business in the Buffalo area for decades.
""And he'll probably be in movies,"" Gordie added, stroking his chin with one hand as he accepted a drink with the other. While Rob has made only a few cameos, he has reportedly worked with an acting coach and has a role as a helicopter gunner in a yet-to-be-released action film starring Mel Gibson.
""He'd be like the Terminator,"" Gordie said. ""Or he'd be like Ivan Drago"" -- he beamed at this thought, leaning in closer -- ""where you're an absolute beast.""
Typically, when a football player approaches the end of his career, the moment marks an opportunity for the people around him to reflect on his growth over the years -- to filter his story through the lens of personal development, grafting an arc onto his career. But none of Gronkowski's family members will indulge in such revisionism. When I asked his younger brother, Goose (real name: Glenn), if Rob had evolved since his first Super Bowl, he looked at me as though I had just asked him if his brother was pursuing a degree in quantum physics.
""I don't think he's changed at all,"" he said. ""He's been the same since he was in fifth grade.""
After the game, when the clock wound down and the blue and red confetti rained down over Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Gronkowski, who had caught the 29-yard pass that set up the game-winning touchdown -- arguably the best offensive play of the game -- yanked his enormous Super Bowl T-shirt over his jersey and pads and sought out his family. When they found each other, the Gronkowskis all started hopping up and down and honking something unintelligible in unison, a sort of tribal chant by way of upstate New York. Rob looked ecstatic.
But by the time he sat down for his postgame news conference, his arm wrapped in the massive brace he has worn since 2013, he seemed more subdued. When asked whether he had just played his last game, Gronkowski deferred.
""Tonight's about celebrating with our teammates,"" he said. ""That decision will be made in a week or two.""
Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski reiterated after the Super Bowl that a decision on his future will come ""in a few weeks or so.""
Four months after the city celebrated its fourth Red Sox title in 15 years, an estimated 1.5 million fans lined the parade route in Boston to fete Tom Brady and the Patriots for their sixth Super Bowl crown.
When might Le'Veon Bell sign with a new team? Which rules are set for a makeover? What happens next with replay? Here's an in-depth look at the offseason.
Someone mentioned a hit he took during the game -- in the second quarter, he collided with a pair of Rams defenders after a short catch -- and he replied quickly, ""Yeah, my quad. It hurts a lot. I can barely walk right now."" He added, his delivery more deadpan than joyful: ""But it's all good, because we're Super Bowl champs.""
After the hit, Gronkowski, who played every snap, staggered off the field. Whenever he suffers a blow -- he has endured more than most players, in part because his gigantic frame makes it difficult for defenders to tackle him any other way -- he limps like a cinematic monster hobbled by arrows. The effect is similarly heartbreaking. Gronkowski had surgery on his spine before entering the league (explaining why the Patriots were able to snag him in the second round), and he has experienced a litany of painful injuries and operations over the years. This season, he missed three regular-season games, reportedly because he was suffering from Achilles tendinitis and a bulging disc in his back.
Earlier in the week, he acknowledged how difficult it has been for him to come back at times.
""Try to imagine getting hit all the time, and trying to be where you want every day in life,"" he said. ""It's tough. It's difficult. To take hits to the thigh, to take hits to your head, abusing your body ... isn't what the brain wants.""
After his news conference at the Super Bowl, Gronkowski trudged to the locker room, where he started peeling his pads off. As a staffer pulled his nametag off his locker (empty, save for a roll of tube socks and a half-eaten sandwich), Tom Brady's personal trainer, Alex Guerrero, walked over and gently unwrapped the tape on his arm. While his teammates sprayed champagne and danced on one side of the room, Gronkowski was quiet -- solemn, almost. A reporter asked him where he was partying, and he muttered in response: ""We'll see, we'll see.""
When he had changed into a towel, the large scar on his shoulder shiny with sweat, it was evident that his right thigh was absurdly swollen, to the point where it looked bloated. His movements were halting. I asked him if he was looking forward to the offseason -- potentially, the rest of his life -- and he smiled softly, ""I'm super excited to just chill.""
Despite being a principal member of a dynastic team that is loathed -- or envied, if you ask New Englanders -- by a sizable portion of the country, Gronkowski is widely beloved. It's not hard to see why. The Patriots tight end is all id and no ego, a court jester whose inhibition-free antics have provided a gleeful respite from the monotony and gloom that have beset the NFL in recent years. And yet: There was nothing escapist about the experience of watching Gronkowski play football. There was joy, to be sure, but there was also pain, a sense of dread that lingered after every bone-crunching hit like a bitter aftertaste. Both sentiments seeped to the surface on Sunday in Atlanta.
So why would he keep playing? For starters: the money. If Gronkowski retires, he'll forfeit about $10 million, assuming New England was intending to pay him (they could cut him at a cost of just $2 million). Even for a frugal superstar who has famously lived off of his endorsement checks for years -- he has made more than $50 million playing football, reportedly stashing it in investments -- that's not nothing, though it's probably not everything. There's also the fear of leaping into the unknown. By all accounts, Gronkowski not only loves the sport, he loves the camaraderie that accompanies the sport, the sort of ritualized bonding that fades away for most of us in adulthood, the absence of which could create a gaping hole in his (probably massive) heart.
If Gronkowski retires now, with just nine seasons under his belt, his volume statistics won't impress. But he should still be a shoo-in for the Hall of Fame. At his peak -- and his peak lasted for several years, which is why he's a four-time All-Pro -- it felt like the tight end position was invented in response to his rare gifts, the singular marriage of power and grace he brought to the game. The same man who plowed through linebackers as a blocker reeled in passes with a feather-soft touch, like a boy catching snowflakes with his tongue. No Patriots receiver has compiled more yards with Brady.
And that, I believe, is why Gronkowski is so widely adored. Not because of ""Yo Soy Fiesta"" or his love of the number 69 or the Gronk Cruise or the Gronk Bus or the Gronk Space Shuttle (that last one is made up, but imagine the Uranus jokes!), but because he excelled at his craft without giving up any part of himself -- except, of course, his body. For those of us who sit in offices all week and lounge on our sofas on Sundays, Brady, with his abstemious lifestyle, is an icon, but probably not someone we aspire to be. We dream of being Gronk.
Goose was right when he said his brother hasn't changed, mentally, since entering the league. On Thursday, when I posed the same question to a few of his teammates, they all scoffed. ""He's the exact same person,"" said longtime New England safety Patrick Chung, who also added, unprompted, ""he's also very intelligent -- just so you guys know that.""
Matthew Slater, the Patriots special teamer who has played alongside Gronkowski for all of his eight seasons, agreed.
""With everything he's accomplished as a player, he's kept that childlike joy,"" he said. ""I think there's something to learn from that, for all of the serious adults in the room. Like myself.""

While they were talking, Gronkowski loped into the hotel ballroom, waving at all of his teammates. When he sat at his podium, he was immediately asked about his pending retirement decision -- ""today's a maybe,"" he cracked -- and how he felt after such a demanding season.
""It's a grind, mentally and physically, but I've been doing it my whole life,"" he said. ""I've been doing it now, playing football, every year since seventh grade. I don't know anything different.""
A reporter pointed out that Chung was wearing a hat that said ""DILF"" earlier, and Gronkowski lit up, grinning for the first time. He responded to a question about whether he ever ran into trouble because of his free-wheeling personality by shaking his head.
""I was pretty outrageous at some points ... but I always showed up and got it done,"" he said.
In other words: He wasn't a New England player in the traditional sense, but he still followed the Patriot Way.
Someone asked Gronkowski if he ever looked back at his past shenanigans and wondered why he acted the way he did.
""Nah,"" he said. ""It's pretty sweet.""
And then he giggled, emitting one of his signature ""huh huh huh"" laughs, his voice rising at least an octave.
""Maybe more to come soon,"" he said.

But in the meantime, the league's busy calendar will hold our attention and in some ways keep us busier than we are during the season itself. There's plenty on tap, even if Sundays won't be the same.
Rule changes, personnel moves and ownership drama are only part of what we have to look forward to. With Super Bowl LIII behind us, let's take a closer look at the key dates and what the big league priorities are heading into the offseason.

Dates to know | Big priorities
Feb. 19: The franchise/transition period begins. Every NFL team can use either tag on one pending free agent to ensure, at the very least, the right of first refusal should he sign an offer sheet elsewhere. The biggest candidates for the franchise tag include a foursome of pass-rushers: the Dallas Cowboys' Demarcus Lawrence, the Houston Texans' Jadeveon Clowney, the Kansas City Chiefs' Dee Ford and the Seattle Seahawks' Frank Clark. Read more on the Lawrence, Clowney and Ford cases from NFL Nation.
Feb. 26-March 4: The scouting combine comes to Indianapolis. The annual draft meat market will give us a better idea of the 2019 quarterback class, information that if nothing else will provide a leverage point for projecting the top of the draft. At the moment, the highest-rated passer on both ESPN's Mel Kiper's and Todd McShay's big boards is Ohio State's Dwayne Haskins (No. 6 and No. 10, respectively). Is Haskins, Kyler Murray or perhaps even Duke's Daniel Jones worth consideration at No. 1 overall?
Darren Woodson and Victor Cruz react to Kyler Murray declaring he is firmly committed to playing in the NFL.
March 5: The deadline for franchise/transition tags hits at 4 p.m. ET. Most of the tag action occurs late in the process, after teams and players have tested each other for parameters of a long-term deal. Any team that wants to use its tag must file paperwork before the mid-afternoon deadline.
March 11-13: The free-agent negotiation period opens. Referred to by some as a time for ""legal tampering"" -- which makes no linguistic sense -- this intense period allows teams and agents of pending free agents to negotiate deals. Most of the offseason's major contract agreements will take place during this time. The 2019 class could be headed by Pittsburgh Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell, who sat out 2018 rather than play a second season under a franchise tag. Available quarterbacks will include Teddy Bridgewater, Tyrod Taylor and possibly Nick Foles. Here are the top 50 free agents available on the market.
March 13: Now it's official. Flip the calendars because the new league year begins. At 4 p.m. ET, all teams must be under the league's salary-cap ceiling, projected to be between $187 million and $191.1 million. Technically, each team's cap number is the sum of the cap numbers for its top 51 players. After that point, free-agent deals can be made official, as can trades. Significant names on the trade block include Steelers receiver Antonio Brown, Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco and perhaps Foles, if the Philadelphia Eagles use the franchise tag on him with the purpose of auctioning him off rather than allowing him to leave as a free agent.
Adam Schefter breaks down the latest on Ryan Tannehill's status with the Dolphins.
March 24-27: Ah, the annual league meeting. With the gathering in Phoenix, owners will hold their primary meeting of the year. This is where two significant rule changes are debated and long-term plans are mapped out. Items on the competition committee agenda will include adjustments to replay and punting. The 2021 expiration of the league's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with players also will come into sharper focus.
April 1: The first offseason workouts take place. The NFL's eight teams with new head coaches can begin their offseason programs.
April 15: The NFL's remaining 24 teams can begin workouts.
April 25-27: It's draft time! Nashville, Tennessee, is the site for the 2019 event, which for the first time will be telecast on ABC, ESPN and the NFL Network. The Arizona Cardinals own the No. 1 overall pick.

1. Continue referee overhaul amid renewed officiating focus
There will be at least two more new NFL referees in 2019 following the retirements of Walt Coleman and Pete Morelli. The new additions mean the league will have replaced more than half (10 of 17) its crew leaders since the start of the 2014 season. That will be the backdrop for a deep analysis of every aspect of the department, starting with why it needed two in-season clarifications from the competition committee in 2018 to dial down rule interpretations. Senior vice president Al Riveron's effectiveness will be evaluated, as will a precedent-setting decision to fire down judge Hugo Cruz during the season for performance reasons.
2. Examine replay
If nothing else, the competition committee will stage a robust discussion about replay following the missed pass-interference call in the NFC Championship Game. Historically, owners have stamped out any discussion about adding penalties, non-calls and subjective decisions to replay. They remain unlikely to support a massive overhaul, but a limited compromise could emerge. One possibility, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter, is to expand the list of challengeable plays with a strong penalty disincentive. Another is to allow a replay official to step in to correct clear and obvious mistakes.
Adam Schefter says the NFL will discuss a rule change during the offseason that allows coaches to challenge judgment calls.
3. Make the punt safer and less penalized
After making substantive changes last season to the kickoff, with what they consider strong success, league decision-makers are ready to move on to the punt. In announcing a crowdsourcing effort for ideas, the league said that the punt ranks second behind kickoffs in the highest rate of concussions. It is also the most penalized play in the game on a percentage basis, according to competition committee chairman Rich McKay. (There was a flag on 12.9 percent of punts in 2019, compared to, say, 3.2 percent on pass plays, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.)
Some special-teams coaches find the newest initiative confusing because the league's goal in tweaking the kickoff was to make it more like a punt. For that reason, it's possible that the most substantive changes -- if they are approved this offseason -- will be focused around reducing flags. Something as simple as new interpretations of existing rules, like emphasizing the need for forcible contact on illegal blocks in the back, could make an impact.

Ownership change is nothing new in the NFL, but the league will keep its eye on two franchises this offseason.
The Seahawks haven't said much about their long-term plans following the death of Paul Allen in October. His sister, Jody Allen, is now the chairman of franchise, but the presence of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at Super Bowl LIII was an interesting development. Bezos, whose primary company headquarters is in Seattle, has long been coveted as a future partner by other NFL owners.
Meanwhile, the family of Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen is engaged in a legal fight to determine which of his heirs will one day gain control of the team. Bowlen suffers from Alzheimer's disease and ceded operation of the team to a family trust in 2014.
5. Align the helmet rule with reality
The NFL took the unprecedented step in 2018 of only occasionally enforcing a major new rule, opting instead for a phase-in process that left coaches, players and outside observers confused. The prohibition on lowering the helmet to initiate contact with an opponent was approved more quickly than most NFL rules, producing substantial preseason confusion and leading to the necessary step of pulling back enforcement. There were only 19 flags and a total of 28 fines for the foul, but the league issued 139 warning letters. That approach made the best of a problematic situation, but it can't continue.
To maintain credible game administration over time, rules must either be enforced or struck down. The helmet rule isn't going to be eliminated; NFL research showed that lowering the head increases the likelihood of a concussion. So the league will have to find a way to begin plausible enforcement and hope that players and coaches are better equipped after a year of practice to make the adjustment.

One major spring league will debut just days after the New England Patriots claimed Super Bowl LIII. Another is scheduled to kick off in 2020, in conjunction with a third that has been in operation since 2017. Neither the Alliance of American Football (AAF) nor the XFL nor The Spring League are meant to challenge NFL supremacy. If anything, their long-term success could hinge on a formal developmental agreement with the NFL.
In the meantime, they could produce ideas worth stealing. The AAF, for example, has banned kickoffs and will provide alternatives to the onside kick when it opens play Saturday. The XFL has promised to ""reimagine"" the game of football. Ahead of its launch, the XFL is partnering with The Spring League, which stages games from March 28-April 11 in Texas, to test ideas for quickening game pace and minimizing idle time.
7. Expand injury-reduction strategies
Concussions dropped 23.8 percent in 2018 after league executives implemented a multipronged plan to minimize brain injuries. Encouraged by those results, the league will look to focus its data on hamstring, knee, foot and ankle injuries.
Among the studies either underway or set to begin soon: associating the best (and worst) cleat styles with the various surface types in NFL stadiums. The league also will put sensors in the mouthguards of players from four teams to learn more about collision speeds and consequences.
8. Ensure a smooth game in Mexico City
Commissioner Roger Goodell said at the Super Bowl that Hispanics represent the NFL's fastest-growing audience. A major part of that growth is the promise of a regular-season game in Mexico City, one that was canceled in 2018 because of poor field conditions. There is blame to spread on both sides for that fiasco, but the league must do its part to make its 2019 return successful. Although domestic television ratings grew by 5 percent in 2018, the NFL knows that its best option for audience expansion is through international outreach.

25988157,"Let's grade the trade that sent former Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco from the Ravens to the Broncos, which reportedly cost Denver a midround pick in the 2019 NFL draft:
The news that the Broncos are dealing for Flacco is a reminder that the things we've known about the league for years are still true.
‚Ä¢ Trade grade: Why Broncos get low marks
‚Ä¢ Broncos still need long-term QB solution
‚Ä¢ Flacco's legacy defined by playoff success
‚Ä¢ Will trade cause ripple effects in NFL?'
‚Ä¢ Flacco's smooth handoff to Jackson
To start, nobody knows anything about evaluating quarterbacks. If anybody should be an expert on which quarterbacks actually have the ""it"" factor and are about to turn into superstars, it should be John Elway, who is now the Broncos' general manager.
The Hall of Famer won two Super Bowls as part of a glittering 16-year career under center for the Broncos. He took over a floundering Denver team after the disastrous Josh McDaniels era and immediately led it back to the postseason. Elway nailed his two biggest decisions in replacing Tim Tebow with Peyton Manning (which was more controversial at the time than it seems now) and by swapping out John Fox after a 12-4 season for Gary Kubiak. The Broncos won Super Bowl 50 the following season.
Everything else Elway has done with the quarterback position has led to Wednesday's move. He used a second-round pick on Brock Osweiler in 2012, drafting the 6-foot-7 Arizona State product 18 picks before the Seahawks chose Russell Wilson. Elway tried to retain Osweiler with a significant offer north of $12 million per season in free agency, only to be outbid by the Texans. When that failed, Elway traded up in the first round of the 2016 draft to grab 6-foot-7 Memphis quarterback Paxton Lynch, who couldn't beat out 6-foot-3 seventh-round pick Trevor Siemian in two chances for the starting job before being released.
Elway broke from type briefly after Lynch bombed to a nearly unprecedented degree by signing 6-foot-1 Case Keenum in free agency last year. Keenum didn't live up to the heights he reached with the Vikings in 2017, unsurprisingly, but he also delivered the best season the Broncos have gotten from a quarterback since Manning in 2014. Keenum posted a 46.9 QBR on a team whose two best offensive linemen (Ronald Leary and Matt Paradis) combined for 15 starts. The Broncos traded Demaryius Thomas in midseason and then lost Emmanuel Sanders to a torn Achilles for the final month of the season. Keenum wasn't great, but he was about what Elway & Co. should have expected.
Sure adding Flacco is another high-profile QB addition for John Elway. It doesn't mean wins in 2019 or help the Broncos' future.
The Broncos have agreed to acquire QB Joe Flacco from the Ravens, likely in exchange for a midround draft pick, sources told ESPN. The deal means the Ravens are committing to Lamar Jackson.
The most successful QB in Ravens history delivered one final clutch play -- allowing them to hand the ball off to his successor without controversy.
All of that brings us to the next lessons. In the NFL, shorter quarterbacks like Keenum have to constantly prove they can play. Tall quarterbacks get chance after chance to prove they can't play. And more important, when NFL coaches and executives are on the ropes, they're going to turn to what they know or what has worked in the past.
Come on down, Joe Flacco! The Broncos traded a midround pick to the Ravens for their deposed 6-foot-6 starter, who lost his job to Lamar Jackson and immediately saw the Ravens make a run to the postseason. ESPN's Adam Schefter noted that Flacco got enthusiastic recommendations from new Broncos coach Vic Fangio and former team executive Kubiak, each of whom was in Baltimore with Flacco earlier in his career.
Flacco has posted exactly one above-average season by passer rating or net yards per attempt since his incredible run to the Super Bowl in 2012. His Total QBR over that six-year stretch is 53.8; among the 20 passers with 2,000 or more pass attempts over that time frame, the only quarterbacks Flacco beats out are Eli Manning, Ryan Tannehill, Derek Carr and Blake Bortles. (Keenum's QBR over that time on 1,844 attempts is 51.5.)
Flacco has 5,670 career pass attempts with an ANY/A+ of 94. He has been a slightly below-average quarterback over the course of his 11-year run. Having turned 34 in January, it's hard to believe he is suddenly going to get better over a multiyear run, especially given the lack of talent the Broncos have on offense.
It will now become more difficult for the Broncos to improve that talent. In addition to sending a midround pick to the Ravens for Flacco -- and Denver does have two fourth-round picks in this draft -- the Broncos are inheriting the three years and $63 million remaining on Flacco's onerous contract with the Ravens. That contract is unguaranteed, so the Broncos could get out of Flacco's contract after one season if things go wrong.
In 2019, though, the Broncos will add $18.5 million to their cap, which leaves them with $18.3 million in space per Spotrac. Denver can create $10.3 million in room by releasing the injured Sanders, but it probably needs to add at least one veteran wideout, if not a tight end to go with him. The Broncos need to find a way to bring back Paradis, their star center, given that they're already weak up front.

They're also stuck with a minimum of $10 million on their cap for Keenum, who has $7 million of his $18 million base salary guaranteed in addition to $3 million of his prorated signing bonus. Keenum will have no trade value at that $18 million figure and will likely be released by the Broncos unless he takes a huge pay cut, which wouldn't make sense.
Even more unfortunate: The combo of Flacco and Keenum creates total uncertainty at the position beyond 2019, thus making it a pretty good time to draft a quarterback, even if it's not in Round 1. As noted above, that has not gone well for Elway to this point.
Denver will have $28.5 million on its 2019 cap for Keenum and Flacco, with no quarterback of the future on the roster. It's hard to fathom how the Broncos got here, but it's an incredibly unenviable position.
The Ravens have to be thrilled to get a midround pick for Flacco, who was out of their plans and likely to be released unless Baltimore found a trade partner. The compensation suggests there were multiple teams in for him or that new general manager Eric DeCosta managed to persuade the Broncos to negotiate against themselves. The Ravens will eat $16 million in dead money on their 2019 cap and then be rid of one of the worst contracts in modern NFL history.
Baltimore needs to find a new backup for second-year quarterback Jackson, and it will presumably look for a player who more closely matches his skill set. The obvious fit is Tyrod Taylor, who came up in the Ravens system and had his best run as a pro under current Ravens offensive coordinator Greg Roman in Buffalo.

25945704,"Newton detailed the Jan. 24 arthroscopic surgery to repair cartilage damage and his mindset moving forward on the ""Cam Newton YouTube"" channel that was launched on Thursday.
""A lot of people are saying they've seen the best of Cam Newton,'' the 2015 NFL MVP said. ""Everything that's been said that I don't like, straight up. I'm not here to knock on doors. I'm here to kick the m-----f----- down. Seeing the doubt, hearing the whispers of 'He don't got it no more,' that's what makes this comeback even more extraordinary for me.
""I feel this is going to make me even more dangerous. When it's all said and done, I can look back at my life, and I know this particular time in my life propelled me to that next point. I'm excited about what the future holds.''
The Panthers believe Cam Newton could be ready for training camp after last month's shoulder surgery and certainly expect the star quarterback to be ready to start the 2019 NFL regular season, a league source told ESPN.
Carolina has several big personnel decisions looming, and how the QB's arm responds to treatment is likely to affect the team's offseason plans.
Despite the foot injuries, the Panthers' Pro Bowl tight end says when healthy, ""I've been as productive, if not more, than anybody in the league.""
The Panthers are optimistic Newton will be ready for the start of the 2019 season after surgery revealed the damage in the shoulder wasn't as bad as anticipated.
In the video, Dr. Pat Connor is shown telling Newton shortly after the procedure: ""The damage, that cartilage damage, was not as extensive as we appeared. It was pretty small. If we can get that motion back and keep it, we'll be pretty good.''
Newton admitted in the video there were times, between a seven-game losing streak after a 6-2 start and the ""nagging'' pain in his shoulder, that he was scared and didn't want to be around family and friends.
""I didn't know what the f--- was wrong with my shoulder,'' he said. ""I just knew that it hurt and I knew it was an issue. I couldn't throw the ball but 30 yards. No lie. ... So I was trying to keep up with it as much as possible that I could until the wheels fell off. And this is what happened.
""I felt like defenses was exposing me because I couldn't throw the ball downfield. Not being in a position physically to be able to make the throws that you know you're capable of making, that was the disheartening thing of the whole year.''
Newton was so limited that the Panthers finally shut him down for the final two games.
""At one point [in] time I felt as if we were Super Bowl contenders,'' said Newton, who even at the start of the seven-game losing streak said he was playing the best football of his career. ""As the season kept progressing and going forward, I knew the status of my arm was still uncertain, but we were still winning games.
""Everything that we wanted to accomplish in the season was right in front of us. And then, hmm, everything switches. It didn't really get to me until probably the fourth or fifth [straight] loss. Not only was the losing affecting me, it was my body.''
Newton said that's when he withdrew from many of those close to him.
""I just backed myself into this hole,'' the first pick of the 2011 draft said. ""I was hurting. As a man, as a gladiator so to speak, this persona we want to play, you can't show no weakness. I was weak. And I felt so vulnerable. I felt so scared. I felt so afraid. I knew I wasn't myself.''
The video went from Newton talking to a camera to him driving to the hospital for the surgery to being put under for surgery.
""It's 5:30 a.m., January 24. Surgery day,'' Newton said. ""Today's main goal is to go in the shoulder, the joints, the labrum, the rotator cuff and everything around it. A lot of people in this situation would be scared, or just want this s--- to stop. Shoulder aching, whatever the f--- they've got to do, I'm just going to get this s--- over with.''
Newton said he launched the channel to give his fan base a more detailed look into his life.
""I know there's a lot of YouTube channels,'' he said. ""I want this one to kind of be a little different. I want it to have more drip, swag, sauce ... all that.
""Hopefully, you will see a side of Cam you've probably heard about but never could grasp until now.''

25908384,"The Eagles are expected to use their franchise tag this offseason on quarterback Nick Foles in an effort to then try to trade him, according to sources on other NFL teams who have been in touch with Philadelphia.
Foles is unlikely to return to Philly, leaving the only questions being where will he end up and by which method.
Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Chris Long was named the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year on Saturday for his activities off the field.
The Eagles refused to specify any of their plans for Foles. But being that other teams already have inquired on Foles' price, and it is expected to be around a third-round pick, the way for Philadelphia to secure the quarterback's rights this offseason would be with a franchise tag.
Before using their franchise tag, the Eagles could pick up Foles' $20 million option in the next week, per league sources. Foles then has the ability to void the option by paying the Eagles $2 million, which he also would be expected to do, per sources. And in turn, the Eagles then would be expected to place their franchise tag on Foles, giving them the ability to try to trade him to another team, which it sounds as if the team is determined to do.
The Eagles also could delay picking up Foles' option or not do so at all, and simply tag him, a source said. That's the simple way for the team to engineer a trade without Foles having to repay the $2 million.
For the second consecutive season, Foles came on in place of injured starter Carson Wentz and led Philadelphia on a late-season run to the playoffs.
Foles, 30, threw for 1,413 yards, 7 touchdowns and 4 interceptions while appearing in five regular-season games and two playoff games a year after he led the Eagles to the franchise's first Super Bowl victory.

Gruden, 22, has spent the past two seasons on the Redskins' staff, first as a volunteer and then as a video assistant this past year.

25916069,"ATLANTA -- Place that hate in your hands, hold it like a fistful of beach sand and then let it slowly dissolve through your fingers until it is going, going, gone. The New England Patriots deserve nothing but your unmitigated respect and admiration. Chances are, we will never again see anything like them in our lifetimes.
For the 44 states in the union that don't call the Patriots the home team, Sunday night should mark the end of a dysfunctional relationship and the beginning of something pretty special. New England beat the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 in Super Bowl LIII, winning ugly to claim its sixth championship since the day in September 2001 that sixth-round pick Tom Brady took the field as a gaunt and barely coordinated game manager and started developing into the finest football player who ever lived.
It's time for the nation to embrace the non-debate. The Patriots' dynasty is the greatest in the history of American sports, college or pro, and the contempt for it outside Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut should be eliminated along with the Rams.
America loves winners and workers and team-centric people who create new boundaries for human achievement. The Patriots have won two-thirds of their staggering nine Super Bowl appearances since Bill Belichick put Brady under center. They started this by beating the heavily favored Rams of St. Louis in Super Bowl XXXVI, and they just continued it 17 years later by beating the underdog Rams of Los Angeles. They started this by being erroneously accused of filming a St. Louis Rams practice, and they just continued it by apparently being concerned enough about the presence of a potential Los Angeles Rams spy to conduct all their preparation business indoors.

""There are 20-story skyscrapers surrounding the field,"" Belichick had said during the week. ""I don't think we can have a public practice out there.""
Forget about Spygate and Deflategate and any other gate you can get your dirty hands on. The Patriots have long defied a league built on the virtues of parity, a league that uses the salary cap, the draft, free agency and the schedule to prevent Belichick and Brady from doing exactly what they have done. Unlike the dynastic franchises of the NBA, NHL and MLB -- the Chicago Bulls, Boston Celtics, Montreal Canadiens and New York Yankees -- the Patriots could never fall back on the margin for error allowed in best-of-five and best-of-seven series. And unlike the college dynasties of John Wooden, Geno Auriemma and Nick Saban, Belichick's Patriots can't recruit the country's best players year after year. Champions get punished in pro football and are forced to draft prospects from the bottom of the bin.
In Vince Lombardi's time, restraint of trade allowed pro football's overlords to keep their teams intact. Belichick has had to constantly turn over his roster, replacing decorated veterans who want to convert team success into wages worth more than the coach wants to pay against the cap. This truth puts pressure on Belichick to constantly identify and develop talent and to inspire his players to play above their projected limits. It's worth noting that seven Patriots touched the football on the final two touchdown drives (totaling 18 plays and 166 yards) in the historic Super Bowl comeback victory over Atlanta two years ago, and not one of those Patriots was picked in the top 100 of his draft class.
This time around, the triumph was less dramatic but no less meaningful. Belichick, a 66-year-old grandfather, is an old acquaintance of Sean McVay's grandfather John. Belichick beat an opposing coach half his age to become the oldest Super Bowl winner of all and to tie George Halas and Curly Lambeau for most NFL titles. The 41-year-old Brady became the Super Bowl's oldest winning starter, the first player to collect six rings and, on the big-picture scoreboard measuring all titans, the first guy in a long time to tie Michael Jordan. And don't think for a second Brady doesn't know it.
From the postgame stage, after saying the large sections of Patriots fans made Mercedes-Benz Stadium feel like Gillette Stadium, Brady explained how he could continue playing after scaling so many mountains. ""Look at this,"" he said as the cheers washed over him. ""How could this not motivate you?""
Brady wants to pass Jordan with No. 7, bet on it. He started his career by winning three of four titles. Why should he finish it by winning three of five when he could just as easily win four of six?
As always, Belichick will be right by his franchise player's side. Sunday night, Belichick survived a rock fight with young McVay, his texting buddy, by fielding the stronger team in the fourth quarter. Nobody knows how physically and mentally draining an endless Super Bowl Sunday can be better than Belichick. He knows how to pace his team. He also knows how to recover from devastating defeats like the one he suffered to the Philadelphia Eagles last year, and how to navigate his team through an uneven regular season and prepare it to win the whole damn thing.
""In the biggest moments,"" Belichick said from a postgame podium, ""when we had to play our best football and compete the hardest, they did it.""
Earlier, as he waited outside the news conference room for Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman to finish up, Belichick playfully shouted, ""The MVP can wait."" When the coach was done talking, he headed down a hallway holding hands with his girlfriend, Linda Holliday, and disappeared into the winner's locker room, where his players were hugging each other and dancing to blaring music.
One of last year's conquering Eagles, Lane Johnson, had observed the Patriots have no fun. To be clear, Belichick's players appeared to be having a blast.
The roots of Belichick's dynasty can be traced to a rough-and-tumble neighborhood in West Orange, New Jersey, where Amos Alonzo Stagg, the son of a laborer who taught himself how to read and write, was born during the Civil War. One of the founding fathers of the forward pass, Stagg was coaching college ball at Pacific in the 1940s when he schooled a player named Wayne Hardin, who was the head coach at the Naval Academy. The young son of Hardin's assistant, Steve Belichick, approached him for a little help.
Bill Belichick asked Hardin what position he should play in youth football, and the Navy coach responded, ""Turn around, bend over and snap the ball to me."" Hardin thought the first snap wasn't delivered with enough purpose and told the boy to try again. Belichick nailed the do-over. ""Don't change it,"" Hardin barked.
As a developing center and coach on training wheels, Belichick closely studied Heisman winners Roger Staubach and Joe Bellino and other Navy players as they treated every practice, every detail, with extreme urgency. That was the Academy's culture in Annapolis, where the midshipmen were trained to make life-or-death decisions. Phil McConkey, one of Steve Belichick's players in the 1970s, said Belichick ""was the toughest coach I ever had by far. He wasn't only preparing us for football, but to be combat officers in the U.S. Navy.""
Steve's only son was profoundly impacted by Academy discipline and drive and built his football teams around the notion that every minicamp session in the spring and every preseason game in the summer should be treated with the intensity of Game 7 of the World Series. That's why the Patriots are the Patriots. That's why Belichick has won as many Super Bowl rings as a head coach as Don Shula, Tom Landry and Bill Parcells combined.
This victory over the Rams felt like a culmination of something much bigger than the 2018 season, especially with Belichick spending the week in a relaxed, this-is-your-life mode. He spoke of childhood trips to the battlefields of Gettysburg and the monuments of Washington, D.C., and to the basement of the Pro Football Hall of Fame to review their archives of books on the game's enduring elders, such as Stagg, Walter Camp, Halas and Lambeau. Belichick spoke of his father's personal collection of about 4,000 football books. Steve Belichick was interested only in pre-1960 material, and when hunting with his son for that material in used-book stores or the Salvation Army, he didn't want to pay more than a dollar.
The Patriots and their quarterback are carving out a big spot in the Super Bowl history books after clinching their sixth title.
It wasn't the prettiest Super Bowl for fans of offense, but a fourth-quarter TD helped the Patriots beat the Rams for Brady's sixth title.
Quarterback Tom Brady became the first player in NFL history to win six Super Bowls, as the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 in Super Bowl LIII on Sunday night.
Bill Belichick spoke last week of a boyhood spent reading sports classics such as Jerry Kramer's ""Instant Replay,"" George Plimpton's ""Paper Lion"" and Jim Brosnan's ""Pennant Race"" about five times apiece -- and left out the fact that A.A. Milne's ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" was his favorite read in the early years. He spoke of his tough-guy high school coach, Al Laramore, and his current tough-guy assistant, Dante Scarnecchia -- a former Marine sergeant who looks more like a boxer's cutman than the best offensive line coach in the game. He spoke of the lessons he learned about receivers' tendencies from Tom Coughlin, his Giants staff mate under Parcells, and about blitz pickups from another Giants staff mate, Tom Bresnahan, on rides into work.
And then he drew on all those lessons over the decades to beat the Rams in Super Bowl LIII. A year before his death in 2017, Hardin told a reporter that he would rank Belichick above his own former coach, Stagg, and Lombardi as the greatest ever if he won a fifth Super Bowl title. Now Belichick has won six, and the late, great coach who showed him how to snap a ball with conviction would have surely been proud.
You can certainly make a case that Belichick temporarily lost his locker room last year. He angered Brady by stripping team access for the quarterback's fitness guru and business partner, Alex Guerrero, and he angered the majority of the roster by benching Malcolm Butler in the loss to the Eagles. Brady and Rob Gronkowski and others acted out on social media platforms, and sources said in late March the quarterback was still considering leaving New England rather than playing for his head coach one more season.
Brady sent a firm message to Belichick by becoming the league's only starting quarterback to not show up for organized team activities. Deep down, after repeatedly saying he wanted to play until age 45 and after compelling the franchise to trade his would-be successor, Jimmy Garoppolo, Brady knew he couldn't walk away. He showed up for the mandatory portion of the preseason schedule, and people who know Brady and Belichick sensed a subtle shift in how the latter managed the former. Known for coaching his best player in a relentless, unforgiving way, Bill seemed to have taken a little off his fastball. Early on, Bill seemed to be going a little out of his way to praise Tom.
Brady's father, Tom Sr., was asked the other day if he believed Belichick had gone a bit easier on his son this year. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""We don't really talk much about those things.""
Asked if he felt his son looked happier this year than last year, Tom Sr. said, ""Maybe. But remember, he had 12 stitches in his hand this time last year. I'm just happy he's healthy now. Everyone said Tom was falling off this year, but I didn't see it. We didn't have the fast receivers to make plays down the field, and the offense had to change, and Tom had to adjust to that. I just didn't see the drop-off. We could've been 12-4 without that [lateral] play at the end against Miami.""
Belichick ultimately lost home-field advantage to Kansas City by putting Gronk on the field against Miami to defend a Hail Mary that was never going to happen, then made up for it by beating the Chiefs two weeks ago. Super Bowl LIII was Belichick's chance to make up for his Butler gaffe in Super Bowl LII. And wouldn't you know it, he went 2-for-2.
Jon Bon Jovi, Belichick's longtime friend, was standing outside the New England locker room Sunday night when he told ESPN.com he felt this year's Patriots team had better chemistry than last year's Patriots team. ""The organization is just running well these days,"" Bon Jovi said. ""Tommy is getting along with Bill, [Bill's] getting along with [Patriots CEO Robert] Kraft, and Kraft's being nice to him. It seems like they're peace-ing it out. Winning will do that to you.""
Bon Jovi agreed this was one of Belichick's top two or three coaching jobs, right there with the 2001 season. ""But geez,"" the rocker said, ""it's apples and oranges, isn't it? He brought these guys together after five losses, the Miami little debacle and the loss to Pittsburgh. And it just seems Gronk got healthy and Tommy started playing the underdog, even if that was just in his head.
""He says, 'I suck. I'm old.' ... If you want to think about it, everybody's a Monday-morning quarterback. Last year, it was just, 'Greatest, greatest, greatest.' What was your motivation? Philly came in and they were the underdog. This year Tommy says, 'I'm the underdog. I'm the underdog.' I think about all that now.""
As the confetti fell following this victory over the Rams, the main characters from last year's soap opera were all seen embracing each other. Belichick hugging Brady. Brady hugging Kraft. Brady hugging Guerrero. Outside the Patriots' locker room stood Don Yee, the neighborly agent for Brady and the dispatched Garoppolo. Yee was another participant in last year's madness who wore a big smile on his face.
The Patriots tied the Pittsburgh Steelers' record for Super Bowl titles because Belichick and Brady, with a combined age of 107, outperformed McVay and Jared Goff, with a combined age of 57. They tied the record because de facto defensive coordinator Brian Flores, from Mike Tyson's neighborhood in Brooklyn, KO'd the great Wade Phillips in a battle of suffocating defenses that at times felt like the Steel Curtain Steelers of the 1970s vs. the 1985 Chicago Bears. The Patriots prevailed because Belichick knows how to coach punters and knows how to turn a running quarterback from Kent State and the 232nd pick in his draft, Edelman, into one of the most prolific postseason players of all time. The Patriots prevailed because Gronkowski, a leaguewide laughingstock after his Miami follies, made the biggest catch of what could be his final game, because Jason McCourty made a ridiculous play to break up a Brandin Cooks touchdown and because a Belichick signing from Buffalo, Stephon Gilmore, intercepted a Goff pass near the end zone that all but killed the Rams' spirit.
""I was just like, in my head, 'I know you didn't throw this right now. You see me looking at you,'"" Gilmore said of Goff.
In the end, Belichick celebrated another magical moment with family and friends. The last time he beat the Rams in a Super Bowl, he embraced his daughter, Amanda, and sons, Stephen and Brian, on the field. He did the same Sunday night, though his kids are all grown up now. Amanda is the women's lacrosse coach at Holy Cross. Stephen and Brian are assistants on their old man's staff.
Belichick's Patriots might win another title or two before the coach, and Brady, call it quits. But even if they never earn another division title or playoff berth, they have secured their standing as the greatest American sports dynasty of all. They also have earned the right to be admired, unconditionally, from coast to coast.
It's high time for the other 44 states in the union to come around. Sunday night, the message from the Patriots was simple. Don't hate them because they're beautiful.

25997605,"Your brief NFL offseason breather is over. It's tag time.
The NFL now moves into its first offseason window for major personnel decisions. Beginning Tuesday and continuing through March 5, teams can place either the franchise or transition tag on one pending free agent. It's an expensive decision that provides substantial leverage against losing a cherished player -- and in many cases depresses the value a player might realize on the open market.
Before things get too crazy, let's run through everything you need to know about the tag process and how it applies to the 2019 offseason.
The franchise tag is a labor designation that restricts a player's potential movement in exchange for a high one-year salary. It is governed through the collective bargaining agreement (CBA), represents a fully guaranteed salary once signed and has two types.
Jadeveon Clowney is among the players who could get tagged as early as Tuesday. NFL Nation reporters make their predictions.
The Steelers resetting without Antonio Brown and the Bears bouncing their kicker are among the moves predicted.
So long, 2018 season. It's never too early to look ahead to 2019. Our crew of insiders weighs in on the biggest topics of the offseason.
The first is the ""exclusive-rights"" tag. Any player with this tag is bound to the team for the upcoming season. His agent is prohibited from seeking offer sheets elsewhere. The second is the ""non-exclusive"" tag. In this scenario, players can sign an offer sheet with another team. The original team has the right to match the offer. If it doesn't, it will receive two first-round draft picks from the new team.
The transition tag is less expensive but isn't used as much because it does not extract compensation from the new team. NFL teams have employed it six times since the CBA was signed in 2011, most recently in 2018 by the Chicago Bears on cornerback Kyle Fuller. (The Bears matched the four-year, $56 million offer sheet Fuller signed with the Green Bay Packers.)
The only advantage of the transition tag is that it allows the original team to match an offer. It has sometimes been used to judge the market value of a pending free agent. This year, there have been some indications that that the Pittsburgh Steelers will use it on running back Le'Veon Bell as a way to impose a level of control over his future.
I was afraid you would ask this question. Tag values are position-specific. Here's the basic math:
The exclusive-rights tag is calculated by taking the average of the top five players' cap percentage at the position for the current season, or 120 percent of his previous year's salary, whichever is greater. It has the highest value among the tags, and its specific value isn't determined until late April to account for current-year deals.
The non-exclusive franchise tag is determined by calculating the average cap percentage at the player's position during the past five years, or 120 percent of his previous year's salary, whichever is greater.
The transition-tag value is calculated by taking the average of the top 10 players at a position during the past five years.

It depends on the interest level between the sides. The player can sign the tender at any time, a decision that fully guarantees the salary and immediately places all of it on the current year's cap charge. This can increase a player's leverage in a tight cap situation; the team will be motivated to negotiate a longer-term deal to lower the cap number. That decision also can backfire if the team is comfortable with the high cap number. The leverage in this case would side with a player who remains unsigned as camp looms. A tagged player can't participate in offseason workouts or any camps until he has at least signed the tender.
In either event, the sides have until July 15 to agree on a multiyear extension. After that point, the player can sign only a one-year contract, which cannot be extended until after the season.
Yes. The Carolina Panthers did just that to cornerback Josh Norman in 2016 when they determined they wouldn't be able to sign him to a long-term extension. A rescinded tag is among the risks a player takes when he doesn't immediately sign the tender. It can't be rescinded once it is signed.
Yes. In fact, there have been reports that the Philadelphia Eagles could do just that with quarterback Nick Foles. In this scenario, the compensation is agreed to by both teams and does not necessarily have to be two first-round picks. The new team can accept the terms of the tag or renegotiate into a multiyear deal.
Decisions each year are based on unique current details, but there has been an average of 6.3 franchise tags per year over the past six offseasons.
If productive long-term negotiations don't materialize, the possibilities include:
DeMarcus Lawrence, DE, Dallas Cowboys
Dee Ford, DE/LB, Kansas City Chiefs
Jadeveon Clowney, DE/LB, Houston Texans
Frank Clark, DE, Seattle Seahawks
Trent Brown, OT, New England Patriots
Landon Collins, S, New York Giants
Trey Flowers, DE, New England Patriots
Grady Jarrett, DT, Atlanta Falcons
Stephen Gostkowski, K, New England Patriots
Not necessarily. During the past six seasons, it has happened in less than half of the situations. According to ESPN Stats & Information research, there have been 38 franchise tags extended: 17 signed multiyear deals during their tag season, while 21 did not.
Among those who did not sign long-term deals was Bell, who sat out the entire 2018 season rather than play under the tag (or agree to a new deal) with the Steelers. That list also includes defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul, who had a special circumstance after injuring himself in a summer fireworks accident.
That seems unlikely. Forget the $14.45 million tag value he missed out on, Bell went an entire year without being paid an eight-figure salary. Assuming he enters the free-agent market this spring, Bell at the very least must find an offer large enough to make up for the base value of the multiyear Steelers contract he turned down during negotiations. It reportedly would have guaranteed him $33 million over the first two seasons. It would be quite an accomplishment to get that value added to any deal he eventually signs.
The NFL hasn't calculated the values yet, and one of the twists of the franchise-tag window is that teams can extend players without knowing the exact figure. The numbers will be released in the coming weeks (no later than the March 13 start of the new league year). In a few cases, deals that happen between now and then can affect the exact numbers. The exact per-team salary-cap total -- also not solidified yet -- can change them as well.
The 2018 numbers for the non-exclusive tag are in the chart. The NFL has projected its 2019 salary cap will fall between $187 million and $191.1 million, a jump of about 5.5 percent. You can expect roughly similar growth in the positional values.
These are last year's numbers. The 2019 numbers have not been released yet.
The franchise tag pays a player close to market value for one year, but provides no future guarantees. The tag becomes an advantage if a player remains healthy and valuable enough that the team feels compelled to use it multiple times. The value of the second tag is 120 percent of the first, and the third 144 percent of the second.
It happens more often than you might think: 16 times since 1997, including five times since 2011: Cleveland Browns kicker Phil Dawson, Cowboys linebacker Anthony Spencer, Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins, Los Angeles Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson and Bell by the Steelers.
It is much less common for skill players. Two years ago, Cousins became the first quarterback ever franchised in consecutive years. There have been only four other skill players tagged twice at any point in their careers: quarterbacks Drew Brees (2005, 2012) and Peyton Manning (2004, 2011), receiver Rob Moore (1995, 1999) and Bell (2017, 2018).

Yes. Per ESPN Stats & Information, 30 offensive linemen have been franchise-tagged since 1993, while 29 defensive ends and 26 linebackers were tagged. On the other end, there have been four punters, 10 quarterbacks, 11 tight ends and 12 running backs franchised.
You're right, and sometimes that causes conflict between players and teams. Offensive line positions, for example, are valued quite differently from a financial perspective. Teams will pay much more for a left tackle than, say, a right guard. But it costs the same to franchise them. For pass-rushers, disputes often arise from whether a player is designated as a defensive end or an outside linebacker. The CBA says only that it should be based on ""the position at which the franchise player participated in the most plays during the prior league year."" Today's hybrid schemes can sometimes make that answer a debatable point.
Yes, but given the 26-year span of the tag's existence, the numbers are more a function of talent and cap management than a philosophical opposition or support of the tag itself. Every team in the league has used it at least once. The Indianapolis Colts have used it an NFL-high 11 times, followed by the Chiefs (10), Seahawks (10) and Arizona Cardinals (10). The Texans (one), Falcons (two) and Browns (three) have used it the fewest times.

The Courier-Journal, citing terms of House's contract, reported that he would have to pay Kentucky $150,000 to buy out the final year of his deal.
For a time it appeared House would stay at Kentucky, but instead he has a deal that will bring him to Kansas City.
House will rejoin new Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. He was a defensive assistant for Spagnuolo, who was the head coach of the St. Louis Rams at the time, from 2009 through 2011.

25975979,"BEREA, Ohio -- Cleveland Browns general manager John Dorsey believes in second chances, so he'll give running back Kareem Hunt the chance to reset his career with the team.
Kareem Hunt, who was released by the Chiefs in November after a video surfaced that showed him shoving and kicking a woman last February, signed with the Browns on Monday.
Outside the Lines interviewed witnesses and reviewed police documents and nearly four hours of officer bodycam video for the most complete account to date of the night that jeopardized Kareem Hunt's NFL career.
Dorsey said Hunt has to earn the trust of the team and the city, and nothing is guaranteed.
The Kansas City Chiefs released Hunt after a video surfaced of him shoving and kicking a young woman in February 2018 outside his residence in Cleveland.
The NFL placed Hunt on the commissioner's exempt list shortly before he was released. The league will continue its investigation into this incident and two others involving Hunt that took place in 2018.
Here's a look at where Hunt stands, and what his addition means.
Now that he has signed a one-year contract with the Browns, Hunt again will be placed on the commissioner's exempt list. While he is on that list, Hunt cannot practice or be with the team.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell had this to say about the case during Super Bowl week: ""Kareem Hunt, I think, everyone knows that he's under investigation. He is a free agent. If he is signed by a club, the clubs understand that he will go on the commissioner's exempt list at that point in time until the discipline process has concluded -- whether there is discipline or not discipline, when we finish the investigation and make a determination. There has been a tremendous amount of progress in that investigation.""
Dorsey said he hopes to have a resolution within two weeks, but ESPN's Dan Graziano reported that a source had said the discipline process is ""still ongoing and nowhere near done."" It is important to keep Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston in mind. In June, the NFL recommended a suspension, but the NFL Players Association worked with the league to negotiate a three-game ban. Hunt's case could follow a similar track, with the league making a recommendation and the union and league negotiating a final agreement. At this point, the league has not gotten to the point of a recommendation.
He cannot participate in offseason workouts, practices or preseason games until a final decision on a suspension is made. At that point, Hunt comes off the exempt list, and his discipline begins the first game of the season.
The first game of the 2019 season. His punishment would begin Week 1 and last the number of games of the suspension.
There was no rush to sign Hunt, though had the Browns waited, other teams might have taken him off the market. Obviously, if he's going to be on the team, the Browns would like him around for OTAs and minicamp, but Dorsey said the timing was more happenstance than anything. ""I felt, we felt very comfortable after doing all our research that we were OK with this moving forward,"" Dorsey said. ""And I was OK with that.""
He signed a one-year deal, which means if he gains an accrued season in 2019, he will be a restricted free agent after the season. If that happens, the Browns would be able to match any offers received from another team. To gain the accrued season, Hunt would have to be on the 53-man roster for 10 games. If he doesn't get the accrued season, he would be an exclusive rights free agent, which ties him to the Browns in 2020. Essentially, by signing him now, the Browns will own Hunt's rights for two seasons.
Yes. ""That means you'll have good competitive depth in training camp,"" Dorsey said. Competitive depth, though, does not always work in the season. The Browns have Nick Chubb, who ran for 996 yards as a rookie, and Duke Johnson Jr., who signed a three-year contract extension in June. Both were valuable contributors the final eight games of the season after the move was made to put Freddie Kitchens, now head coach, in as offensive coordinator. Hunt and Johnson can be used in a variety of ways, but teams have a hard time finding the carries and snaps for three backs. Carlos Hyde was the lead back in the first six games in 2018. When the Browns decided Chubb had to play, Hyde was traded to Jacksonville.
On the surface, it might not seem to affect him much given he's the Browns' starting back, but Hunt started 27 consecutive games in Kansas City, and as a rookie in 2017 led the NFL in rushing with 1,327 yards. Hunt's addition could have a large impact on Chubb's carries, although Kitchens and new offensive coordinator Todd Monken should be able to find enough snaps for both.
Dorsey answered that question this way: ""Duke Johnson is a fine football player. But what it does is you have three very quality, really four quality individuals. [Dontrell Hilliard is the fourth.] You have three veterans on there now. I don't think it makes [Johnson] expendable yet. What you have to do is you have to go back and research your options and see moving forward what's best for the organization."" Obviously the word that jumped out was ""yet.""

25930941,"BOSTON -- An estimated 1.5 million jubilant fans jammed downtown Boston on Tuesday for a parade celebrating the New England Patriots' sixth Super Bowl title, clamoring for more with cheers of ""We want seven!"" and ""Next year, right here!""
A party atmosphere enveloped the city as fans clad in team garb packed sidewalks in the mild weather and stood on tiptoe for a glimpse of quarterback Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick and the rest of the team. Red, white and blue confetti rained down.
It's a familiar feeling in Boston. The parade came just four months after the city feted the Red Sox for their fourth World Series championship in 15 years.
""Getting to see Tom Brady again is always a special day, but the Patriots are amazing. Six-time champs,"" fan Lauren Mills said, adding that she still hasn't had her fill. Her message to Brady: ""Go for No. 7. He still has how many fingers left? You know, four more rings to go.""
Rob Gronkowski partied shirtless; Tom Brady shared the moment with his kids and Julian Edelman waved the Lombardi Trophy to a huge crowd.
So long, 2018 season. It's never too early to look ahead to 2019. Our crew of insiders weighs in on the biggest topics of the offseason.
Julian Edelman's Super Bowl MVP award shouldn't send him to Canton. But that shouldn't stop us from celebrating one of the best postseason wide receivers of all time.
Security was tight, and authorities said a dozen people -- including seven juveniles -- were arrested, and many charges were alcohol-related. One man who appeared intoxicated was taken away on a stretcher, and five of those arrested were involved in a brawl near the end of the parade route.
Mayor Marty Walsh warned fans not to throw anything. Errant beer cans slightly damaged the Red Sox World Series trophy last year.
Fresh from Sunday's 13-3 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta, team members and their families took a two-mile swing through the city aboard Boston's iconic World War II-era amphibious ""duck boats.""
Brady held his pigtailed daughter, Vivian, and they waved and grinned at the crowd as players and team owner Robert Kraft took turns holding aloft the Lombardi Trophy. Belichick and his partner, Linda Holliday, beamed, and the storied coach doffed his cap.
Star tight end Rob Gronkowski, who has talked about retiring after this latest NFL title, whooped it up with his brothers and father. He and several other players removed their shirts and spent the second half of the parade cavorting bare-chested.
They waved large signs that read, ""We Got Everything"" -- a twist on the Patriots' motivational hashtag, ""Everything We Got,"" that had become a theme this season.
At least one brave Rams fan, wearing one of the team's blue and yellow jerseys, hung out along the parade route.
Police estimated that about 1.5 million people attended, making it one of the largest crowds Boston has seen for a championship parade. Early trains and subways were jammed, overwhelming the area's transit system with what officials said was record ridership. The weather was unseasonably warm, with temperatures above 50 degrees and dazzling sunshine.
Unlike in past years, no post-parade rally with speeches was done. Officials didn't elaborate as to why.
Stephen Chhom, of Lynn, Massachusetts, was along the parade route overlooking the Statehouse with his friend Ricky Sok and Sok's six-year-old son, Raiyu.
""What made this year special were all the other fans doubting us,"" Chhom said, wearing a Julian Edelman jersey. ""The record speaks for itself. Tom Brady and the rest of the team prove themselves every single time.""

25933124,"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay said Tuesday that the game plan going into Super Bowl LIII was to have running backs Todd Gurley and C.J. Anderson share the workload.
Gurley had 11 touches for 34 yards, while Anderson had nine touches for 34 yards in the 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday.
""We just didn't get a lot of attempts off,"" McVay said. ""So that really ended up being a big result of what ended up happening where neither Todd nor C.J. got involved.""
Two weeks after Todd Gurley, the highest-paid running back in NFL history, was limited to five touches and 13 total yards in the NFC title game, Gurley had 11 touches for 34 total yards in the Super Bowl.

""It's cool, man,"" Gurley said after the g
The Rams ran 60 plays and gained 260 total yards as they scored the fewest points in McVay's two seasons as coach. They were 3-of-13 on third down.
Gurley, who signed a record-breaking, four-year, $60 million contract extension before the season, declined to speak with reporters through a team spokesperson Tuesday as players cleaned out their lockers.
Gurley rushed for 1,251 yards and scored a league-best 21 touchdowns before he was sidelined for the final two games of the regular season because of inflammation in his left knee.
He played a limited role in the NFC Championship Game and Super Bowl following a performance in a divisional-round victory over the Dallas Cowboys in which he rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries.
Speculation regarding Gurley's health grew as his numbers declined, but Gurley has not appeared on the injury report since Jan. 10, when he was listed as a full participant in practice, and he has repeatedly said in the days and weeks since that his knee has felt ""fine.""
Players underwent routine end-of-season physicals Tuesday, and McVay said there were no plans for any offseason procedures on Gurley's knee, which is the same knee he had surgery on in 2014 to repair a torn ACL.
""As far as I'm concerned and as far as I know, that isn't the case where we're planning to do anything like that,"" McVay said.
The Rams signed Anderson with two games remaining in the regular season, after a string of injuries to their running back corps. Trusted backup Malcolm Brown suffered a clavicle injury in Week 13 and was placed on injured reserve, and second-year pro Justin Davis suffered a shoulder injury in a Week 15 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, before Gurley was sidelined for a series in the third quarter. Rookie John Kelly was inserted and struggled in pass protection, all of which prompted Anderson's signing.
In Gurley's absence, Anderson rushed for a combined 299 yards in victories over the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers.
When Gurley returned in the divisional round of the playoffs, he shared carries with Anderson, and the two combined for 238 rushing yards and three touchdowns.
McVay said Tuesday that the game plan through the NFC championship and Super Bowl was to replicate that model.
""They both were just in a really good rhythm,"" McVay said. ""And I think the ideal scenario that we had gone into the playoffs with was what you saw in Dallas, where it was both of those guys getting involved.""
But that's not how it panned out.
Against the Saints, Gurley had five touches that resulted in 13 yards, including a 6-yard touchdown run. He also committed two uncharacteristic mistakes in the first half when he let a ball bounce off his hands for an interception, and when he let an open pass fall incomplete on third down in the red zone. Anderson rushed for 44 yards in 16 carries.
After the game, Gurley called his performance ""sorry"" and expressed relief that the Rams would advance to the Super Bowl. McVay said he failed to get Gurley into the flow of the game.
In the two weeks leading to the Super Bowl, McVay said he felt obligated to get his star running back involved. But a lack of plays against the Patriots, McVay said, made it difficult.
Gurley played 43 snaps (66 percent), while Anderson played 22 (34 percent).
""We didn't get the amount of plays off and didn't really have any drive continuity where we're punting more than we did,"" McVay said. ""And that's a big result of why those opportunities were limited for him.""

25979972,"According to a police incident report, Steelers receiver Antonio Brown allegedly used both hands to shove the mother of his daughter to the ground last month.
In a brief message from the Super Bowl in his first public appearance since the team's season ended, Steelers WR Antonio Brown says he just wants to win and that it doesn't matter where.
Police cited Brown Nov. 8 for allegedly driving a black Porsche more than 100 miles per hour through Ross Township, Pennsylvania. Officers were looking for a possible suspect from a bank robbery when they located Brown.
Brown has paid $426.77 in fines and has 30 days to appeal the guilty verdict, according to the magistrate.
Brown's attorney declined comment afterward, according to WPXI. Reckless driving convictions in Pennsylvania can result in fines, a suspended license and up to 90 days in jail.
That evening, Brown scored a touchdown in a 52-21 win over the Carolina Panthers. He declined comment when approached after that game, and on his way out of the locker room, he told teammates reporters couldn't catch him.
Brown has faced multiple legal cases in South Florida, where he was born and raised. Last month, Brown allegedly pushed the mother of his daughter to the ground after she refused to leave his property over reimbursement for the daughter's hair appointment, according to a Hollywood (Florida) police report. The mother did not want to press charges, and Brown is seeking custody of his daughter, family attorney Jaclyn Soroka told ESPN. Legal attorney Darren Heitner called the allegations ""baseless and false."" The NFL and the Steelers are investigating the matter.
In October, Brown faced two lawsuits from an April incident during which Brown allegedly yelled at security and threw items off an apartment balcony, according to documents obtained by ESPN. Both cases are in the process of being resolved.
The Steelers are considering trading Brown after he failed to show for a Saturday walk-through in Week 17.

""I told the driver,"" Teuhema said. ""Like, 'Oh, hell yeah, I'm playing football again.'""
Teuhema quit the moving job two days later.
The Hotshots secured Teuhema's rights in the player allocation draft of the Alliance of American Football, which kicks off its inaugural season on Saturday. The linebacker is the type of player for whom the AAF was created. He spent two years at LSU, was kicked off the team -- for ""a couple off-field incidents,"" he said -- and resurfaced with the Southeastern Louisiana Lions. He went undrafted in 2018 and participated in rookie minicamps with the Chicago Bears and the New York Jets.
He wasn't signed. He figured football was done and found a job. After a month or so, Savage called.
The AAF is a league of first chances and last chances, of comebacks and closure. Of finding a way to keep playing football and creating depth the NFL doesn't have time to develop.
Who's in this new league? Where can I watch? What are the major rules differences? We're answering every question.
The Head Ball Coach is back, this time as the star attraction for the Orlando Apollos. And while it may be a new league, it's going to be the same high-flying offense he's known for.
The Alliance of American Football has a 2019 launch date, a TV contract, an eight-city blueprint and a vision for a league alongside the NFL.
Players aren't getting rich -- not on their three-year, non-guaranteed contracts worth $250,000. But it is a potential path back to a more lucrative payday. For the majority of the 416 players on the eight AAF rosters, they hold out hope of one day reaching the NFL again or getting there for the first time.
Almost everyone here -- coaches, players, general managers and even co-founder Bill Polian -- has been waived, fired or gone unsigned during their football careers. At some point, the NFL told them they were not good enough.
And yet, they still want to play.
""That's why I call this league 'football in its purest form,' because money hasn't affected this the way it does in professional football or other sports,"" said San Diego coach Mike Martz, one of the few with little desire to return to the NFL. ""It's just enough. You're playing this game because you love this game, and you like to keep playing it.
""That's why I think it's the purest. There's no other influences other than the pure love for this game.""
Denard Robinson was home in Jacksonville, Florida. NFL teams stopped calling a long time ago. Once a star quarterback at Michigan, Robinson converted to running back because he wasn't an accurate enough passer and the league had yet to embrace the type of offense in which he thrived with the Wolverines.
Robinson lasted four NFL seasons, but he hadn't played since his rookie contract with Jacksonville ended in 2016. He had workouts -- notably with Chicago and the Jets in 2017, where he said New York tried converting him to cornerback -- but no one signed him. He appeared retired even if he wasn't.
Then his agent called and told him about an upstart league. He was unsure. The CFL had called, but he had turned them down. The combination of pay, tax rates and being in Canada, far from his young son, was not palatable. This new opportunity was closer. The money was decent. But he knew nothing about the AAF.
The 28-year-old was sick of sitting on his couch in Florida and flying to Michigan to do the occasional appearance. Yet Robinson wasn't fully ready to pursue post-playing plans. He had sketched out potential playbooks to use if he pursued coaching and had written his thoughts and memories down for a potential book about his life and his time at Michigan, where he's still revered.
He was still uneasy about it.
""Started writing down a lot of stuff and, look, you have a chance to play football again and get paid for it, something you always dreamed about,"" Robinson said. ""Even though it's not the NFL, it's something. Something you could do for four months, and if it's not what you want to do for the next two, three years, then get into your life.""
So he agreed to play but had to get in shape first. Robinson said he weighed 240 pounds in November and ""had a Gucci Mane belly"" -- a massive change from his time at Michigan, when he was maybe 180 pounds. He looked in the mirror, bigger than he'd ever been in his life, and wondered, ""What in the world are you doing?""
Robinson dropped 25 pounds in two months to reach 215. He wants to get down to 200 pounds eventually, although he might never return to his old weight again. Along the way, he figured this was a real chance. The NFL might see his tape. Give him one more shot.
If it doesn't, he'll play for two seasons, turn 30 and use it as a potential bridge to coaching. It would allow him to end football on his terms. He already began mentoring the younger backs on the Atlanta Legends -- much like Maurice Jones-Drew and Justin Forsett did for him when he was drafted by the Jaguars. He's offered younger players who haven't experienced the NFL little tricks of pass protection and footwork he was taught as a rookie.
""I want to go back to the NFL and this could be something that I could say, 'Hey,'"" Robinson said. ""Sometimes I get into that coaching mode while I'm here. I start thinking about coaching, like, 'OK, this is the kind of offense I would run.' Stuff like that. If I was a head coach, this is how I would do it, too. If I was a coordinator, this is how I would do it. If I was a running back coach, I would want to learn it like this.""
His offensive coordinator in Atlanta is Michael Vick, one of his boyhood idols. His head coach was supposed to be offensive guru Brad Childress. But by the end of the first week of training camp, that changed after Childress abruptly resigned.
This isn't the NFL. Robinson knew that. In a league of first chances and last chances, his new coach was finally getting his shot.
Kevin Coyle walked onto the field at the Dub Farris Athletic Complex in San Antonio for the Legends' fourth practice of training camp. He didn't know that by the end of the day, he'd be coaching the team.
He had planned on coordinating the defense. Yet Childress wasn't there. Coyle was told to run practice. Things happen -- he didn't think it that unusual -- so he conducted the workout.
""Came back that afternoon expecting that it was probably going to be something that was ironed out by the time we came off the practice field,"" Coyle said. ""Obviously it wasn't. Things happened extremely fast.
""Next thing I knew, I was in this position and dealing with staff, dealing with practices, schedules, everybody in the organization now that you have to communicate with, from the trainers to the equipment people to the director of football ops to my friend Frank [Kleha, the team's PR director].""
He's describing this while sitting in the M Club of the San Antonio Marriott Northwest, where his team stayed for a month during training camp. The Pro Bowl is on the television screen behind him. The team is a long way from that. Its meeting rooms are in the Sam Houston ballrooms -- the offense is in Salon C -- and a curtain separates the players from a hallway doubling as the makeshift equipment room. A sign for weigh-ins says they took place earlier this morning in the hotel's fitness center.
The 63-year-old had been a defensive coordinator with the Miami Dolphins, Fresno State, Maryland, Syracuse, Holy Cross and the Merchant Marine Academy in his career -- and this wasn't how the Staten Island native thought he'd land a head-coaching gig. A career assistant in his possible last chance coaching football ended up with his first shot leading a team on his own.
""Over 40 years,"" Coyle said. ""But it's never been a driving force for me. I really enjoyed being a coordinator on defense, having your own side of the ball that you really were kind of like, you're a general, you have your troops here and you do your thing.""
Still, he compiled notes on what he'd do if it ever happened. The night of his unexpected promotion, he took out a calendar blotter, stared at the days and mapped out his vision -- one a little different from Childress'. Coyle added a boombox for music during stretching. Shifted practice times. Altered scheme.
Coyle knows his hiring was a change. But everyone in this league knows glitches will happen; player after player on team after team referred to it as a startup business instead of a nascent football operation. This just happened to be a noticeable one -- Childress is one of a few coaches who left the AAF. The others, like San Diego offensive coordinator-turned-Dallas Cowboys quarterbacks coach Jon Kitna, had NFL or major college jobs to go to.
And that's a goal of the league -- graduate people to better gigs.
Malachi Jones has never played in a regular-season NFL game, but he's seen enough football to believe in this league. The son of former Notre Dame captain Andre Jones, godson of Raghib Ismail and brother of Detroit Lions receiver TJ Jones, he's seen the game at its highest level.
His own path is complicated. After four years at Appalachian State, he was in training camp with the Atlanta Falcons. After being cut, he played in the National Arena League, where he was 2017 Rookie of the Year for the High Country Grizzlies.
He signed with Albany of the Arena Football League last year, earning Rookie of the Year and Receiver of the Year honors after a 1,156-yard, 29-touchdown season. Days later, he signed with the Chicago Bears at the start of training camp.
Childress, then a Bears offensive consultant, told him about the AAF. The coach said he should play in it if he were cut by Chicago, which he eventually was. Jones, who made little money in the AFL (between $20,000 and $40,000) and worked part-time at his mother's school in the offseason, saw joining the AAF as a multifold opportunity: Make better money. Get better tape. Play outdoor football.
He considered sticking with Albany. He was on his way to becoming an Arena star. But the allure of making it to the NFL was too much.
""I just view it as a second chance,"" Jones said. ""This league, the idea around it, I think it's an awesome idea. It gives guys like myself and other players that have either been in preseasons and haven't had a stint in the NFL or had multiple stints in the NFL, it gives guys an opportunity to get that productive film that maybe a practice squad player might not get.""
So he signed. He figures at worst, it's a chance for good benefits, salary and a chance for the graphic design major to take advantage of the league's offseason educational and internship programs.
This league is giving him what it's providing so many other people in it, from coaches to general managers to players and even support staff: another shot at the top.
""It's all about hitting the right team at the right time,"" Jones said. ""Not saying that the organizations I was with prior, that I wasn't good enough to play there or whatever it may be, but I wasn't the right fit at the right time.
""And I feel like if I keep pressing and keep producing great tape and showing teams that I'm a team player and willing to do anything to make the team better, I feel like I'm going to get to the right organization at the right time.""
That's the dream of the Alliance of American Football.

25920798,"ATLANTA -- The NFL plans, Bill Belichick laughs.
The future of football is offense, we've all been told for months. NFL scoreboards spent September, October and November like a pinball machine on tilt as innovative coaches and favorable rule changes laid waste to the offensive record books and sent a half-dozen teams scurrying to hire clones of Rams coach Sean McVay.
The Patriots defensive playcaller could open doors for other assistants of color.
What's in store this offseason? Nick Foles and Le'Veon Bell head south, Antonio Brown moves west, and Browns fans make playoff plans.
Follow along with how the Patriots and Tom Brady got past the Rams to win their sixth Super Bowl during a wild day in Atlanta.
Then, Sunday night, came Super Bowl LIII, in which Belichick's New England Patriots throttled McVay's high-scoring Los Angeles Rams 13-3 to win the lowest-scoring Super Bowl of all time. It was Belichick's sixth Super Bowl title as a head coach to go with the two he won as a defensive coordinator. That it came against McVay and the 11th-highest-scoring team in NFL history sent a message that defense isn't dead after all. And who better to send such a message than the all-time coaching master who was already a defensive mastermind way back when McVay was still in diapers.
The future of football might be offense. It might be defense. It might be robot quarterbacks on hoverboards throwing to genetically engineered four-armed receivers on roller skates. All we know for sure is that, while Belichick is still coaching the Patriots, the future of football is on hold.
""Coach Belichick did an outstanding job,"" McVay said when Sunday's game was over and the number next to his team was still, incomprehensibly, a three. ""There really is no other way to put it. I'm pretty numb right now, but definitely, I got out-coached.""
Yeah, you give Belichick two weeks to prepare, he's generally going to figure it out. He and Brian Flores, the linebackers coach who has been calling New England's defensive plays this season and is expected to be named head coach of the Miami Dolphins this week, designed a game plan to stymie the Rams' ground game and flummox quarterback Jared Goff. To hear the Rams tell it, it worked.
""They played six on the line all day, which kind of limited the space to get the runs in there,"" Rams left tackle Andrew Whitworth said. ""They played an open-field 6-2 almost, but with one guy in the middle -- almost a little bit of goal line. And they played a lot more zone than they played all season, so that kind of shook it up a little bit.""
Bill Belichick breaks down the Patriots' game plan to stop the Rams' running game and having Stephon Gilmore shadow Brandin Cooks.
That was the key difference. The Patriots' defense played more man coverage during the season than any team in the league. But Sunday night, New England was in zone on about 40 percent of its defensive plays. That might not sound like a lot, but it's a lot more than the Patriots showed in any game film the Rams were able to watch the past two weeks, and it worked.
""When they start running zone, you've got to hold it a little bit,"" Whitworth said. ""And then they end up rushing six guys -- all NFL rushers, all guys who can rush in the NFL -- somebody's going to have a mismatch somewhere.""
The results were a bit similar to what happened to Goff and the Rams in their Week 14 loss in Chicago. That night, the Chicago Bears played a bunch of zone concepts and intercepted Goff four times in a 15-6 victory. Until Sunday night, that point total was the Rams' lowest of the season -- by 17.
""They mixed it up,"" McVay said of the Patriots' Super Bowl game plan. ""In the early downs, all they ended up playing was some single-high buzz structures and some quarters principles. Then on third down, they had their designers and things like that. It was a great game plan.""
Up front, the Patriots succeeded in their first two playoff games against the Los Angeles Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs by running a constant stream of games and stunts to generate pressure on opposing quarterbacks. That was the same Sunday night. The difference was, the zone looks on the back end made Goff more hesitant with his reads, which gave the guys up front even more time to generate the pressure on him. According to ESPN Stats & Information tracking, Goff faced pressure on 38 percent of his dropbacks and was 3-for-12 with an interception when pressured, tied for the worst completion percentage for any quarterback who threw at least 10 passes under pressure in a Super Bowl.
Overall, Goff completed just 50 percent of his passes in the Super Bowl. He was 3-for-10 on third down, and the Rams failed to convert any of their first eight third-down situations. He was 0-for-5 on passes traveling at least 20 yards downfield, which tied for the highest number of such throws without a completion in any game so far in his three-year career.
""You think at some point you're going to come out of it, as we have all year,"" Goff said. ""And we almost did.""
Almost, indeed. The Rams were moving the ball in Patriots territory, down 10-3, with a little more than four minutes left in the game. It was second-and-10 from the New England 27. Goff was in the shotgun. Flores called a zero-blitz (basically, send everybody). Goff saw it and knew he had to unload the ball quickly, to Brandin Cooks, who was sprinting toward the end zone. Goff threw off his back foot. The ball floated.
""My reaction was to try to get a P.I. [pass interference],"" Cooks said. ""But I couldn't get the angle to.""
Said Goff: ""I knew they were bringing cover-zero blitz there, and I tried to hit Brandin on a go-ball. But [Patriots cornerback Stephon] Gilmore was too far off for me to make that decision. It was a bad decision.""
Gilmore knew what he had to do.
""All I was thinking was, 'Don't drop it,'"" Gilmore said. ""We knew when they get near the end zone they like to take shots. Our defensive line put great pressure on him, he chucked it up, and I was able to make a play.""
By the time Goff and the Rams got the ball back, they were down by 10 with 1:12 left and it was basically over. The real shame of it was, for the Rams, that their own defense was so good. If you'd told McVay and Goff on Sunday morning that the Rams' defense would hold the Patriots to 13 points, they'd have put the champagne on ice before they took the field.
""They were tough on defense,"" Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said. ""They definitely had a good game plan and made us work for everything. There wasn't anything.""
Brady got them with one good touchdown drive in the fourth quarter, which was all he needed because of the way his own defense played. The Patriots' 13 points were the fewest ever scored by a winning team in the Super Bowl. Oddly, their 10-point margin of victory was their largest in a Super Bowl in the Brady/Belichick era.
""Team defense,"" Belichick said. ""There is not one guy that can stop the Rams. They have too many good players and they're too well-coached. We played the run competitively, we rushed the passer competitively, we covered competitively, and we didn't give up big plays, which they hit on everybody.""

It was a brilliant defensive game by a brilliant defensive coach at the end of a season defined by offense. Belichick has made it clear time and again that he's willing to cut against the grain, strategically, if that's what it takes to win a game, and Sunday night might have been his macro masterpiece in that arena. While the rest of the league was trying to figure out how to top McVay and all of these high-flying offenses, Belichick decided the better idea was to figure out how to stop them.
""It's a clich√© saying, but I think it's ultimately true -- defense wins championships,"" Rams defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh said. ""Their defense outplayed us.""
That was, quite clearly, the story of Super Bowl LIII. Yes, Belichick tied Curly Lambeau and George Halas for the most NFL titles by a coach. Yes, Brady broke a tie with Charles Haley and became the first player to win six Super Bowl rings. Yes, the Patriots tied the Steelers for the most Super Bowls titles.
But all of this happened because the Patriots, as they almost always do when confronted with a puzzle, came up with a way to solve it that no one saw coming. Defense isn't dead after all, and Belichick delivered that message in front of the largest audience possible by using defense to load the latest Infinity Stone into his gleaming gauntlet.
The game might be changing, and at some point it might undergo the tectonic change the Rams' 54-51 Week 11 Monday night victory over the Chiefs was supposed to have heralded. But neither of those teams mustered a single first-half point against Belichick's Patriots in his past two games. He beat them both, and reminded us all that the NFL is going to have a hard time changing as long as he's up there grinding out game plans in Foxborough.

25980659,"Antonio Brown has officially requested a trade from the Pittsburgh Steelers, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Tuesday.
The news of Brown's trade request comes right after the Pro Bowl wide receiver tweeted a farewell to the Steelers and their fans, saying it is ""time to move on and forward.""
Thank you SteelerNation for a big 9 years...time to move on and forward..........‚úåüèΩ #NewDemands pic.twitter.com/fbIoFNdqK4
Brown, 30, has been the subject of widespread trade speculation after he failed to show up to work the day before the season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Team president Art Rooney II told reporters last month that something changed with Brown the last week of the season, and he wasn't sure why. He said he had reached out to Brown to no avail.
Antonio Brown wants the Steelers to trade him, and NFL Twitter has plenty of ideas about what that could mean and where he should end up.
Trouble between the Steelers and Antonio Brown has been ""brewing for years,"" and a once-unthinkable split is now possible. Here's how they got here.
GM Chris Ballard has strict criteria for high-priced talent, and impulse moves to add players with off-field concerns do not fit his vision for Indy.
Agent Drew Rosenhaus told ESPN on Jan. 25 that he had spoken to the Steelers to express Brown's ""position"" but wouldn't divulge details.
A source close to Brown believes the wideout is tired of playing the scapegoat for the Steelers' problems and wants to show he can thrive in another offense.
Brown is due a $2.5 million roster bonus on March 17. If the Steelers trade him before that date, they would absorb $21.12 million in dead money on their salary cap. That amount would rise to $23.62 million if Brown is traded after March 17.
Brown, who turns 31 on July 10, is due salaries of $12.625 million in 2019, $11.3 million in 2020 and $12.5 million in 2021.
He has no guaranteed money left on his contract. Trading Brown after June 1 would allow the Steelers to spread the cap hit over multiple years, according to ESPN's Dan Graziano -- $9.54 million in 2019 and $14.08 million in 2020.
The Steelers have been prepared for trade scenarios and believe they can get a high draft pick for Brown. One high-ranking AFC executive believes the Steelers will ask for a first-round pick.
Antonio Brown has six straight seasons with at least 100 catches, the longest streak of its kind in NFL history. He led the NFL with 15 touchdown receptions and is tied for the most seasons with 100 catches and at least 10 touchdown receptions in NFL history.
Brown has hinted he wants the San Francisco 49ers to make that move. He's used social media to photoshop himself in a 49ers jersey and FaceTimed with 49ers legend Jerry Rice, who last month told 95.7 the Game that Brown ""badly"" wants to be in San Francisco.
A recent ESPN article highlighted Brown's rocky relationship with the Steelers, who tolerated Brown's antics for years. Brown was routinely late for meetings and games and lived off campus during training camp, multiple teammates said. But largely that wasn't a problem because Brown worked so hard and produced on Sundays.
Then things changed in 2018. Brown became incensed on the sideline in Week 2 against Kansas City. That next week, he tweeted ""trade me let's find out"" to a former Steelers staffer who wrote that Brown should thank quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for his production. A source said Brown wasn't happy with Roethlisberger's public critiques of his route-running in a Week 12 loss to Denver. And the Week 17 issues confused many with the team.
From the Pro Bowl, several key Steelers publicly supported a Brown return. But now, the Steelers seem resigned to the fate. Asked for a reaction Tuesday, one player said he simply didn't have one anymore.
ESPN's Jeremy Fowler and Field Yates contributed to this report.

25931482,"Texans head coach Bill O'Brien had done double duty as the team's offensive coordinator the past two seasons but will cede that title to Kelly, who has been with the team for the past five seasons.
Asked by reporters about who will call the offensive plays in 2019, O'Brien said, ""I think that's always been a collaborative effort for us.
""There's no doubt in my mind that Tim Kelly is ready to call plays and that's something that will always be, like I said, a collaborative effort. On the outside, people may say, 'What does that mean?' Well, there's a lot that goes into a playcall. Obviously, you don't have a lot of time to make a playcall but there's a lot that goes into it. You need input from everybody quickly. So, whether it's me calling the plays or Timmy calling the plays, it will always be what's best for the team,"" he said.
Cushing, who retired from the NFL last year, played his entire nine-season career with the Texans. In 104 starts, he had 674 tackles, 13.5 sacks, 9 forced fumbles and an interception. However, he was twice suspended by the NFL for violating the policy against performance-enhancing drugs.
""Brian, obviously, brings so much passion for the Houston Texans,"" O'Brien said. ""I think at the end of careers guys have a hard time. They've played a lot of football, they've played at such a high level. Brian was a Rookie of the Year, he was a Pro Bowl-type player. Brian is the all-time leading tackler for the Houston Texans. I think it's hard. When their playing days are over, it's hard to transition. He wanted to continue to play, but at the end of the day he made a decision that it was time for him to move on to the next stage of his life. He had always expressed an interest to me in wanting to be a coach, possibly in the weight room, help with player development.""
Former Texans backup quarterback T.J. Yates and linebacker Akeem Dent are also joining the coaching staff. Yates, who will be an offensive assistant, hasn't played since the 2017 season, when he appeared in four games for the Texans. Dent, who last played in 2016 for the Texans, will be a defensive assistant.
The Texans also named Carl Smith as the team's quarterbacks coach. He had been the Seahawks' quarterbacks coach since 2011 and was an associate head coach with the team last season. Will Lawing replaces Kelly as the Texans' tight ends coach.
Former wide receiver Wes Welker, who had been an offensive and special-teams assistant with the team the past two seasons, will not return in 2019.

25966875,"The NFL offseason is upon us. Most of the league has spent January thinking about what it's going to do in the player-acquisition period stretching through the end of April, and while the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams are a little behind the pack, I suspect they aren't too upset about having to catch up.
Over the next two weeks, I'm going to detail the first five moves I think every team should make this offseason. I'll begin in the NFC West and work my way east, and then catch up with the AFC next week. Check out the full schedule below:


Tuesday, Feb. 12: NFC West
Wednesday, Feb. 13: NFC South
Thursday, Feb. 14: NFC North
Friday, Feb. 15: NFC East
JUMP TO A TEAM:
NFC East: DAL | NYG | PHI | WSH
NFC North: CHI | DET | GB | MIN
NFC South: ATL | CAR | NO | TB
NFC West: ARI | LAR | SF | SEA
We're going to finish this week with the NFC East, which seemed like a division no team wanted to take home before the Cowboys went on a five-game win streak in November. Dallas has a lot of work to do this offseason to keep its core, while the rest of the division has to deal with quarterback concerns ...
1. Release Sean Lee, Allen Hurns and Terrance Williams. While Lee is a Cowboys icon after nine years with the team, his role as an every-down linebacker was taken by rookie Leighton Vander Esch last season. Lee has a cap hit of $10.8 million, and by cutting these three veterans, Dallas would free up $14.3 million in cap space, pushing it to $59 million in total. After a decade of struggling with their salary cap, the Cowboys are finally in excellent shape.
For a minute or two, at least.
2. Work out an extension with DeMarcus Lawrence. The Cowboys can franchise Lawrence for a second time and will likely do so to ensure he stays in Dallas, but the long-term deal should come this offseason. After Lawrence broke out with 14.5 sacks on 26 knockdowns in 2017, he followed with 10.5 sacks on 23 knockdowns last season. He added eight tackles for loss against the run, which was three off the league-leading 11 produced by Luke Kuechly.
An extension for the soon-to-be-27-year-old Lawrence isn't going to come cheap. His representation likely will try to compare him to Khalil Mack, who produced 21.5 sacks, 48 knockdowns and 29 tackles for loss in his two seasons before signing a six-year, $141 million extension with the Bears at age 27. That one might be a hard sell, in part because Mack's deal is an outlier among edge rushers. His $23.5 million average annual salary is more than $4 million higher than that of any other player at the position.
The Bears had no leverage when they extended Mack -- it's hardly as if they were going to trade two first-rounders in a deal for Mack and then go year to year with him -- but the Cowboys are one year away from an onerous third franchise tag on Lawrence, so they don't have much leverage either. Lawrence has undergone two back surgeries and was suspended for four games in 2016 after violating the league's substance abuse policy, but that's not enough to drive down his price.
The closest comps to Lawrence in terms of situation are likely Chandler Jones and Melvin Ingram, each of whom was franchised and then signed to an extension during the 2017 offseason. The Chargers' Ingram signed a four-year, $66 million deal with $34 million guaranteed at signing and $50 million due in Years 1-3. Jones' five-year, $82.5 million deal guaranteed $31 million at signing but came through with $51 million due in the first three seasons. The structure of Jones' deal with the Cardinals also virtually guaranteed that he would be in line to receive the $51 million.
Lawrence will be looking to top the Jones deal. If we use a 2019 projection of $190 million, the cap will have risen by 13.7 percent between Jones signing his deal and Lawrence signing his. That rise would get Lawrence to $58 million over three years. I agree with Cowboys reporter Todd Archer's assessment and think we might as well go with round numbers. Lawrence's new deal will be somewhere around five years and $100 million, with $60 million due in the first three seasons.
3. Extend Dak Prescott. The final year of Prescott's four-year, $2.7 million deal is 2019, and while there were some concerns that he was regressing during the first half of 2018, his play once Amari Cooper arrived in town did enough to quell most of the discussion about the team letting him leave after his rookie contract expired. A reminder about Prescott after three seasons:
Player B is Carson Wentz, and while I'd still say Wentz is the better quarterback, those numbers don't include Prescott's edge as a rusher and the fact that he has stayed healthy. The Eagles are going to extend Wentz, as I'll get to in this piece. I don't see a strong case for the Cowboys passing on Prescott. After Dallas missed out on Paxton Lynch and Connor Cook before settling for Prescott, I wouldn't trust Jerry Jones & Co. to go back into the quarterback market.
There are three comps for Prescott in contract negotiations, given that he started three full seasons as a non-first-rounder under the current CBA. One is Andy Dalton, who signed a six-year, $96 million extension in 2014 but one that guaranteed him only $17 million at signing while allowing the Bengals to go year to year. Dalton is entering the fifth year of that deal now, but I doubt Prescott would be willing to take that sort of contract structure.
The second is former third-round pick Russell Wilson, who was the closest to Prescott in terms of salary. Months before his fourth season began in 2015, Wilson signed a four-year, $87.6 million extension with $31.7 million guaranteed at signing and $56.6 million due the first three seasons. Wilson, again, isn't a perfect comp here; he won a Super Bowl during his rookie contract and floated a spurious idea about going to play baseball, which didn't go far. The Seahawks also prefer relatively short extensions, while the Cowboys are more likely to give Prescott one of their six-year specials for cap reasons.
The final comp -- and perhaps the most accurate of the three -- is Derek Carr. The Raiders quarterback followed a career year at age 25 by signing a five-year, $125 million extension in 2017. The deal guaranteed Carr $40 million at signing with $67.5 million due the first three seasons. It was also basically structured in a way that would allow Oakland to easily move on from him after three years if he didn't work out. Jon Gruden's Raiders don't have cap concerns, given their lack of talent, but they will be able to get out of Carr's deal after 2019 with just $5 million in dead money.
Wilson and Carr ended up with roughly similar deals through three years. When you build in the expected rise in the cap when they signed their respective deals, Wilson's contract amounted to 12.4 percent of the cap through three years, while Carr was at 12.7 percent. Build that same idea for Prescott and you get something in the ballpark of $77 million over the first three seasons of his new deal. Round up to $78 million and you get Prescott to $26 million per year the first three seasons. Six years and somewhere around $160 million would be a starting point for his extension.
4. Re-sign Amari Cooper, and get him some help. Of course the Cowboys are going to re-sign Cooper after he transformed their offense in 2018. He won't turn 25 until June, and though his numbers fell off during his final season and a half in Oakland, his Cowboys numbers prorate to a 94-1,289-10 line, which would be a natural growth progression from his 2015 and 2016 seasons.
Cooper hasn't yet had the sort of massive season we've seen from Mike Evans and Odell Beckham Jr., each of whom signed an extension as he entered his fifth-year option season, which Cooper will hit in 2019. The best comparison might be Brandin Cooks, who signed a five-year, $81 million extension in July. Cooks had only $20.5 million guaranteed at signing, but his double-dip bonus structure left him with $50.5 million in practical guarantees and $42 million in new money in Years 1-3.
Cooper is due $13.9 million for his fifth-year option, so a new deal would likely need to get Cooper to $56 million in Years 1-3, which would conveniently top the $55 million Evans got in his deal. A five-year, $87 million extension would get Cooper to the $100 million mark over six years when you factor in that fifth-year option.
If the Cowboys are cutting Hurns and Williams and letting Cole Beasley leave in free agency, they'll be in the market for a receiver to play alongside Cooper and Michael Gallup. Cooper has had success in the slot the past two seasons, so a pure slot receiver might not be the ideal solution, but there are plenty of options out there if Dallas wants to go in that direction. Wideouts such as Jamison Crowder and Adam Humphries could be an upgrade on Beasley, who turns 30 in April. It wouldn't be a surprise to see the Cowboys add one of them. Danny Amendola, who grew up outside Houston before going to Texas Tech, would also make sense if he's a cap casualty in Miami.
5. Work on a deal for Byron Jones. If the Cowboys get all of the above done, they can take things slowly with Jones, who emerged as a star only last season after shuffling between corner and safety. Jones' fifth-year option is a relatively modest $6.3 million, which is a bargain for a talented cornerback in the modern NFL. If the Cowboys don't need to use their franchise tag for any of the players mentioned previously, they could theoretically go year to year with Jones, franchise him twice and pay only $45 million or so over the next three seasons. That's just about what Trumaine Johnson got from the Jets in free agency last year.
Jones' closest comp is Kyle Fuller, who was basically written off as a bust before an impressive 2017. He  was hit with the transition tag by the Bears before signing a four-year, $56 million offer sheet with the Packers, which the Bears instantly matched. Jones was a Pro Bowler last season, though, while Fuller didn't make the Pro Bowl until after signing his deal in 2018. Jones might command more of a premium than Fuller did on the free market.

If the Cowboys wanted to re-up Jones, they probably would be looking at something in the range of four years and $64 million. If they opt for a longer extension, his new deal might top the five-year, $75 million standard-bearer Josh Norman signed with Washington back in 2016. The Cowboys aren't going to have much cap space once these deals are up, but they won't complain if their core continues to play the way it did in 2018.
1. Franchise Landon Collins. The Giants are still recovering from years of subpar drafts under former GM Jerry Reese. The only players left on the roster from a five-year stretch of Reese drafts between 2011 and '15 are Collins and Odell Beckham Jr. Losing Collins, one of the few young building blocks the Giants have on defense, would be a step backward for a team that already has plenty of problems on offense.

2. Move on from Eli Manning, and acquire a veteran to replace him. As the Manning Farewell Tour stretches into its third year, it remains to be seen what it will take for the Giants to quit their longtime starting quarterback. Manning's numbers superficially rose last season -- he posted a career-high completion percentage of 66.0 and the fourth-best passer rating of his career (92.4) -- but the two-time Super Bowl MVP's Total QBR was a middling 51.6, ranking 25th out of 33 qualifying passers.
His raw numbers were less impressive than they might seem. By ESPN's expected points metric, 30.3 percent of his completions did not push the Giants closer to scoring points, the highest rate in the league among passers with 400 attempts. His average completion traveled just 5.6 yards in the air, the 25th-highest rate in the league. Manning also spent a significant chunk of the season throwing in garbage time. He threw 90 passes on drives that started with the Giants holding no more than a 1 percent chance of winning the game, third most in the NFL behind Kirk Cousins and Matt Ryan.
On top of all this, Manning is making $23 million in the final season on his contract, a salary he would not come close to hitting on the open market. His jersey might as well have ""INERTIA"" on the back. Manning is a Giants legend and deserves to be applauded for the role he played in two Super Bowl victories. He doesn't deserve to be unceremoniously benched midseason, as he was during the 2017 campaign, for Geno Smith. But the Giants need to be realistic about their future, which doesn't involve Manning. They can free up $17 million in much-needed cap space by moving on from him.
I'd figure that New York would follow up by going after a starter, though it depends on who's available on the market. While he lacks the Giants' preferred height, Case Keenum excelled under Pat Shurmur's tutelage during his breakout 2017 season in Minnesota. He's also likely to come relatively cheap, given that the Broncos have little financial reason for keeping the Houston product after trading for Joe Flacco earlier this week.
3. Draft Dwayne Haskins with the No. 6 overall pick. If the Giants don't want to take Kyler Murray because he's under 6 feet, they won't have the same concerns about the 6-foot-3 Ohio State passer. He produced the third-best Total QBR in college football last season at 86.3, trailing only that of Murray (95.8) and Tua Tagovailoa (93.2). Haskins has the physical traits you would want from a quarterback coming out of school, and he was given a first-round grade by the NFL draft advisory board.
The concern with Haskins is inexperience, given that the 21-year-old spent only one year as a starter and threw 590 passes in school. There are similarities to Mitchell Trubisky, who started one season at North Carolina and threw 572 passes before entering the 2017 draft. Trubisky's inconsistency as a passer from drive to drive and game to game speaks to the difficulties a quarterback with that sort of inexperience can have adjusting to the professional level.
Any team taking Haskins should be prepared to let him sit for a full season and develop, but as we've seen with the vast majority of first-round picks, that's unlikely to happen. A combination of Keenum and Haskins would give the Giants a competent passer in the short term and a high-upside prospect for the future.

4. Sign Mike Iupati. The Giants want to be a run-heavy team under GM Dave Gettleman's stewardship, regardless of who lines up at quarterback. His moves to shore up the offensive line last year were mostly disastrous. Big-ticket free agent Nate Solder allowed eight sacks, per Stats LLC, while the right side of the line started the year in New York and finished it in Jacksonville, as the Giants cut both Patrick Omameh and Ereck Flowers. Center Jon Halapio broke his ankle. At least Solder and rookie guard Will Hernandez improved during the second half of the campaign and began to develop a rapport.
The Giants have a hole at right guard with waiver-wire pickup Jamon Brown a free agent, and while Iupati's tenure with the Cardinals was a mess, there's still physicality and talent there in the running game. A one-year flier could give Iupati a shot to prove he's still a starting-caliber NFL guard.
5. Add help at corner. The Giants thought they were set for years at corner when they signed Janoris Jenkins and used a first-round pick on Eli Apple, but after a disastrous 2017 season, they traded Apple to the Saints in October. Apple quickly stepped into the starting lineup and played well for a playoff team, while the Giants started B.W. Webb and undrafted rookie Grant Haley alongside Jenkins for the second half of the season.

Webb is a free agent, and while Haley didn't completely drown as the team's nickel corner, it would be a huge stretch to count on him as a starter in 2019. Investing in a cornerback to play across from Jenkins is the quickest way the Giants can improve a pass defense that ranked 26th in DVOA last season. The Giants could opt for LSU corner Greedy Williams if they pass on a quarterback in the first round, but it wouldn't be a surprise to see them add a veteran such as Bashaud Breeland in free agency before drafting a corner in the second or fourth round.
1. Let Nick Foles leave in free agency. For sentimental and practical reasons, the most appropriate way for the Eagles to handle Foles, who bought out his 2019 option, is to let him hit the free market when the new league year begins in March.
I don't think the option of franchising and trading Foles is particularly appealing in this scenario. To start, it's technically illegal, given that the collective bargaining agreement requires teams to franchise players as part of good faith negotiations to play for the organization in the upcoming season. There is no realistic expectation that Foles would play out the franchise tag in 2019 as the Eagles' backup quarterback. The Patriots were able to get away with this when they franchised Matt Cassel before dealing him to the Chiefs in 2008, so I think the Eagles might not be penalized if they attempt the tag-and-trade, but you can imagine how much of a mess might be made if Foles gets traded to a team he doesn't want to join.
Financially, franchising Foles would force the Eagles to make several other roster moves. Philly is somewhere around $4 million under the cap after convincing Rodney McLeod to take a pay cut. If the Eagles franchise Foles, they'll immediately add his franchise-tag figure -- something in the ballpark of $25 million -- and go well over the salary cap, regardless of where it ends up.
The Eagles would then need to create about $21 million in room before the league year begins March 13, even if they intend to trade Foles at the first moment of the league year. They could theoretically pull that off, but it would involve either cutting contributors or restructuring deals to create short-term cap room at the expense of space down the line. Yes, the Eagles could cut Jason Peters, Tim Jernigan and Nelson Agholor to free up the space needed to temporarily franchise Foles, but that would open another can of worms.
The benefits of trading Foles as opposed to letting the Super Bowl LII MVP pick his next destination aren't as clear as they might seem. The Eagles are capped out and unlikely to spend much in free agency, so there's a good chance they'll recoup a third-round compensatory pick in 2020 when Foles leaves.
Everyone in the league knows that the Eagles don't have much leverage if they franchise Foles, so the offers aren't going to be for much more than that third-round pick. It won't be a first-rounder. Even if we want to believe that GM Howie Roseman can nab a second-rounder in the 2019 draft, is it worth Philly contorting the cap situation and/or shedding starters just so the Eagles can get a pick one round higher and one year earlier?
I might also argue that if anybody has earned the right to pick his new team, it's Foles. The guy is practically a folk hero in Philadelphia. Yes, there's a chance he could go play for the Giants or Washington and face his old teammates twice a year if he hits free agency. The Eagles once traded Donovan McNabb within their own division, and that worked out fine. Foles was a mess in his time in St. Louis with the Rams. It might be a boon for the Eagles if Foles is asked to carry a middling division rival to the playoffs.

Stranger things have happened, but the logical thing for Philadelphia to do is let Foles leave the organization without a franchise tag. My suspicion is that he'll be back with the Eagles later in his career.
2. Move on from Peters, and negotiate a new deal with Jernigan. With four starters hitting free agency in Brandon Graham, Ronald Darby, Jay Ajayi and Jordan Hicks (and the likes of Darren Sproles, Corey Graham, Golden Tate and Mike Wallace joining them), the Eagles have to be flexible this offseason. There's no way they can bring most of those players back, given the cap situation. Roseman could go on a restructuring spree, but the Eagles are going to trust their ability to draft and develop young talent.
To try to create some breathing room, though, the Eagles might have to move on from a franchise icon. Peters just turned 37, and though he was still a useful left tackle, Halapoulivaati Vaitai was impressive during Philadelphia's run to the Super Bowl, while Peters was recovering from a torn ACL and MCL. The Eagles could decline Peters' 2019 option and likely net another compensatory pick in 2020. They also could ask Peters to take a pay cut, but that's something the veteran declined to do in 2017.
Cutting or trading Peters would free $8 million in cap room. The Eagles could create another $7 million in space by releasing Jernigan, who missed most of 2018 while recovering from back surgery. Jernigan is a useful player when healthy, and releasing him would leave Philly thin at defensive tackle behind Fletcher Cox, but this is a deep draft for defensive linemen, and the Eagles should be able to mine the players cut by teams in March to replenish their depth. Jernigan is not going to get the three years and $35 million left on his deal in free agency, so a pay cut as part of a restructure might make sense for both sides.
3. Wait out the market on Graham and Hicks. I thought there was an approximately zero percent chance that the Eagles would have found a way to bring back Nigel Bradham last year, but when he didn't get a multiyear pact in free agency, the Eagles were able to carve out room to re-sign him. The linebacker's five-year, $40 million contract is really a two-year, $13.9 million deal with some extra seasons tacked on for cap purposes, but it was still an unexpected bonus for Philly.
The team might get lucky with two other defensive starters this time around. Graham was underrated for most of his career (including, for several seasons, by the Eagles themselves), but he had his best season in 2017. He has been a good run defender, but he added 9.5 sacks and chipped in that famous strip sack of Tom Brady in the Super Bowl.
Teams aren't beholden to sack totals, but Graham racked up only four sacks as part of Philly's defensive end rotation in 2018. He turns 31 in April, and in an offseason in which both the free-agent class and the draft are full of edge-rushing options, his market might not develop the way that it seems. If it doesn't, the Eagles could justify bringing back Graham on a similar two-year pact to the one signed by Bradham.
Hicks is another talented Eagles draftee, but he plays a middle linebacker spot that hasn't typically been the source of significant free-agent deals, last offseason aside. After the Texas product racked up eight takeaways (seven interceptions and a forced fumble) in his first two NFL seasons, he hasn't recorded any in his two most recent campaigns. Hicks has also struggled to stay healthy, as he missed 21 games in his first four seasons. It wouldn't shock me if he found a multiyear deal on the market, but if he slips through the cracks, the Eagles should consider bringing him back.
4. Find a new backup quarterback. Carson Wentz is eligible for a contract extension, and the Eagles have been aggressive with handing players early extensions going back through the Joe Banner era, but I'd hold off on extending Wentz until next offseason. He has an $8.5 million cap hit in 2019, and while the Eagles could structure a new deal in a way that doesn't dramatically impact that number, there's no reason to rush into a deal. Philly is not going to save much on a Wentz extension, regardless of when it happens, and he isn't going anywhere.
At the same time, the Eagles can't afford to be cheap behind Wentz, who has missed 13 games in his first three seasons when you include Foles' five playoff starts. They need a passer with some pedigree behind Wentz, and while restricted free agent Nate Sudfeld has shown some promise, the Eagles can't feel confident that they're one false step away from pinning their hopes on the former Indiana starter.
Because Philadelphia wants to protect its Foles compensatory pick, it is probably going to sift through quarterbacks cut by other teams to identify a veteran backup. It seems like a safe bet that Blake Bortles will be part of that class, but a handful of other passers are still up in the air. Ryan Tannehill? Eli Manning? Case Keenum? Blaine Gabbert? I don't need to tell you that list doesn't seem very exciting, but then again, Foles was a mess with the Rams in 2015 and nearly left football before delivering one unimpressive spot start (albeit with impressive stats) during his year with the Chiefs in 2016. I would guess that one of those passers will be backing up Wentz in 2019.
5. Acquire a starting running back. The Eagles clearly don't want to invest in a significant salary for their primary halfback, which is smart and borne out by data. They've gotten by the past two years by paying peanuts to free agents without a market (LeGarrette Blount) and buying low on players via trade (Ajayi). In 2018, the Eagles cycled through five backs thanks to injuries before settling on Wendell Smallwood in the postseason.

Ajayi and Sproles are both free agents, and while the Eagles will return Corey Clement and Josh Adams alongside Smallwood, they should be targeting another back to take over as their primary ball carrier this offseason. That will most likely come via the draft, though they could pursue trade targets such as Alex Collins and Kenyan Drake.
1. Proceed as if Alex Smith isn't coming back. There's no reason to fault Washington for the Smith trade and extension, both of which made sense last year. Nobody could have anticipated what might happen next. Smith's broken leg and the infection that followed have compromised his career. Washington is privy to much better medical information than I am, but it's only realistic to wonder whether Smith will ever return to the field at all, let alone at anything resembling 100 percent.
There's nothing Washington can do about Smith's contract, which is guaranteed for injury through 2020. Assuming he attempts to make a comeback, the team will owe Smith a $15 million base salary in 2019 (with a $20.4 million cap hit) and a $16 million base salary in 2020 ($21.4 million cap charge) before eating $10.8 million of dead money in 2021. If Smith were to retire after 2019, Washington would get out of that $16 million base salary, but it would still owe $16.2 million in dead money for 2020. There's no good way to deal with this.
Sadly, Washington has to treat the Smith deal as a sunk cost and work on finding a quarterback solution. Colt McCoy has one year left on his deal at a base salary of $3 million, and you would figure the organization has faith in him to serve as the primary backup at a minimum. Washington could go with McCoy as the starter and draft a possible replacement, but McCoy was injured in his second start replacing Smith. The solution has to be McCoy and a first-round pick or McCoy and a veteran with starting experience.
2. Cut Zach Brown. After giving the inside linebacker a series of one-year deals, Washington finally signed Brown to a multiyear contract last offseason, only to sour on him during the season. Brown played just 101 defensive snaps in the final month, as Washington benched him during the Week 14 loss to the Giants. He's still a useful player, but Washington needs cap space if it is going to add a veteran quarterback. Cutting Brown would free up $5.8 million.
3. Extend Brandon Scherff. The fifth overall pick in the 2015 draft has rounded into form as one of the NFL's best guards. The only concern with Scherff is injury; he missed two games in 2017 before a torn pectoral cost him the second half of the 2018 season. Washington would be foolish to pass on extending its star guard, and in doing so it can reduce Scherff's $12.5 million cap hit for 2019.
It's going to be costly. Scherff doesn't quite have Zack Martin's r√©sum√©, but with the $12.5 million already owed, his contract is going to be Martin-sized. A five-year, $75 million extension would get Scherff over Martin's average annual salary ($14 million) and total compensation ($84 million over six years). I would start talking about how much it would cost for Washington to go year to year with the franchise tag, but let's just say the team already learned that lesson.
4. Bring back Adrian Peterson. Although Washington turned to Peterson only after rookie Derrius Guice went down with a torn ACL during preseason, the future Hall of Fame back delivered a productive, healthy season for just over $1 million. Guice will be back, and he might be Washington's running back of the future, but Peterson was a good fit and deserves a role in the offense. A raise to $3.5 million would make sense.
5. Find help at safety. What looked like a strength for Washington a few months ago is suddenly a weakness. The trade for Ha Ha Clinton-Dix didn't take, as the former Packers standout struggled after immediately being inserted into the lineup. It's likely he'll land somewhere else in free agency.
Washington also cut D.J. Swearinger in December, as the organization was fed up with Swearinger's comments about the team's struggles. It was a typically shortsighted move given that Swearinger was one of the team's best players in 2018. Although he was frustrating early in his career, he has rounded into one of the league's better safeties. Fellow safety Montae Nicholson was arrested in December and charged with assault and battery and being drunk in public and might be facing league discipline.


On top of all that, Washington clearly doesn't have much money to spend to fix the position. A repeat of last year's cratering safety market would help Jay Gruden & Co., though the most likely source for new blood at the position will be the draft. Washington likely will have an extra third-round pick via the comp-pick system as a result of losing Kirk Cousins, and it would hardly be a shock if the franchise used one of those third-rounders on a safety.
Let's hit the NFC North, where the Bears made a (somewhat) surprising run from worst to first, while the rest of the division collapsed. The Packers fired their coach, and the Lions and Vikings both moved on from their offensive coordinators. Can anyone catch up with the league's best defense?
1. Find a meaningful competitor for Cody Parkey. Even if Parkey's missed kick in the wild-card game was actually tipped by an Eagles defender, it's difficult to imagine the embattled Bears kicker having a real future in Chicago. Going on the ""Today"" show to discuss the miss seemed to irritate much of the organization, and the crowd is going to turn on Parkey the first time he misses a kick at home in 2019.
The ideal replacement would be beloved former Bears kicker Robbie Gould, but he might not want to return to the organization that cut him in 2016, and the 49ers could put the franchise tag on their 36-year-old stalwart. The Bears signed Redford Jones to a reserve contract, but they have every reason to target a veteran such as Matt Bryant or Cairo Santos. The Bears will have to eat $5.1 million in dead money to cut Parkey, but he represents a sunk cost at this point.
2. Pick between Bryce Callahan and Adrian Amos. The only two notable free agents for the Bears are in the secondary, where Amos has quietly rounded into an above-average starter amid the unmissable playmaking ability of fellow safety Eddie Jackson. The depressed safety market from the 2018 offseason and the presence of bigger names such as Earl Thomas, Lamarcus Joyner, Tyrann Mathieu and Ha Ha Clinton-Dix could keep Amos' price down.
At corner, meanwhile, Callahan built upon an underrated 2017 season with an even more impressive 2018, before going down with a broken foot in Week 14, which ended his season. Callahan benefited from playing on an excellent defense at multiple levels, but it's also telling that the winning touchdown pass from the Eagles in that postseason tilt was thrown to Golden Tate against Sherrick McManis, who was Callahan's replacement in the slot.
Of the two, I think the Bears probably will end up re-signing Amos. They've already committed serious money to their two outside cornerbacks in Kyle Fuller and Prince Amukamara, who will have a combined $23 million cap hit in 2019. The cornerback market is thinner than the safety market, which will make Callahan more of a precious commodity. Callahan also hasn't managed to complete a full 16-game season as a pro, and he has missed 16 games because of injury over his four seasons in Chicago.
3. Sit out free agency. The Bears are missing their first- and second-round picks as part of the Khalil Mack and Anthony Miller trades, respectively. In 2020, they'll send their first- and third-round picks to what will then be Las Vegas, although the Raiders will send their second-round pick back to Chicago. Nobody in Chicago is complaining about the Mack trade after last season, but the Bears are missing a lot of draft capital.
They should do what they can to try to generate compensatory picks over the next couple of years, and while it's tempting to try to go all-in for that one last missing piece, that move rarely pays off. If they lose Callahan, they should be able to recoup a fourth-round compensatory pick for their departed cornerback. When you consider that the Bears drafted Jackson and Tarik Cohen in the fourth round in 2017, a compensatory fourth-rounder might turn out to be a valuable asset.
One signing or trade can dictate several more moves. Let's lay out destinations for seven potential free agents, then predict what comes next.

So long, 2018 season. It's never too early to look ahead to 2019. Our crew of insiders weighs in on the biggest topics of the offseason.
4. Cut Dion Sims. The Bears have just under $6 million in cap space after re-signing Bobby Massie, so they probably want to clear out a little room to fill out the back of their roster, especially with those missing picks. Sims has value as a blocking tight end, but his $6 million cap hit isn't in line with what similar players such as Michael Hoomanawanui will make in free agency. Sims played only 17.9 percent of Chicago's snaps last season, and that was with Adam Shaheen missing most of the season. The Bears can free up $5.7 million by releasing the former Dolphins draftee.

5. Find a 2020 replacement for Jordan Howard. While Howard excelled during his rookie campaign in 2016 and has been a productive running back, his efficiency metrics have fallen throughout his career. Howard averaged 5.1 yards per carry and posted a 49 percent success rate as a rookie. In 2017, he averaged 4.1 yards per rush, and his success rate fell to 42 percent, which was 35th in the league. Last season, while Howard's success rate popped back up to 50 percent, he averaged just 3.7 yards per carry.
Cohen is the running back who really seems to excel in this offense, although consistency is a problem for the 23-year-old. Chicago should likely expect Howard to move on after the 2019 season, and it should start looking for a back to shoulder his half of the workload as early as this April.
1. Cut T.J. Lang and Glover Quin. The move to sign Lang simply hasn't worked out due to injuries, as the former Packers standout has missed 13 games over the past two seasons with an assortment of ailments. Lang is still an effective player, but after suffering his fifth concussion in 2018 and finishing the season on injured reserve with a neck injury, it's unclear whether Lang wants to continue his career. It's difficult to see him coming back at his $11.5 million cap number under any circumstance.
As for Quin, the 33-year-old safety hasn't been the difference-maker we saw earlier in his career with the Lions. Again, in a market full of talented free safeties one year after the league seemed disinterested in the position during free agency, Quin's $7.9 million cap hit is probably out of line with what he would get on the open market. A pay cut could make sense if Quin wants to stick around, but he would likely be looking at a one-year deal for less than $3 million if Detroit decides to move on.
Cutting Lang and Quin would get Detroit to about $45 million in cap space, and the Lions could get to over $50 million by releasing Nevin Lawson and trading Teez Tabor, neither of whom have emerged as a reliable corner next to Darius Slay. Editor's note: The Lions cut Quin on Friday, Feb. 15.
2. Find a starting corner. About that, actually ... the Lions are still trying to find a second cornerback to play alongside their Pro Bowl starter. D.J. Hayden didn't impress. Lawson can't stop committing penalties, as his 11 flags from a year ago were second in the league, behind Robert Alford. Tabor, a second-round pick in 2017, was a healthy scratch in four games last season, and it wasn't because the Lions were getting great play at corner.
It's probably too early to give up on Tabor, but the Lions can't depend on him to suddenly blossom into a starting corner after two wildly disappointing seasons. Detroit needs to find a solution, and the options in free agency aren't exactly sure things. The Lions would be taking a major risk by spending $10 million or more per season on a player like Ronald Darby.
More plausibly, the Lions will pursue a corner in the draft. They've been popularly linked to LSU corner Greedy Williams with the eighth overall pick, and while they might prefer to add pass-rushing help, Williams would address an issue that has flummoxed the team for years.
3. Go all-in for Trey Flowers. The options at edge rusher in free agency are more promising, even if you assume that DeMarcus Lawrence, Jadeveon Clowney, Dee Ford and Frank Clark are all likely to be franchised. The Lions got 14.5 combined sacks from former Giants Romeo Okwara and Devon Kennard, but with Ezekiel Ansah all but sure to leave Detroit, they need to add a No. 1 pass-rusher.
The obvious match here is with Flowers, whom Matt Patricia coached in New England. The Patriots don't seem likely to franchise Flowers, and with a trickier cap situation, Detroit general manager Bob Quinn can comfortably outbid his former employer for their best pass-rusher. The price tag might be shocking -- Flowers could very well hit five years and $80 million -- but the 25-year-old has 17 sacks on 61 knockdowns over the past two regular seasons and postseasons. The 45 percent rule suggests Flowers would typically have produced about 27 sacks over that time frame given his knockdown total, so it wouldn't shock me to see Flowers take another step forward in 2019, regardless of where he ends up.
4. Draft a tight end. The ideal scenario for the Lions would be to draft Williams in the first round and follow up with a tight end in Round 2, given that the only tight ends left on the roster are Michael Roberts and Jerome Cunningham. The tight end pool in free agency isn't very enticing, but this looks to be a deep draft for tight ends, with three placing among the top 30 prospects in Scouts Inc.'s rankings. Rookie tight ends generally aren't very productive, but the Lions might be able to find a plug-and-play starter such as Irv Smith Jr. at No. 43.

5. Grab a slot receiver. Detroit won't use a slot receiver as frequently as it transitions from Jim Bob Cooter to new offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell, but it still needs to add someone capable of working in the slot to replace the lost production from Golden Tate. A reunion with Tate, given his likely price tag in free agency, doesn't seem likely.

If we look toward former Patriots, one possible candidate would be Danny Amendola, who is likely to be released by a rebuilding Dolphins team given a lofty cap hit. Another low-cost option would be Jermaine Kearse, who caught 26 of his 37 passes a year ago out of the slot. If the Lions want to go into a higher tax bracket, they could look at Adam Humphries or former Packers standout Randall Cobb, who is still just 28. Quinn also should have an instinct for finding slot receivers after spending time in New England, where it's an entry-level course for personnel executives.
1. Let Clay Matthews leave. A few years ago, I wrote about the hometown premium, where a player who has spent a long time making significant money at one stop might construe an offer from that team as insulting, even if it reflects his actual market.
I suspect the hometown premium could pop up with Matthews this offseason. The six-time Pro Bowler just finished a five-year, $66 million extension that didn't live up to expectations. In the five seasons before the extension, Matthews produced 50 sacks and 106 quarterback knockdowns. Over the five seasons covering that extension, Matthews generated 33.5 sacks and 83 hits. Matthews moved to inside linebacker for stretches of that extension, and he should be applauded for his versatility, but the reality is also that inside linebackers don't typically get paid in free agency in the way that edge rushers do.
Matthews is still a useful player, of course, and he'll have a market if the Packers don't re-sign him. But in a year in which there are plenty of other edge-rushing options in free agency and at the top of the draft, Matthews is probably looking at something in the yearly range of $5 million to $6 million if he goes to a contender.
2. Bring back Muhammad Wilkerson. The former Jets standout impressed with the Packers before going down with a broken ankle in Week 3. He had signed a one-year deal to try to rebuild his value after a disappointing end to his tenure in New York, and after the ankle injury, he likely is going to be staring down another prove-it deal. The Packers should give him a second chance to do that.
3. Bring in a free safety. The Packers traded Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to Washington and moved Tramon Williams to free safety last season. But even if you think Williams played well in his new role, he will turn 36 in March, and he can't be considered a long-term solution. Williams also has a $6.4 million cap hold, and the Packers could release the veteran to free up $4.8 million and get to $39 million in space.
The free safety market is full of options this offseason, and if GM Brian Gutekunst wants to make a return foray into unrestricted free agency, the Packers could viably add someone like Tyrann Mathieu or Lamarcus Joyner. Mathieu's playmaking ability seems particularly tantalizing for a defense that ranked 30th in interceptions per drive last season.
4. Use one of the first-round picks to draft an edge rusher. If the Packers let Matthews go, they'll run into 2019 with Kyler Fackrell and Nick Perry as their edge defenders. It's tough to think they're going to be a great duo next season.
Perry had just 1.5 sacks in nine games, and he hasn't yet completed a full 16-game campaign as a pro.
Fackrell came out of nowhere to produce 10.5 sacks, but those sacks came on just 12 quarterback hits. Typically, pass-rushers will turn about 45 percent of their hits into sacks, and players who dramatically outproduce that rate tend to decline the following year. Fackrell cleaned up on a few coverage sacks and had three sacks in which he narrowly tripped or pulled an opposing quarterback down as he passed by. Two of his sacks came against backup linemen in for injured starters. Six of his sacks came against Josh Allen and Russell Wilson, two of the league's most sackable quarterbacks -- and passers Fackrell won't see in 2019. Fackrell did have more impressive sacks -- he even picked one up against Andrew Whitworth -- but it's unlikely he'll get to double digits again in 2019.
The first round of this draft is full of front-seven pieces, and the Packers have two first-round picks after trading down with the Saints last year. Green Bay isn't in position to draft someone like Nick Bosa, but with the 12th and 30th picks, the Packers should be able to come away with at least one impact pass-rusher to replace Matthews.
5. Add at least one wide receiver. Davante Adams was targeted 169 times last season, the second-highest total in the league, behind Julio Jones. The Packers might have the worst receiving corps in football if Adams were to go down injured, as their starting wideouts would become Geronimo Allison, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Equanimeous St. Brown. Those are three young wideouts who each flashed for a game or two in 2018, but Allison was undrafted, Valdes-Scantling was a fifth-round pick and St. Brown was a sixth-rounder. The Packers need to invest in a second wideout with Randall Cobb leaving town.

The free-agent wideout class isn't exactly appealing, although it sure seems like Golden Tate would be able to develop an easy rapport with Aaron Rodgers out of the slot. Jamison Crowder also could make sense at a cheaper price point. Using one of their four top-75 picks on a wide receiver might be more plausible. Going into the season with something beyond Adams and hope at wide receiver is critical.
1. Extend Sheldon Richardson. The Vikings have some tough choices to make on defense, thanks in part to the fact that Kirk Cousins has a $29 million cap hit in 2019, the third highest in football. There's also no way to meaningfully restructure Cousins' deal, so the Vikings basically have to let it ride and make cost savings elsewhere.
One player I wouldn't let go of, though, is Richardson. The 28-year-old had another above-average season as an interior disruptor in his debut with the Vikings, racking up 4.5 sacks and 16 knockdowns -- second on the team behind Danielle Hunter's 19. Hunter managed an unsustainable 14.5 sacks on his 19 knockdowns, so it would be reasonable to expect some regression from him in 2019.
As a defensive tackle, Richardson's franchise tag figure is projected to land somewhere around $15.4 million, nearly double the one-year, $8 million deal he signed with the Vikings after leaving Seattle last offseason. He is likely not going to get that on the free market.
Something close to the five-year, $50 million deal that Star Lotulelei signed with the Bills last year makes more sense. Richardson could join his fourth team in four seasons this March, but for something in the range of $10 million per year, both sides could be satisfied with extending his stay in Minnesota.
2. Let Anthony Barr leave and negotiate with Everson Griffen. Barr will have one of the more fascinating markets in the league as a rangy outside linebacker without the sort of pass-rushing numbers we typically associate with highly paid front-seven pieces. I'm confident some team is going to give Barr a deal north of $10 million per season, but after re-signing Hunter and Eric Kendricks last year, it's probably not going to be the Vikings.
With just $5.8 million in cap space even before re-signing Richardson, the Vikings will have to create room to fill out their roster by shedding at least one large salary. The most plausible move would be to cut Griffen, who left the team in September while struggling with his mental state, then returned in October. Griffen, 31, is still an effective player, but Stephen Weatherly played well in Griffen's absence, and Minnesota would create $10.5 million in cap space by releasing their three-time Pro Bowl end.
The Vikings could instead ask Griffen to take a pay cut or keep him around for another season. If they hold onto Griffen, they could create a similar amount of space by releasing the duo of Andrew Sendejo and Mike Remmers, but the Vikings are weaker at safety and along their offensive line than they are at defensive end.
3. Rework the offensive line ... again. Let's get to Remmers here. One of the many spring pursuits we see as Minneapolis thaws out is GM Rick Spielman reconfiguring the Vikings' offensive line, a unit that has improved and declined in almost perfect harmony with the Vikings' broader success over the past five seasons.
Let's try to narrow down the game of musical chairs. Third-year center Pat Elflein is going to stay at the pivot. Brian O'Neill, a second-round pick in 2018 who impressed at right tackle in his rookie season, is penciled in to start there again in 2019. Rashod Hill started the season at right tackle, but he's probably Minnesota's swing tackle in 2019. Remmers, who originally was signed to play right tackle, moved to right guard in 2017 before struggling mightily last season; he is likely to be released, which would free up $4.6 million in cap space.
We're left with three spots in the starting lineup, one of which will go to Riley Reiff. Which one? If you believe the rumors, it might be left guard. In a familiar story, the Vikings signed Reiff to play left tackle, but after two seasons, they think Reiff might be a better fit on the interior. His arms have been a concern going back to his time at Iowa; the Lions drafted Reiff to play left tackle, but after four years on Matthew Stafford's blind side, Detroit drafted Taylor Decker and moved Reiff to the right side.
Reiff isn't the prototypical left tackle, but do the Vikings have a better option? They can't afford to go out and sign Trent Brown in free agency. The 6-foot-6 Hill is massive, but there have been no signs he can play left tackle at the NFL level. It looks like the Vikings will hope to draft one of the tackles with a first-round grade at the 18th spot while simultaneously moving Reiff to guard, but even that would be turning over one of the most important positions in the lineup to a debuting player.
We haven't even touched on who might replace Remmers at guard, and that's in a market where there really isn't much talent available at the position. The Vikings could sign a center like Matt Paradis and move Elflein to guard, but that's a whole other can of worms. Let's just say the line is going to look a lot different in May than it does now.
4. Explore the trade market for Trae Waynes. One other way to free up space would be to move on from Waynes, who has a $9.1 million cap hold for his fifth-year option. Consistency was an issue earlier in his Vikings tenure, but he has grown steadier and become less of an obvious target for opposing quarterbacks. From what I saw, Waynes was only the primary defender on one touchdown in 2018, when the Rams isolated Waynes against Brandin Cooks for a 47-yard score, and even that took a great throw from Jared Goff.
Are the Vikings likely to sign Waynes to an extension, though? It's a tough call. He will be hitting free agency in 2020 as a 27-year-old who looks to be a very solid No. 2 corner, if not a true shutdown top-tier player. Those guys can get paid: Malcolm Butler picked up a five-year, $61.3 million deal last offseason, and it was coming off of a disappointing 2017 season and that infamous benching in the Super Bowl. If Waynes plays the same way he did in 2018, some team is going to give him an even larger deal in 2020 than Butler's.
It's difficult to picture the Vikings paying that sort of money, given their cap constraints and roster construction. Xavier Rhodes had a disappointing 2018 while battling through injuries, and he is two years older than Waynes, but the Florida State product has shown a far higher ceiling than his younger successor. Mike Zimmer places a priority on drafting and developing young corners, and he appears to have found a gem in 2018 first-rounder Mike Hughes, who was impressive before going down with a torn ACL. If Hughes' rehab goes well, he would likely step in for Waynes in the starting lineup if Waynes leaves.
The Vikings could keep Waynes around for one more season before letting him hit free agency, but teams such as the Patriots and Rams have shown the value in going after players with cost-controlled years left on their rookie deals, and a lot of teams need cornerback help. This isn't a great cornerback market in free agency, either, so one year with Waynes and a comp pick might be preferable to a multiyear deal on Ronald Darby or Bradley Roby.
One logical fit? The Steelers, who were a mess at cornerback after Artie Burns' form mysteriously went south. The former first-round pick was toasted early in the season and lost his job after Pittsburgh's Week 7 bye, playing just 12 defensive snaps over the final 10 games of a disappointing campaign. Mike Tomlin's team also has a bit of extra cap space after the $14.5 million it earmarked for Le'Veon Bell last year rolled over to the 2019 cap.
The Vikings also might welcome the opportunity to rehabilitate Burns, who looked to be a promising corner as recently as 2017. Trading Waynes for Burns and a third-round pick could benefit both sides.
5. Add a third wideout to replace Laquon Treadwell. The subject of much frustration from Vikings fans, Treadwell's move into a more regular role last season did not produce fruitful results. The 2016 first-round pick -- drafted before the likes of Sterling Shepard, Michael Thomas and Tyler Boyd -- averaged just 5.7 yards per target, the fourth-worst mark in the NFL among wideouts with 50 targets or more. Boyd is a reminder that wideouts can break out after they've been written off, but the Vikings are likely to decline Treadwell's fifth-year option this offseason, if they don't cut him outright before the 2019 campaign begins.


The Vikings are blessed with a pair of great wideouts in Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen, of course. Both can work out of the slot, although Thielen finds himself on the interior far more frequently. His versatility means the Vikings can be flexible in whom they target as a third wideout, although the price tag obviously can't be exorbitant. The Vikings once went after Alshon Jeffery on a long-term deal before Thielen's breakout, so a bigger wideout such as Dontrelle Inman could make sense.
Let's get to the NFC South, where the Saints repeated as division champs for the first time in franchise history. It would hardly be a surprise to see New Orleans win the division for the third consecutive season in 2019, but if Drew Brees slips, the rest of a frequently entertaining division will be ready to pounce. Let's start with the Falcons, who fired both coordinators in an attempt to get back to the playoffs ...
1. Negotiate a pay cut or a release with Vic Beasley Jr. The microcosm of promise unfulfilled on the Atlanta defense, Beasley led the league with 15.5 sacks in 2016 and has just 10 sacks over two seasons since. The 15.5-sack season was about as unlikely of a campaign as you'll see from a pass-rusher -- he knocked down opposing passers only 16 times in 2016. Beasley was supposed to break out with a full-time move back to the defensive line in 2018, but the former first-round pick generated just five sacks in 16 games.
It's too early to give up on Beasley rounding into form, but his $12.8 million cap hit for 2019 is untenable. In a draft in which there is oodles of defensive line talent, it's difficult to believe that Beasley would get something approaching $13 million per season in free agency, even given that he's two seasons removed from a sack crown. As Beasley turns 27 in July, he's also older than just about every other defender from his 2015 draft class. He's seven months older than Jadeveon Clowney, who was taken with the first pick a year earlier.
There should be a middle ground here that makes sense for both sides. The Falcons could give Beasley a four-year, $62 million extension with $8 million in Year 1 and nothing else fully guaranteed until next March, when the Falcons would either decline their option on the remainder of Beasley's deal or pick up $34 million in guarantees over the subsequent two seasons. If they can't come to terms, the Falcons should trade Beasley for a late-round pick and use the $12.8 million they save elsewhere.
Atlanta already cleared out more than $15 million in room by cutting Robert Alford, Matt Bryant and Brooks Reed, getting the team to just under $29 million in space.
2. Franchise Grady Jarrett. The Falcons will use about half of that available space if they franchise Jarrett, who has rounded into an imposing force in the middle of their defense and arguably become their best pass-rusher. Jarrett finished the season with six sacks and 16 knockdowns, and while he hasn't had that dominant season his tape might indicate, he is still just 25 years old.
The good news for the Falcons is that the defensive tackle franchise tag is consistently less than the figure for defensive ends. CBS' Joel Corry projects a $15.4 million tag for defensive tackles in 2019. A Jarrett extension would come in somewhere around $15 million to $17 million per season.
3. Address the guard spot. After their offensive line went 80-for-80 in starts in 2016 and stayed healthy for the entire regular season, the Falcons haven't been quite as lucky with their line over the ensuing two seasons. Atlanta's would-be starting linemen have missed 28 games over the past two seasons.
The line also hasn't played as well, with the Falcons struggling to replace retired guard Chris Chester. Wes Schweitzer, who won the right guard job as a rookie in 2017, lost it in 2018 before being forced to play left guard once Andy Levitre went down with a torn triceps in Week 2. Levitre is now a free agent. Right tackle Ryan Schraeder hasn't been 100 percent. There just isn't much here after Jake Matthews and Alex Mack, and Atlanta's influential center will turn 34 in November.
Atlanta needs to get better play from its guards in 2019. One obvious fit in free agency might be J.R. Sweezy, given the presence of former Bucs coach Dirk Koetter as offensive coordinator, but the Bucs also had Sweezy take a pay cut after he missed all of his first season in 2016 thanks to injuries and then cut him outright after Year 2. You would understand if Sweezy isn't desperate for another round with Koetter. Rodger Saffold, arguably the top guard on the market, is probably out of Atlanta's price range. The Falcons might have to get creative.
4. Find a new receiving back. When the Falcons signed Devonta Freeman to a five-year, $41.3 million extension, it signaled they were probably going to move on from Tevin Coleman when the lighter half of their running back rotation hit free agency. The Freeman deal, signed after two years in a Kyle Shanahan scheme that has made basically every running back look great for a decade, has been a loser so far. Freeman's efficiency dropped while he fumbled four times in 2017, and he missed 14 games last season.
Coleman was competent in Freeman's absence, but he's going to get a multiyear deal on the market. The Falcons will want to draft a receiving back to replace Coleman.
5. Extend Julio Jones. The Falcons don't typically extend their players before the final year of their deals -- Atlanta didn't even hand Matt Ryan a new deal after he won MVP with two years left to go on his deal in 2016 -- but they could make an exception for their star wideout. Jones made his desires known last summer by deleting all of the Falcons content from his Instagram account, and the Falcons subsequently turned some of his 2018 and 2019 base salary into a bonus to get Jones a quick boost.
Nobody would argue against the idea that Jones is underpaid, given that he has two years and just over $21 million left on his extension in a market in which Sammy Watkins just signed a three-year, $48 million deal. Jones is closer to Marqise Lee-type money, and while I don't want to be disrespectful to the Lee family, I think even they would admit that Jones is a different caliber of receiver.
It will be tricky because the other recent major contracts for wideouts were signed with one year left to go on their respective deals. Mike Evans got $41.8 million in new money over the first three seasons of his extension. Antonio Brown picked up $42.2 million in the same category, and Odell Beckham Jr. was at $44.3 million. Evans has the most total money due over the first three seasons of his deal at $55 million, but he also was already in line to make $13.3 million and the third year of his extension is unguaranteed.
Because Jones has two years left on his current deal, the calculus changes. The Falcons also front-loaded Jones' last extension to pay him more money up front, and after he wanted to hold out on the back end of the deal, they probably won't want to do that again as part of his current extension. This is going to be a complicated negotiation.

Jones will look to top Beckham's contract numbers, which means something in the ballpark of a five-year, $95 million extension. The goal for Julio and his representation would probably be to take home something around $60 million over the first three years of the deal.
1. Address the tackle position. The Panthers have some work to do. The good news is that second-year tackle Taylor Moton had a very good season on the right side and appears to be locked into that role for the years to come. No worries there. Moton took over for Daryl Williams, who missed virtually all of 2018 with knee injuries. More on him in a second.
The left side of the line isn't quite as enticing. One of Dave Gettleman's last moves as Panthers general manager was to sign Matt Kalil to an inexplicable five-year, $55.5 million deal before the 2017 season. The oft-injured Kalil had a subpar 2017 season before missing the entire 2018 campaign with a knee injury. Chris Clark, who became the starter in Kalil's absence, was a stopgap and is now a free agent.
The Panthers find themselves in a difficult place with Kalil, who has a $12.5 million cap hit in 2019. If they cut him, they'll owe $14.7 million in dead money. Even if they designate Kalil as a post-June 1 release, they would owe $4.9 million in 2019 before a $9.8 million charge in 2020. No team wants to eat that much dead money, but Kalil might not justify the roster spot if the Panthers can find a competent left tackle.
This brings us back to Williams, who was a second-team All-Pro right tackle in 2017 and is now a free agent. The Panthers briefly slotted Moton in as their starting left tackle in place of Kalil before moving him to the right side once Williams reinjured his knee. One option for the Panthers would be to cut Kalil, re-sign Williams, then move Moton to left tackle. It's high-risk -- Moton might not be able to play left tackle -- but they might also end up with the best possible combination of tackles available from this three-man bunch.
More likely, the Panthers will let Williams leave, keep Moton on the right side and give Kalil one more year at left tackle. Taking a tackle in the first few rounds of the 2019 draft should be in the cards for Carolina.
2. Find a free safety. The Panthers re-signed Eric Reid after he impressed as a midseason signing, but they probably need to find him a partner in center field. Mike Adams, who was the starter a year ago, is probably best suited for a reserve player/coach role at this point. Carolina has 2018 third-rounder Rashaan Gaulden in the mix, but he's still converting to the position after playing mostly corner in college and likely profiles as a strong safety, where Reid is best.
The good news for the Panthers is that the veteran market is deep at free safety, given the presence of Earl Thomas, Tyrann Mathieu and several others. Ha Ha Clinton-Dix could make sense here given his likely price tag.
3. Add an edge rusher. The Panthers finished 25th in sack rate last season, with a surprisingly mediocre season from Kawann Short; the edge rushers behind Mario Addison didn't do very much to move the needle, either. Addison finished with 10 sacks, but Julius Peppers was the only other defender with more than 3.5 takedowns, and the future Hall of Famer just announced his retirement. Wes Horton, who started eight games a year ago, is also a free agent.
Again, the Panthers find themselves in the right moment for adding defensive line help, given that this is a draft that is absolutely loaded with front-seven defenders. GM Marty Hurney should be able to grab an impactful pass-rusher for coach Ron Rivera with the 16th overall pick. The Panthers also could dip into the free-agent market for help, where a veteran such as Benson Mayowa or Bruce Irvin could contribute in a rotational role.
4. Decline the fifth-year option on Vernon Butler. The Louisiana Tech product simply hasn't improved since entering the NFL, and in a Panthers organization that has done a good job of developing defensive linemen, the onus for that would seem to fall on Butler. The 24-year-old was a healthy scratch in December. It wouldn't be a shock if he were on another roster come Week 1. A reunion with Gettleman in New York is entirely plausible.

5. Draft a replacement for Ryan Kalil. Carolina's longtime center (and Matt's brother) retired this offseason, leaving the Panthers with a hole at the pivot. There are centers such as Mitch Morse and Matt Paradis on the free-agent market, but the Panthers might prefer to lean toward the draft for cap reasons. Carolina already met with NC State product Garrett Bradbury at the Senior Bowl, and adding at least one rookie to compete with Tyler Larsen for the starting job would make sense.
1. Create some cap space. The Saints can free up $7.7 million in room by releasing Kurt Coleman and Cameron Meredith. Meredith played just 126 snaps on offense before aggravating his knee injury, and Coleman's $7 million cap hit is onerous for a veteran who played only 34.9 percent of the regular-season snaps. The former Panthers standout played just three defensive snaps during the postseason. Those moves should get the Saints to about $17 million in total cap space.
2. Let Mark Ingram leave if the price gets too high. It's going to be difficult to let the popular Ingram leave town in free agency, but the Saints might not have the cap space to keep him if he gets starting-caliber money elsewhere. Ingram still plays a meaningful role in this offense -- he averaged 13.8 touches per game after returning from his PED suspension in Week 5, compared to Alvin Kamara's 16.7 (not including the meaningless Week 17 contest) -- but the Saints are going to be pinching pennies to fill out the bottom 20 percent of their roster.
They need to go into the offseason with a hard number on Ingram and stick to it. If it's $4 million or less, New Orleans could justify keeping Ingram around for a couple of seasons more. Anything more and it is probably better off adding a back in the draft.
3. Re-sign Andrus Peat. Although the Saints drafted Peat as a tackle, he has settled in as a very good guard, albeit with an injury history. With Peat's fifth-year option arriving, the Saints should be ready to give the Stanford product an extension. They can even structure the deal to lower Peat's $9.6 million cap hit, although the deal is not going to come cheap.
Peat's deal probably will come in somewhere around five years and $65 million. This will be a tough negotiation: If the Saints aren't willing to pay up, Peat will attract big money in free agency from teams that want to sign him to play tackle in 2020.
4. Maintain the other side of the ball. Picking up Sheldon Rankins' fifth-year option, meanwhile, is a no-brainer on defense. Rankins tore his Achilles in the divisional-round win over the Eagles, but the option would be too conservative to decline as it doesn't come into play until the 2020 season.
The Saints also need to add at least one pass-rusher to their rotation with Alex Okafor hitting free agency; they could re-sign Okafor or go after one of the edge-rushers who are likely to be released by their teams this offseason to avoid affecting the compensatory formula. If the Saints could persuade somebody like Terrell Suggs or Cameron Wake to wait until the July 1 deadline before signing, that also would be a way to add another piece to the puzzle.
5. Trade up for Kyler Murray (within reason). The gambit to trade for Teddy Bridgewater ended up being rather inconsequential, as his only start in a Saints uniform came in Week 17. The Saints lost a third-round pick as part of the deal, but if they don't cancel out losing Bridgewater with a similar signing in unrestricted free agency, they should be able to recoup a 2020 compensatory pick, most likely in the fourth round.
NFL Nation reporters grade each eliminated team's 2018 regular season and look ahead to what's in store this offseason. Full coverage ¬ª
I love the idea of the Saints ending up with Murray in the draft. Sean Payton was reportedly fond of Baker Mayfield last year, and while Mayfield's successor at Oklahoma is hardly identical, it's easy to imagine how Murray's accuracy, delivery and playmaking ability would make him a very viable weapon in Payton's offense. Murray would likely need a redshirt year a la Patrick Mahomes in Kansas City, which is in line with Brees' time frame, given that the 40-year-old's contract voids after 2019.
My suspicion is that Murray will drop during the pre-draft process, although that has nothing to do with him and more with the archaic rules teams place on quarterbacks. When Murray measures in below 6-foot at the combine, a handful of teams will take him off their boards or give him impossibly low grades on height alone. If he measures below 5-10, that list will get longer. That would be great news for the Saints.
The tricky part is that New Orleans doesn't have a first-round pick after trading up for Marcus Davenport last year, so it is going to need to leverage its 2020 first-rounder to try to move up. If the Saints package their second-round pick and that 2020 first-rounder, that should be enough to move into the bottom half of the first round. The Seahawks (21) and the Ravens (22) are teams comfortable with trading down for future selections, and they pick just ahead of the Raiders at 24 and 27. That could be a viable landing spot for Murray and the Saints.

If I'm wrong and the league correctly values Murray's on-field ability, he'll go in the top 10, and the Saints probably won't be able to move up to grab him. In that case, the Saints will need to go back into the market for a Brees backup. If Sam Bradford is able to pass a physical, he would be a logical fit in that role.
1. Cut DeSean Jackson and Beau Allen. The Bucs already cut Vinny Curry, and Allen might follow him out the door, thanks to a $5 million cap hit in a year where the draft is full of defensive linemen. The Bucs allowed 4.9 yards per carry and first downs on 31.8 percent of run attempts with Allen on the field, numbers that fell to 4.5 yards per rush and 25.8 percent, respectively, with Allen sidelined. Jackson's release seems to be little more than a formality.
2. Ask Gerald McCoy to take a pay cut. The Bucs have publicly floated the idea of releasing their star defensive tackle, which seems like a curious move given that they ranked 32nd in defensive DVOA last season. McCoy does turn 31 this month and has a $13 million cap hit, the fourth largest on the roster.
The argument for releasing McCoy is that the Bucs are going to move to a 3-4 base defense under Todd Bowles, and McCoy profiles best as a penetrating 3-technique tackle in a 4-3 defense, as he has played throughout his career. The sheer number of defensive linemen available in the draft also makes expensive veterans less valuable, and it's plausible that McCoy would struggle to find $13 million per season on the open market.
I don't think the Bucs should release McCoy. For one, the 4-3/3-4 distinction doesn't mean much in 2019. Bowles has already said the Bucs will be a one-gap defense, meaning McCoy will have chances to attack. In Bowles' final season with the Jets, they were in their base defense only 19.8 percent of the time, with the rest of their snaps either coming in goal-line situations or with five or more defensive backs on the field. The Jets were in a 4-3 for two-thirds of those base defense snaps, even after years with Bowles in charge. Bowles' scheme is less about 3-4 or 4-3 and more about finding creative ways to blitz out of nickel and dime packages.
The Bucs don't really have the personnel to play in a 3-4, either. Their middle linebacker in 2018 was Kwon Alexander, who got hurt and is now a free agent. Lavonte David will have to move to one of the two inside linebacker spots, and although the roles should be similar, he'll have to go through an adjustment period. Jason Pierre-Paul, who has spent his entire career as a 4-3 defensive end, isn't going to turn into a cover linebacker at 30. The best fit for the Bucs is to stick in the 4-3 when they go with their base set.
What would make sense for the Bucs would be to restructure McCoy's deal as part of an extension. They could offer McCoy a four-year contract in the $50 million range with guarantees in 2019 and 2020 that simultaneously bring down his cap number for 2019. McCoy might not want to hit the open market, and the Bucs aren't in a position to be getting rid of talented defensive players.
3. Franchise Donovan Smith. Is Smith a franchise left tackle? No, probably not. The consistency hasn't yet been there for the Penn State product, on a per-game or a per-season basis. Stats LLC credits him with zero sacks allowed in 2016, but that was in a season in which he took 13 penalties. Smith has allowed either five or 5.5 sacks in each of his three other campaigns, but he also has stayed healthy and brought his penalty totals down from that 13-penalty mark to six last season.
The Bucs just hired a coach in Bruce Arians who loves to chuck the ball deep downfield. They need pass-blockers who can hold up under that strain, and if the Bucs lose Smith, the only other left tackle option on the market is Trent Brown, who is likely looking at franchise-caliber money. Tampa also has undrafted free agents backing up Smith and Demar Dotson on the outside. I'd lock up Smith and work toward a long-term deal.
4. Import the ex-Cardinals. You know Arians and Bowles are going to go back to the well and try to bring in some of the players who excelled under their stewardship in Arizona. The two obvious fits might be relative bargains. John Brown looked healthy for the first time in years during the first half of the season in Baltimore, but he never developed any chemistry with Lamar Jackson. Brown caught just eight passes on 30 targets for 114 yards over Jackson's seven starts. He could be the replacement for DeSean Jackson in Tampa.
The other fit would be Deone Bucannon, who went from looking like the prototype for the new hybrid linebacker during his time with Bowles to totally getting lost in the shuffle last season under Steve Wilks. Bucannon needs to end up in a place where the defensive coordinator will play to his strengths instead of emphasizing his weaknesses. Going back to what worked with Bowles would make sense for both parties, especially if the Bucs don't re-sign Alexander.
5. Bring back Patrick Murray. Now that the ""Browns quarterback jersey"" is being retired with the rise of Baker Mayfield, the next sadness jersey probably should be dedicated to Buccaneers kickers. Here are the kickers they have gone through in the Jason Licht era:


Murray is 39-of-47 (82.9 percent) on field goals. The rest of this bunch -- a group that includes two kickers given significant guaranteed money and one whom Licht traded up to draft in the second round -- is 77-of-109 (70.6 percent). At some point, Licht just shouldn't be allowed to evaluate kickers, right?
Let's start with the team holding the first overall pick in April's draft:
1. Address the offensive line (again). It seems every move the Cardinals have made to try to fix their offensive line issues over the past several seasons has been a bust, mostly thanks to injury. Free agents such as Mike Iupati and Justin Pugh haven't stayed healthy. D.J. Humphries, a first-round pick in 2015, spent his first season in Bruce Arians' doghouse before struggling with injuries; he has played just 27 of 64 possible games over four seasons. By the end of 2018, rookie quarterback Josh Rosen was playing behind a line of five backups. Imagine if your first student driving lesson involved merging onto the track at Talladega.

More NFL coverage ¬ª
Re-signing Joe Barksdale, who arrived as a midseason waiver claim from the Chargers, is a reasonable place to start. The Cards won't re-sign Iupati after a disappointing stint in Arizona, and given new coach Kliff Kingsbury's predilection for throwing the football, they'll want someone who is a better pass-blocker on the interior.
Humphries is a difficult case, as the Florida product is entering his fifth-year option and coming off a season-ending knee injury that might prevent him from passing a physical. If Humphries can't pass the physical, Arizona will be on the hook for his $9.6 million option. If Humphries can pass, the team can choose to cut him, but it has no obvious replacement for Humphries at left tackle.
Then again, according to Stats LLC, Humphries has allowed 12 sacks in 27 starts, including five in nine games last season. The Cardinals might as well keep him around and see if there's anything there in a rebuilding year, but they need to have a Plan B they're comfortable with if Humphries doesn't suddenly find his form.
2. Resolve Patrick Peterson's future. While Peterson retracted the trade request he made around the October deadline, the Cardinals are in a bit of a quandary when it comes to their superstar cornerback. He has two years and just under $24 million left on the five-year, $70 million extension he signed in the summer of 2014, which is relatively cheap for a franchise cornerback.
Peterson's next deal is likely going to reset the cornerback market, which is topped by the five-year, $75 million deal Josh Norman signed with Washington in 2016. Peterson turns 29 in July, so if Arizona waits until next offseason, it will be mostly paying for years on the wrong side of 30, and those seasons might very well be coming for a rebuilding franchise.
The best time to do something about Peterson's future is now. If the Cardinals don't think they want to pay Peterson top-tier money for his age-31 and age-32 seasons, this is when he'll have the most trade value. If they want to sign Peterson to an extension, now's the time. Assuming that the first three years of Peterson's new deal will be fully or practically guaranteed, it's better to use the two years of below-market money they have as leverage to lock up Peterson from ages 29 to 31 as opposed to ages 30 to 32. A five-year, $80 million extension with $40 million guaranteed at signing would be a good place to start.
3. Find more cornerback help. Arizona hasn't been able to solve its cornerback spot across from Peterson for several years now, with everyone from Justin Bethel to Marcus Cooper to Tramon Williams filling in for short stints. By the end of the year, Raiders castoff David Amerson was starting.
One signing or trade can dictate several more moves. Let's lay out destinations for seven potential free agents, then predict what comes next.
Le'Veon Bell's landing spot, blockbuster trades, draft moves -- we have fearless predictions that would shake up the NFL.
So long, 2018 season. It's never too early to look ahead to 2019. Our crew of insiders weighs in on the biggest topics of the offseason.
Arizona tried to beat the market to the punch by signing former Falcons corner Robert Alford to a three-year, $22.5 million deal last week. Counting on Alford when he was one of the worst starting corners in the league in 2018 is a dangerous proposition. At the least, they should be looking for a corner in the second- to third-round range to develop behind the 30-year-old Alford. It would be easier to find that corner if the Cards ...
4. Trade the No. 1 overall pick for multiple selections. They won't be taking a quarterback with Rosen already on the roster. It will be tempting to keep the top pick in this draft and use it on a defensive difference-maker such as Ohio State's Nick Bosa or Alabama's Quinnen Williams, both of whom profile as absolute studs and wonderful complements to Chandler Jones.
In a draft this deep with defensive talent -- Mel Kiper Jr.'s first mock draft has 16 front-seven pieces going in the first round -- the value in using the first overall pick on a defensive player just is not there. There are no sure things in any draft, and the Cardinals can find a pass-rusher who isn't likely to be far off from Bosa later in the first round.
More importantly, though, the Cardinals simply need to stockpile talent after years of poor drafts. There's nobody left on the roster from the 2012 draft that preceded Steve Keim's promotion to general manager. Once free agency begins, no player from Keim's 2013 or 2014 drafts will be left in the organization. The 2015 draft will be down to Humphries and David Johnson. The 2016 draft is down to Robert Nkemdiche and Brandon Williams, both of whom have been wildly disappointing.
Keim's 2017 draft was more promising, and it's still way too early to judge the 2018 class, but the Cardinals have one above-average starter and three athletes who haven't been healthy or effective to show for five years of drafts. They need to amass draft picks and rebuild their roster. They need to hope that somebody falls in love with a quarterback and doesn't want to run any risk of another team trading up with the 49ers at No. 2. If Arizona can get an extra first-rounder or a pair of second-rounders to move down, it needs to seriously consider that offer.
5. Add another wide receiver capable of playing on the outside. Arizona's two best wideouts are Larry Fitzgerald and Christian Kirk. They're both best suited to play in the slot at this point in their careers, and there's not much doing for the Cardinals on the outside. Fitz spent more time in 2018 in the slot, where he caught 47 of his 69 receptions.

If this is the 35-year-old Fitzgerald's final season, the Cardinals will likely prepare for 2020 with Kirk in the slot and question marks on the outside. Chad Williams, a third-round pick in 2017, caught just 37 percent of the passes thrown to him a year ago and hasn't shown much in the NFL. Bringing in a receiver who can win at the line of scrimmage, either in free agency or via the draft, should be a priority in aiding Rosen's development.
1. Convince Andrew Whitworth to come back. The easiest way for the Rams to disappoint in 2019 is for their offensive line to take a step backward. We saw how Sean McVay's offense ground to a halt amid a poor performance from its line in Super Bowl LIII, and with no experienced replacement for Whitworth on the roster (and just one top-95 pick in the draft), the Rams desperately need their 37-year-old left tackle to put off retirement and return for another season.
What will it take to convince Whitworth to stay? As he enters the final year of his three-year contract, the Rams could give Whitworth a one-year extension with a raise in 2019 to start. Is he sick of the Los Angeles traffic? Owner Stan Kroenke has to have a spare helicopter laying around somewhere. Let Whitworth commute on the chopper. Get him a black card for Yoshinoya. Whatever it takes.
2. Bring back Rodger Saffold and C.J. Anderson. Might as well keep the left side of the line intact, and at 30, Saffold should still have several years left in the tank. There might still be a team out there that looks at him as a possible tackle candidate, but Saffold is probably looking at a deal in the $11-12 million annual salary range.
Anderson and Los Angeles seems like a good fit for all parties involved after the former Broncos back came off the street and excelled in December and January. The Rams shouldn't go over $3 million per season to retain him, but as an insurance policy against Todd Gurley II's knee -- which, he'll be happy to tell you, is fine and definitely not injured -- Anderson is a helpful backup.
3. Trade down from the 31st pick. Teams will buzz the Rams on the end of Day 1 in the hopes of trading back into the first round, which has the advantage of providing teams with a fifth-year option. The Rams will want to make the pick, of course, but this is a team that has traded away most of its top picks to either draft Jared Goff or build around him.
It's more important that L.A. comes away with two or three solid contributors from this draft who can succeed for cheap over the next few seasons than go after one player with a slightly stronger chance of becoming a star, especially as the team continues to lock in the core of this squad. If the Rams can get a team picking in the top half of the round to send them second-round picks in 2019 and 2020, they should jump at the chance.

4. Sign Clay Matthews and wait out the market on veterans. Matthews is almost too obvious of a fit. The Rams are thin on the edge and probably won't be able to afford to bring back Dante Fowler Jr. Matthews grew up in Southern California and walked on at USC, playing for the Trojans in the same stadium that is now the Rams' home. Matthews' numbers are down in recent years, but joining the Rams would allow him to play as a full-time edge rusher. The inside linebacker work Matthews did in Green Bay also should depress his price to the point where the Rams can afford to bring in Matthews on a one-year deal.
Every veteran player who wants a meaningful shot at winning a Super Bowl is going to tell his agent he wants to play for the Rams this offseason. The Rams will likely sit out most of free agency to avoid impacting their standing in the compensatory pick formula, but they'll target players who are cut by their current teams, since those players won't count against the compensatory formula.
Who could fit into that plan? At wide receiver, the Rams could stash a wideout like Emmanuel Sanders on the physically unable to perform list to have depth in case of, say, another Cooper Kupp injury. If the Vikings cut Everson Griffen, another former USC product, the Rams would loom as an obvious destination. Justin Houston also would make sense. There will be surprise cuts, as there are every year, and the Rams will presumably have first dibs on any of those. They should have enough clout to encourage some veterans to hold off on signing until after July 1, when the moves won't touch the compensatory formula.
5. Don't extend Jared Goff this offseason. Teams have the option of extending their first-round picks with long-term deals after the end of their third seasons in the league. In most cases, they wait a year and reap the benefits of a fourth season priced in at well below market value. The exceptions are generally for transcendent superstars such as J.J. Watt and Patrick Peterson.
The Rams are the exception to the exception: They've done several fourth-year extensions under GM Les Snead, including deals for Tavon Austin, Robert Quinn and, most recently, Gurley. You can see how those moves went. Austin was a disastrous contract from the jump. Quinn fell off dramatically after posting 19 sacks in Year 3, although he looked like an absolute star. Gurley was an MVP candidate for half of 2018, but he was struggling by the end of the season with a mysterious knee injury, and the Rams didn't skip a beat when they replaced Gurley with Anderson.
It's too early to evaluate the Gurley deal, but as we get to Goff's future, look no further than the Super Bowl. The Patriots flummoxed Goff in a way that might end up being telling. He made a few excellent anticipatory throws, but he spent most of the game out of rhythm waiting for somebody to get open.
Earlier this year, I brought up the idea of a team constantly remaining on the rookie quarterback cycle by drafting a quarterback, developing him into a star, and then trading him at the end of his rookie deal for a high draft pick to repeat the process. The right team would have a brilliant offensive mind for a head coach and oodles of offensive talent, players the team otherwise would have to let go to pay their quarterback a premium.

‚Ä¢  Watch: Manning on Jared Goff ¬ª

The Rams are the most obvious example for this concept, although it's clear they believe Goff is a bona fide franchise quarterback. I don't think the Rams will hop back on the rookie passer cycle. I don't think they should trade Goff at the end of his rookie deal, either. I don't know whether any team will ever have the guts to do it, because getting that rookie quarterback evaluation wrong as a GM means you're getting fired and becoming the butt of jokes for a decade. It's too much pressure.
At the same time, I don't think Goff is such an obvious perennial Offensive Player of the Year candidate that the Rams need to start extending him immediately. It has to at least be a little concerning that Goff's numbers fell off once Kupp was injured, especially because Kupp is the exact sort of luxury the Rams would struggle to keep around at the going rate for wide receivers once they give Goff a raise.

There's no rush here. Get another year of information, and if Goff is the player the Rams think he is, they'll still have tons of leverage to extend him after Year 4. The Rams can use their cap space now to add veteran talent or roll it over to have extra money when Goff does get expensive. And if Goff does take a step backward in 2019, well, it could save the Rams from a Derek Carr-esque conundrum.
1. Move on from Pierre Garcon, Garry Gilliam and Malcolm Smith. It's almost a lock that the 49ers will part ways with the 32-year-old Garcon, who has struggled with injuries during his two years in San Francisco while being passed on the depth chart. Gilliam, who served as the backup tackle behind Joe Staley and Mike McGlinchey, played just 8 percent of San Francisco's offense snaps last season and has a cap charge north of $5 million in 2019. Smith, a bizarrely expensive signing in 2017, missed all of that season with a torn pectoral muscle and then started only five games in 2018.
Those three moves will clear out about $7.3 million in cap space and get the 49ers to just over $70 million in room.
2. Franchise Robbie Gould. The 49ers can work out a long-term deal with their 36-year-old kicker, of course, but with no other realistic options for the franchise tag, GM John Lynch can keep Gould around for 2019. Gould was the seventh-best kicker in football on scoring plays last year.
3. Pursue a cornerback in free agency. Although Richard Sherman was a success in his first season by the Bay and K'Waun Williams has rounded into a solid slot cornerback, the other corner spot has been an issue. Ahkello Witherspoon regressed in his second season before tearing his PCL, and while 2018 third-rounder Tarvarius Moore came up with the occasional big play in Witherspoon's absence, he also looked like a rookie for stretches, too.
In a division with the Rams, three good cornerbacks are the minimum. Sherman also has already suggested that a move to free safety could eventually be in the cards, although it doesn't appear that such a move would be likely to occur in 2019. Either way, the 49ers should be in the market for a cornerback this offseason.
Unfortunately for the Niners, this cornerback market isn't exactly filled with sure things. Assuming the 49ers want somebody with size for coordinator Robert Saleh's scheme, the two most obvious fits would be Colts corner Pierre Desir and Patriots regular Eric Rowe, each of whom are 6-foot-1. Desir is coming off a career year in Indy, while Rowe has a longer track record but hasn't been able to stay healthy. The former Eagles draftee has missed 27 games over the past three seasons. Good money on a team-friendly structure might be the way to go here.
There are much more obvious fits at free safety, where the market is far deeper. The most tantalizing move would be to reunite the Legion of Boom by signing away Earl Thomas from the Seahawks, although the future Hall of Famer hasn't played a full 16-game season since 2015 and turns 30 in May. Thomas would be a plug-and-play free safety, with Jaquiski Tartt stepping in as the 49ers' version of Kam Chancellor. Lamarcus Joyner, Tyrann Mathieu and Ha Ha Clinton-Dix are also free agents the 49ers could pursue at the position.
4. Find a Leo. Although the 49ers have spent three first-round picks on defensive linemen over the past four seasons, they've managed to unearth only one excellent pass-rusher in defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, who posted 12 sacks and 20 knockdowns in a breakout 2018 campaign. Cassius Marsh chipped in with 5.5 sacks, but everything up to this point has suggested that Marsh is a better fit as a rotation end.

The Seahawks-style defense Saleh runs in San Francisco is designed to work with an athletic weakside pass-rusher whose sole job is to ruin quarterbacks' days. The 49ers haven't really had a Leo since Saleh came on board, with players such as Elvis Dumervil and Eli Harold filling the role out of necessity's sake. Former first-round picks Arik Armstead and Solomon Thomas aren't good fits in the Leo role. The 49ers need someone quicker and with more bend to get after the quarterback.
A great fit would be Nick Bosa, but he's the favorite to come off the board with the first overall pick to the Cardinals, just ahead of San Francisco at No. 2. If Arizona trades out of the pick to a team that wants to draft a quarterback, well, the 49ers should be all set to draft Bosa. If not, the popular pick for the 49ers has been Kentucky edge rusher Josh Allen, but the Niners might also be able to trade down and grab an extra selection while still taking a pass-rusher somewhere in the 8-12 range.
5. Hold on to Nick Mullens. As far as practice-squad passers go, teams have done a lot worse than the 49ers did with Mullens at quarterback in 2018. He isn't going to win the job from Jimmy Garoppolo anytime soon, but Mullens posted a 90.8 passer rating and averaged 8.3 yards per attempt with a set of skill-position weapons beset by injuries. The 49ers also have Mullens under contract for two more seasons at less than $1 million per year, given that the Southern Mississippi product will be an exclusive rights free agent in 2020.
At the least, he appears to be a competent backup quarterback, a role that teams usually pay something in the $6 million per year range to fill. Mullens has $10 million in surplus value on his current deal, let alone the implied value of what would happen if he continues to develop and turns into a viable starting quarterback. In a financial system in which cheap quarterbacks rule the world, Mullens has significant trade value.
In some cases, I would encourage a team like the 49ers to trust their coaching staff and scouts to find and develop another undrafted free agent such as Mullens. I can't do that here. When I wrote about Garoppolo before the 2018 season, I mentioned that we couldn't be confident he would be healthy for a full season.

Garoppolo has now suffered two serious injuries in his three short stints as a starter, as the 27-year-old separated his shoulder in his second start with the Patriots in 2016 before tearing his ACL three games into the 2018 campaign. The 49ers have the talent to compete for a playoff spot if their team can stay healthy in 2019, and their highest upside is with a healthy Garoppolo, but I'm not convinced he'll be able to stay healthy for 16 games at a time. Mullens is too valuable of an insurance policy to trade away.
1. Put a full-page ad in the newspaper thanking Earl Thomas for his contributions. I would've preferred to write ""Franchise Earl Thomas"" or ""Pay Earl Thomas a lot of money,"" but I think those ships sailed when the legendary Seahawks safety flipped off his own sideline as he was being carted off last season. It's clear the Seahawks don't want to offer Thomas a long-term contact, and the franchise tag wouldn't make either party happy.
What the Seahawks can do, though, is try to repair the relationship for the future. Put an ad in The Seattle Times thanking Thomas for his incredible run with the team. Soft-retire his No. 29 and don't give it to anyone else until Thomas retires. For whatever has happened over the past year, Thomas is one of the best players to ever wear a Seahawks uniform. Ten years from now, the stuff he did on the field is going to be his legacy. From here on out, it's about attempting to create a scenario in which both sides can feel good about celebrating that one day.
2. Franchise Frank Clark. While the Seahawks will likely look to retain several of their pending free agents -- notably D.J. Fluker, J.R. Sweezy and Justin Coleman -- Clark is the one free agent the Seahawks absolutely have to retain. In a class of edge rushers who are likely to stay on their current teams via the franchise tag, Clark will be in the mix alongside Jadeveon Clowney and DeMarcus Lawrence for extensions. Lawrence will make more because he's on his second franchise tag, but if any of these guys signs an extension, it will be with an annual salary between $18 million and $20 million per year.
3. Extend Russell Wilson. The Seahawks went with a run-heavy approach in 2018 that minimized Wilson's impact on the offense -- he threw just 427 passes in 16 games after averaging 527 over the prior three seasons -- but Wilson made up for it with hyper-efficiency. He's not showing any signs of slippage at 30, and while Wilson would find it extremely difficult to toss touchdown passes on 8.2 percent of his dropbacks again in 2019, he remains one of the league's truly elite quarterbacks when not forced to run for his life before even receiving the snap.
The Seahawks have tended to favor four-year extensions under GM John Schneider, so it's likely that Seattle will hand Wilson a large signing bonus and lock him up until his age-34 campaign. With Aaron Rodgers averaging $33.5 million in annual salary and $103 million over the first three years of his extension with the Packers, the obvious number to look for here is $35 million per season. A four-year, $140 million extension is eventually where this should settle.
4. Extend Bobby Wagner too. The Seahawks probably will let K.J. Wright hit free agency this offseason, but it's difficult to imagine them letting Wagner leave next offseason. Negotiations won't be quite as cut and dried as they are with Wilson because of positional scarcity, but Wagner is still rightly regarded as arguably the best player at his position in football.

The gold standard deal for a linebacker who doesn't rush the passer is Jamie Collins' four-year, $50 million deal from January 2017. I think the Seahawks probably will have to top that as part of a Wagner extension, given that the five-time Pro Bowler is already making north of $10 million per season on his current extension. Going to $15 million per season is too ambitious, but Wagner's new four-year extension should come in between $52 million and $56 million.
5. Sign Muhammad Wilkerson. The extensions probably will limit much of what the Seahawks can do in free agency, and unless they want to sign a free safety to replace Thomas, there aren't many great matches between where the Seahawks would want to spend money and useful players.
One logical place to target would be defensive tackle, where the Seahawks have been struggling with their decisions for years. Malik McDowell, the team's second-round pick in 2017, never played a snap for the team after reportedly suffering serious injuries in an ATV accident. The injury led the Seahawks to trade a second-round pick and Jermaine Kearse for Sheldon Richardson, who left for the Vikings on a one-year deal in free agency. Shamar Stephen left something to be desired next to Jarran Reed, and while Poona Ford has flashed in brief moments, the Seahawks should add at least one veteran to their rotation.
Wilkerson, who looked good for the Packers last season before going down with a serious ankle injury, is probably going to settle for a one-year deal in the hopes of rebuilding his value. He would make sense as the latest Seahawks transplant on the interior.
"
25913964,"As Russell Wilson heads into the final year of his deal, the Pro Bowl quarterback and the Seattle Seahawks have not engaged in a single contract discussion since the day they announced their last deal in 2015, league sources told ESPN.
Neither Wilson nor the Seahawks have mentioned to each other whether they are hoping to extend his deal or what a potential new contract would look like, according to sources.
But if Wilson and the Seahawks do finally discuss a deal, and eventually agree on one, it would be expected to be the biggest in the NFL this offseason, likely topping the $33.5 million annual average that the Green Bay Packers awarded quarterback Aaron Rodgers before the 2018 season kicked off.
Here's what you need to know about the most significant storyline of the Seahawks' 2019 offseason: a Russell Wilson contract extension.
But Wilson's deal, like others ahead, could be complicated because of the potential work stoppage that awaits the NFL in 2021.
The last time Wilson and the Seahawks reached agreement on a contract came on July 31, 2015 -- the day Seattle opened training camp.
The sides could be hoping to be on a similar timeline this season -- and Wilson has other business to tend to in the interim. He has spoken to the New York Yankees and plans to participate in their spring training, according to a source.
Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said during his season-ending news conference that he and Wilson spoke about the quarterback's future and that an extension this offseason is ""very much in our plans.""
Said Wilson, one day after the Seahawks were eliminated by the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC wild-card round: ""To be the franchise quarterback of the Seattle Seahawks is a special thing, so we'll see where that goes. I don't like talking about my contract or anything like that, but I think good things will happen.""
Wilson quickly answered in the affirmative when asked whether he'd be willing to play out the final year of his current contract, which would put him in position to go year-to-year on the franchise tag. He's set to make $17 million in 2019.
""Oh yeah, if that's what I've got to do,"" he said. ""It's business and everything. I know essentially after the season, I could potentially be a free agent, that kind of thing. I don't think that way. I see myself being in Seattle. I love Seattle, and it's a special place for me.""

25908816,"From the opening of the regular season, when he threw 10 touchdown passes in the first two games, to the end, when he finished as the second player in NFL history to throw 50 touchdown passes and for more than 5,000 yards, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes seemed destined to win major awards.
That became a reality Saturday night when Mahomes was named The Associated Press 2018 NFL Most Valuable Player. He received 41 votes from a nationwide panel of media members who regularly cover the league, easily beating out Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who earned nine votes.
""I'm so humbled,"" Mahomes said. ""This is just the beginning. We've got a long ways to go.""
Mahomes appeared to be the leader in the MVP race from the start of the season to the finish. In his first season as a starter, one year after the Chiefs traded up to draft him in the first round, he led them to a 12-4 record, a third consecutive AFC West championship and to the AFC Championship Game for the first time in 25 years.
Patrick Mahomes is the fourth youngest MVP, as well as the fourth different player to win the award before his 24th birthday:
Mahomes was more than eye-popping stats, though.
He made an assortment of spectacular plays, from reversing his field twice to throw a touchdown pass against the San Francisco 49ers, to no-look passes. He delivered in the clutch, from a left-handed pass that allowed the Chiefs to continue what would be a game-winning fourth-quarter touchdown drive against the Denver Broncos, to a fourth-down pass across his body that allowed the Chiefs to continue what would be a tying touchdown in the fourth quarter against the Baltimore Ravens.
""The play is never dead. He can find new ways to get you the ball,'' Chiefs All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce said. ""It may look like a screwball, a slider here or there, but it'll get to you eventually.""
Mahomes' breakout season also earned him the NFL Offensive Player of the Year award Saturday.
Defensive Player of the Year 
For the second consecutive season, Aaron Donald is the Defensive Player of the Year.
Patrick Mahomes achieved the rare 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns feat this season, but it may not be the only time he does so.
No. 2 overall draft pick Saquon Barkley, who rushed for 1,307 yards and 11 TDs for the Giants this season, was named the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year at the NFL Honors show.
Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Chris Long was named the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year on Saturday for his activities off the field.
In a two-man race that wasn't much of a contest, the defensive tackle who will lead the Rams into Sunday's Super Bowl against New England earned 45 votes. The only unanimous member of the 2018 All-Pro team, Donald easily outdistanced Chicago edge rusher Khalil Mack, also an All-Pro, who received five votes.
Donald, the only Rams player selected for the top defensive honor, joins Lawrence Taylor and J.J. Watt as players to win the award in back-to-back seasons. Donald led the NFL with 20.5 sacks.
""Any time you put a body of work into it and then it pays off,'' Donald said, ""and you're rewarded for it, it means a lot. It's a blessing.''
Comeback Player of the Year
Andrew Luck is the NFL Comeback Player of the Year in a landslide win over Watt.
The Indianapolis quarterback, who missed the entire 2017 season with a shoulder injury, got 44 votes. That far outpaced the four votes for Houston's All-Pro edge rusher Watt. Redskins running back Adrian Peterson received two votes.
Luck's sensational return, in which he led the Colts to a 10-6 record, wild-card playoff berth and a postseason victory at Houston, erased any doubts that the 2012 top overall draft choice could be a force in the NFL again. He was second in the league with 39 touchdown passes, throwing for 4,593 yards. He established career highs in completions, attempts and percentage and was sacked a league-low 18 times.
""I truly believe there are players on every team, every roster that could be Comeback Player of the Year in their own ways,'' Luck said. ""Honestly, the best part was playing football again -- having fun playing football and being pain free.""
Andrew Luck's long-awaited return from shoulder surgery resulted in arguably his best season as a pro:
He's the first Indianapolis player to win the award.
Coach of the Year
In his first season as Bears coach, Matt Nagy won the league's top honor for his profession.
For taking the perennial also-ran Bears to a 12-4 record and the NFC North championship, Nagy earned 24 votes. That was well ahead of the Chargers' Anthony Lynn, who got 10 votes.
""I want to thank the AP for selecting me as the Coach of the Year for 2018, especially considering the other deserving coaches who had outstanding seasons,"" Nagy said in a statement. ""This recognition is not about me, it is about our coaching staff, our players, the entire organization and the great Chicago Bears fans. We won this together as a family.""
Nagy has overseen the development of quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who blossomed in his second pro season, and saw a defense befitting the ""Monsters of the Midway"" dominate opponents at times. He is the fifth Bears coach to win the award, joining team founder George Halas (1963, 1965), Mike Ditka (1985, 1988), Dick Jauron (2001) and Lovie Smith (2005).
In a season when many coaches did exceptional work, four others also received votes. The Colts' Frank Reich got eight, followed by the Chiefs' Andy Reid (five), the Seahawks' Pete Carroll (two) and the Saints' Sean Payton (one).
Assistant Coach of the Year
For his work as Bears defensive coordinator, Vic Fangio got the head-coaching gig in Denver. He was also named assistant coach of the year.
Fangio guided the Bears to a third-place ranking on defense and first against the run. He helped Mack, cornerback Kyle Fuller and safety Eddie Jackson become All-Pros. Chicago allowed a league-low 283 points.
Fangio received 25 votes, far ahead of Baltimore defensive coordinator Don Martindale, who got nine.

25926181,"The New England Patriots' 13-3 victory over the Los Angeles Rams averaged about 98.2 million viewers on CBS, the lowest since Super Bowl XLII averaged 97.4 million viewers after the 2007 season. The preliminary household rating of 41.1 was the lowest since Super Bowl XXXVII, played after the 2003 season.
This year's game was a defensive struggle after a record-setting season of offensive fireworks. The Patriots led 3-0 at halftime, and the Rams did not score until 2 minutes, 11 seconds remained in the third quarter. The teams' 16 combined points was the lowest total in Super Bowl history.
Super Bowl LIII drew a total audience of 100.7 million, CBS said in a statement. That figure includes television viewers on CBS and ESPN Deportes, along with digital and streaming services on CBS Interactive, NFL digital properties and Verizon mobile. ESPN Deportes averaged 473,000 viewers, according to Nielsen's data.
Viewership was especially low in New Orleans, where only 26.1 percent of the market tuned into the game, according to Nielsen's overnight numbers -- by far the lowest since New Orleans became a metered ratings market in 1998.
New Orleans typically ranks among the top markets in the country when it comes to the percentage of the metro population watching Super Bowls or NFL games in general. By comparison, Super Bowl LII drew a 53.0 rating in New Orleans. The lowest Super Bowl rating in New Orleans in recent history was a 48.4 two years ago -- when the rival Atlanta Falcons were in the game.
This year, however, New Orleans actually reveled in boycotting the Super Bowl across the city to make a statement against the officiating error that helped keep the Saints out of the game. Thousands of fans attended anti-Super Bowl events throughout the city, from the ""Boycott Bowl"" concert and ""Blackout and Gold"" second-line parade in the French Quarter to the ""anti-LIE Bowl"" block party uptown.

25910214,"The prospect of using the transition tag on the star running back creates an interesting situation, considering the fact that receiver Antonio Brown is likely to be traded, while Bell could possibly be back in Pittsburgh for 2019.
Pittsburgh's decision depends on how much another team would value Bell and whether the Steelers would be willing to match the offer sheet.
There also is a battle brewing between the NFL and and NFL Players Association over the value of what the transition tag would be on Bell if the Steelers did use it. Bell and the NFLPA will argue that the transition tag is close to $14.5 million based on the escalating value of tags, and the Steelers and the NFL will say it's closer to $9.5 million because Bell sat out this past season.
No player has ever been in a situation like this. If the league wins the ruling, it will add even more leverage to teams using franchise and transition tags. If the NFLPA wins, it will give players more rights if they decide to skip seasons when tagged.
Bell, who turns 27 later this month, skipped the entire 2018 season after declining to sign his franchise tender, leaving $14.5 million on the table.

25933365,"PHILADELPHIA -- Quarterback Nick Foles has informed the Eagles he is voiding his $20 million option for 2019, after the team notified him it would be picking up the option, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Foles must pay the Eagles $2 million to opt out.
Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz disputed some aspects of a recent critical article but admitted he could be a better teammate.
The move paves the way for the Eagles to place the franchise tag on Foles. They are expected to do so in an effort to then try to trade him, sources from other NFL teams who have been in touch with Philadelphia previously told Schefter.
The franchise tag number for quarterbacks is expected to be around $25 million for next season.
The Eagles have publicly committed to Carson Wentz as their starting QB moving forward. By placing the franchise tag on Foles, they would have an opportunity to receive compensation for Foles via trade while having a say on where he ends up. The price for Foles is expected to be around a third-round pick, according to Schefter.
Foles, the MVP of Super Bowl LII, stepped in again for the injured Wentz at the end of this past season and helped the Eagles to three straight regular-season wins and a playoff victory at the Chicago Bears in the wild-card round.
Foles, 30, completed 72 percent of his passes and threw for seven touchdowns and four interceptions in five regular-season games in 2018.

25973483,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Safety Eric Reid says the three-year deal worth slightly more than $22 million he signed with the Carolina Panthers on Monday should strengthen his collusion grievance against the NFL.
The NFL Players Association filed a collusion grievance against the NFL on Reid's behalf in May when he was not signed after the San Francisco 49ers opted to let their 2013 first-round pick become an unrestricted free agent.
The grievance, which is ongoing, alleged team owners and the league, influenced by President Donald Trump, colluded to prevent Reid's employment because of his protests against social injustice. Reid in 2016 became the first player to join former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick in kneeling during the national anthem.
Reid said the deal should help his case.
""If anything, it proves my point from last year. I didn't sign until a [few weeks into] the regular season,'' said Reid, signed by Carolina before the fourth game. ""This year I signed a more substantial contract over the same time period. I'm the same player.''
Reid doesn't hold out much hope that Kaepernick, who has not played since the 2016 season, will be signed.
""Knowing what I know, my hope tank is on E,'' Reid said. ""This is a leverage game, so we'll see what happens moving forward.''
Reid joined a group of celebrities who boycotted the recent Super Bowl in Atlanta as a show of support for Kaepernick and others protesting police brutality and racial injustice.
""I spent time with my family, did homework with my daughters, played cards,'' Reid said of how he spent Super Bowl Sunday. ""It was a family day.''
Reid continued to kneel last season after signing with the Panthers, who acquired him after starting safety Da'Norris Searcy was placed on injured reserve with a concussion. It did not become a distraction and Reid was supported by his teammates, although no other players kneeled.
Quarterback Cam Newton said at the time that getting Reid was a ""steal.''
""We have great players in this locker room and we've accepted him with open arms,"" Newton said. ""I was thinking to myself, I hope he was and is as excited as everyone is having him. He's a very young, talented football player that has a lot of talent left in his body. For him to be on our team is a great thing.
""I'm going to stand by him knowing none of that will be a distraction for us winning football games.""
Re-signing Reid became a priority after the season as the Panthers sought to keep a veteran presence in the secondary. Strong safety Mike Adams, who will turn 38 in March, has not been re-signed and Searcy's future is unclear.
Welcome back @E_Reid35‚ÄºÔ∏è#KeepPounding pic.twitter.com/93LaHR54Ma
""We always knew he was a solid football player, and he showed it to us,'' coach Ron Rivera told the team website.
Reid started the final 13 games last season, finishing with 73 tackles, five passes defensed, one interception and one sack.
But Reid's decision to re-sign before hitting the open market had little to do with loyalty to Carolina, the only team that took a chance on him last year.
""It's an interesting aspect in sports where people wonder how much loyalty plays a part,'' Reid said. ""For me, I don't see a lot of loyalty in this business. The Panthers could cut me tomorrow if they wanted to.
""The fact that they brought me in last year didn't play that much of a role.''
What played a factor was that Charlotte reminds Reid of where he grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and he got what he considered a fair market deal.
The average salary of the top 10 safeties in the league ranges from $7 million to $13 million a year. Reid's deal will average just over $7.3 million a year.
""I can envision my family being here during the season and being satisfied with the contract,'' Reid said when explaining why he signed early. ""If I wasn't satisfied with the contract I would have gone into free agency.''
Reid still has issues with the league, from his grievance to his assertion he was drug tested randomly seven times this past season. Reid believes the league targeted him with the drug tests and more than four fines for game violations, at least two that were overturned after appeal.
""The NFL released a statement saying I was not targeted, and I believe otherwise,'' Reid said
However, getting a new deal now instead of having to spend the offseason in doubt as he did a year ago has brought Reid ""peace of mind.''
""Yeah, it's been a long time coming with the way the CBA works with a fifth-year option and then [what happened] last year,'' Reid said. ""It gives my family peace of mind knowing where we'll be the next couple of years. I enjoyed being here.
""I like that it's low key here. It's not too busy. Traffic isn't crazy. I like the defense and the coaching staff, so I'm excited.''

25908741,"Saquon Barkley, described by some as a ""generational running back,"" is The Associated Press 2018 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.
Indianapolis Colts linebacker Darius Leonard was the winner of the Defensive Rookie of the Year award.
Barkley led the NFL with 2,024 yards from scrimmage this past season. He also set a rookie record with 91 receptions and made the Pro Bowl.
After becoming the second player in NFL history to throw for 50 touchdowns and more than 5,000 yards, first-year Chiefs starter Patrick Mahomes won the Most Valuable Player award in a landslide Saturday night.
Browns QB Baker Mayfield and Giants RB Saquon Barkley, the top two picks in last year's NFL draft, have a bet riding on the outcome of the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award.
Barkley, the second overall draft pick who rushed for 1,307 yards and 11 touchdowns behind a weak New York Giants offensive line, drew 26.5 votes from a nationwide panel of media members who regularly cover the league.
Barkley edged top overall draft pick Baker Mayfield, who earned 21.5 votes. In addition to the award, Barkley also will soon be sporting a chain -- courtesy of Mayfield -- as a result of a wager with the Cleveland Browns' rookie quarterback on the outcome.
""The loser's got to get someone else a chain,"" Barkley told Cleveland.com earlier this week. ""We get to pick the chain and we get to have fun with it because obviously everyone's talking about who's going to win.""
In a rarity, a guard, Quenton Nelson of the Indianapolis Colts got two votes in balloting announced at NFL Honors on Saturday.
‚Ä¢ Saquon Barkley became the third rookie in NFL history to have 2,000 scrimmage yards (Eric Dickerson in 1983 & Edgerrin James in 1999).
‚Ä¢  Barkley recorded a rookie RB-record 91 receptions, including a single-game franchise-record 14 catches in Week 2, also tied for the most by a rookie running back in league annals.
‚Ä¢ Barkley's six rushes of 50-plus yards this season were the most by a Giants player in a season since the merger in 1970, per Elias.
‚Ä¢ Barkley finished as the No. 1 running back in fantasy by 0.3 points over Christian McCaffrey.
Barkley also made a team-high 91 receptions -- an NFL record for a rookie running back -- for 721 yards, and his 2,028 yards from scrimmage led the league.
""This kid is a special player, a special talent,"" Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. ""He's such a big, powerful guy that has breakaway speed. Sometimes, it's impossible, but you kind of have to get two or three bodies on him. He's a tremendous running back, and a load to bring down.""
Barkley is the second Giants player in five seasons to win the award; wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. took it in 2014. They are the only Giants to win it.
Leonard, the second-round pick out of South Carolina State, led the Colts in tackles with a franchise-record 163 -- including 13 in a playoff victory over Houston. The All-Pro selection earned 29 votes from a nationwide panel of media members who regularly cover the league, nine in front of Los Angeles Chargers safety Derwin James.
Denver Broncos defensive end Bradley Chubb got the other vote in balloting announced at NFL Honors. Both James and Chubb was selected in the first 17 picks, while Leonard went 36th.
A dominant performer at an FCS school, Leonard impressed general manager Chris Ballard when Leonard made 19 tackles against eventual national champion Clemson in 2016. Leonard simply got better in college, and throughout his pro debut. He had seven sacks, six forced fumbles and two interceptions despite missing one game with a knee injury.
Leonard is the second Indianapolis player to take the defensive rookie award, joining linebacker Duane Bickett (1985).

He said: ""I'm just chilling, then boom, pop, full beer can right to the face.""
The same thing happened to Red Sox manager Alex Cora during October's parade in Boston to celebrate that team's World Series title. That prompted Mayor Marty Walsh to warn Patriots fans not to throw anything at the team.

25953625,"Caldwell is currently the most experienced coach on the Dolphins staff and he'll be a sounding board for Flores, a first-time head coach. Caldwell returns to the NFL after sitting out the 2018 season.
The Dolphins also officially named Chad O'Shea as offensive coordinator, Patrick Graham as defensive coordinator and Danny Crossman as special teams coordinator.
Flores, less than a week after holding the high-powered Rams offense to three points as the Patriots' defensive playcaller in Super Bowl LIII, nabbed three coaches off the Patriots' staff to join him: O'Shea (previously Patriots receivers coach), Josh Boyer as defensive pass game coordinator/cornerbacks coach (previously Patriots cornerbacks coach) and Jerry Schuplinski as assistant quarterbacks coach (previously same position with Patriots).
In his seven seasons as an NFL head coach with the Indianapolis Colts (2009-11) and Detroit Lions (2014-17), Caldwell had five winning seasons and four playoff appearances. He also won Super Bowls as an assistant coach with the Colts (Super Bowl XLI) and Baltimore Ravens (Super Bowl XLVII). Caldwell's expertise lies with quarterbacks, where he has helped lead Peyton Manning, Joe Flacco and Matthew Stafford to some of their best seasons.
""Jim is an incredible human being, a man of faith and a great football coach. His experience as a head coach will be invaluable for me,"" Flores said. ""Jim is a great teacher, highly organized and somebody that I have a lot of respect for.""
Caldwell also will be a key resource for O'Shea, who will be a first-time offensive coordinator. The two will work together to design an offense for the rebuilding Dolphins revolving around a new quarterback. Ryan Tannehill, the Dolphins' starter since 2012, is not expected to return to Miami in 2019.
Miami is currently retaining three assistant coaches from the Adam Gase era: running backs coach Eric Studesville, safety (previously defensive backs) coach Tony Oden and quality control coach Josh Grizzard.

25980647,"Long, 28, was released by the New York Jets last week after only one season of a four-year, $27.4 million deal he signed last offseason. Long would have been due a $3 million bonus last week if he had remained on the Jets' roster.
In the first significant roster move under new coach Adam Gase, the New York Jets announced Tuesday they are parting ways with center Spencer Long.
Financial terms of Long's contract with the Bills were not disclosed. Buffalo entered this offseason with about $80 million in salary-cap space and was expected to address their problematic offensive line. Starting right guard John Miller and right tackle Jordan Mills will both become unrestricted free agents in March, along with backup guard/center Ryan Groy.
Thank you Buffalo! Had an awesome visit can't wait to get to work. https://t.co/5YZwmiQM6T
The Jets had hoped Long would stabilize the center position, a weakness since Nick Mangold stopped playing in 2016, but the plan didn't materialize. Long played the second half of the season with a tendon injury in his right (snapping) hand, which affected his performance.
The low point came in a Week 9 loss to the Miami Dolphins during which Long was off-target on at least seven shotgun snaps. Then-Jets coach Todd Bowles didn't pull him until late in the game, resulting in a torrent of criticism. Long never played center again. When he returned to the lineup two weeks later, he played left guard, where he stayed for the rest of the season.
The Redskins selected Long in the third round of the 2014 draft. He has played in 53 games during his five-year career, including 44 starts.
The Bills on Tuesday also re-signed cornerback Lafayette Pitts to a one-year deal. Pitts, who played Buffalo's second-most special teams last season, was set to become a restricted free agent in March.

25925144,"Flores was signed to a five-year deal, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Of the eight new head coaches hired this winter in the NFL, Flores was the only one to receive five fully guaranteed years, according to the source.
Other head coach deals were mainly four years and included a team option for a fifth.
Dolphins general manager Chris Grier, in charge of his first coaching search, sought someone with similar beliefs of how to build a contender.
He decided on Flores, the 37-year-old Patriots de facto defensive coordinator who started his career the same way as Grier -- as a New England scout. That Patriots connection likely played a significant role as the Dolphins seek a way to dethrone their longtime rival.
""To be a head coach in this league is a dream come true, to be head coach of the Miami Dolphins is a dream come true. This is a great organization with a great history, with a great fan base and I'm excited to be here.""We go one-on-one with Head Coach Brian Flores pic.twitter.com/R7EmdEhbB9
Flores was the first person the Dolphins interviewed after they fired coach Adam Gase on Dec. 31. The New York Jets hired Gase as head coach 12 days later. The Dolphins  decided on Jan. 11 to offer the job to Flores but had to wait until New England's season ended to complete an agreement.
""I wasn't in a rush to become a head coach,"" Flores said. ""I had a good job in New England.""
While preparing for the Super Bowl, Flores also began to hire a Miami staff. The group is expected to include former Colts and Lions head coach Jim Caldwell as assistant head coach, Patriots receivers coach Chad O'Shea as offensive coordinator and Packers assistant Patrick Graham as defensive coordinator.
""Two things that stand out immediately when you meet Brian are his football intelligence and leadership skills,"" Grier said in a statement. ""Brian is widely respected throughout the NFL. He paid his dues in New England working in personnel, on offense, defense and special teams, which helped him build a great understanding of what it takes to win.
""If you talk with anyone who has played for him or worked with him, you will hear about his ability to lead and get the most out of people. Brian sets a high standard for his players and coaches and we are completely aligned with our vision on how to build a successful organization.""
Flores is also the first full-time minority coach in franchise history and one of four minority coaches currently in the NFL.
Flores takes over a team that seems headed for somewhat of a rebuild, as owner Stephen Ross alluded to after firing Gase.
""We're going to look to really build this organization based on our needs and if it takes a year or so -- two years, three years -- we are going to be there."" Ross said.
That means Flores is expected to get the time needed to overhaul the Dolphins' roster and culture to build a true contender. That will start with a decision at quarterback, as Ryan Tannehill's future is in peril. Grier said a decision on Tannehill's future hasn't been made yet and they haven't ruled out selecting a quarterback in the draft.
Flores is braced for the frustrations that come with rebuilding.
The Dolphins are bucking a trend by hiring with a head coach with a defensive background, and  believe Flores will be a genuine, accountable leader.
Eight teams have made their official head coach hires for 2019. Here's what you need to know on each.
""That's part of leadership -- dealing with adversity,"" he said. ""There's going to be some pain. There's pain for every team.""
As for his curtailed Super Bowl celebration, he wasn't complaining.
""No, this is not getting cheated at all,"" Flores said. ""That was a great experience, but I guess I've always been this way -- I look forward.""
Flores has coached offense, defense and special teams, along with a stint serving as a scout in New England. He had spent his entire coaching career -- since 2004 -- with the Patriots. He will have to defy the lack of success that has followed many Bill Belichick assistants when they leave for another head job. ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ
Flores is the Dolphins' 10th head coach (including interims) since 2004, and he will have to do what none of the others could -- lead the Dolphins out of mediocrity. Miami finished between 6-10 and 10-6 in each of the past 10 seasons, the only team in the NFL to do that. It went 7-9 in 2018, losing its last three games by an aggregate score of 100-41.
This is the Dolphins' first full-time, defensive-minded head coach hire since Nick Saban in 2005. Flores, a linebacker coach whose role got elevated to playcaller when Matt Patricia left to take the Detroit Lions head coach job in 2018, will have some young core defensive players to build around, like budding star cornerback Xavien Howard, versatile defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick and promising playmaking linebacker Jerome Baker. Safety Reshad Jones and Kiko Alonso are also strong established veterans to help the transition.
The Dolphins allowed 6,257 yards this past season, 29th in the NFL and the most in franchise history. The offense, which finished 31st, wasn't any better.
Ross reiterated that the Dolphins are taking a ""different direction,"" and it may take multiple years for Miami to be ready to compete for a championship.
The Dolphins also interviewed Cowboys defensive playcaller Kris Richard, Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, Saints defensive coordinator Dennis Allen and their own special teams coordinator, Darren Rizzi, for the head job. Ultimately, they decided Flores was the right man.
Flores is coming off maybe his best performance as a coach. He helped devise a scheme and called the plays for a Patriots defense that held Sean McVay's Rams to just three points in Super Bowl LIII, tied for fewest in Super Bowl history, and 260 total yards. To use McVay's own words, he was ""outcoached"" by Flores, Belichick and the Patriots defense.
After the Patriots'  win Sunday, Belichick credited Flores with making the blitz call that ended in a Jared Goff interception late in the fourth quarter. Goff said the Patriots defense had them ""completely guessing.""
Less than 24 hours later, Flores is now running his own show as Miami's coach.
""It has been a whirlwind 24 hours,"" Flores said with a smile at a news conference that drew two dozen cameras.
Among those attending the news conference were Flores' wife, Jennifer, their three children and his high school coach. Also on hand was the last quarterback to lead Miami to a Super Bowl, Dan Marino, in 1984, and the last quarterback to help the Dolphins win one, Bob Griese, in 1973.

25919475,"The future of football might be offense, but Bill Belichick showed on Sunday night that while he's still coaching defense isn't dead yet.
The Patriots and their quarterback are carving out a big spot in the Super Bowl history books after clinching their sixth title.
It wasn't the prettiest Super Bowl for fans of offense, but a fourth-quarter TD helped the Patriots beat the Rams for Brady's sixth title.
Brady finished the night 21-of-35 with 262 yards and one interception and helped set the Patriots up for their only touchdown with a 29-yard completion to tight end Rob Gronkowski.
It was Brady's sixth game-winning drive in the fourth quarter or overtime of the Super Bowl. No other quarterback has more than six game-winning drives in the postseason since 1970.
""It means a lot,"" Brady said of lifting the Patriots to their record-tying sixth Super Bowl. ""There's been a lot of guys that are a part of this journey, with this team, and it's just been so fun to be a part of it. You just do your best everyday. It's a challenging football environment, the pressure's always on for moments like this because you have to rise to the occasion.""
Brady had been tied with Pro Football Hall of Famer Charles Haley as the only players to win five Super Bowls. Haley was a member of San Francisco 49ers teams that won Super Bowl XXIII and XXIV, and later won three more Super Bowl rings after he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys.
Brady now also holds the record for most career wins, with 237. Indianapolis Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri, who is returning for a 24th season in 2019, has 236 career wins.
""He's a great quarterback and I'd certainly put him up there against anybody,"" coach Bill Belichick said of Brady going in to Super Bowl LIII. ""He's a great player, and he's been a great player for the New England Patriots. Certainly his record is unmatched. I'm glad he's my quarterback.""
Belichick joins George Halas and Curly Lambeau as the only head coaches with six NFL titles. In addition to winning six Super Bowls, Brady has been in the Super Bowl nine times, which is the most of any player in NFL history. John Elway, who started in five Super Bowls for the Denver Broncos, is the next quarterback on the list. Terry Bradshaw, Jim Kelly, Peyton Manning, Joe Montana and Roger Staubach are next, with four Super Bowl starts apiece.
""The guy has already accomplished so much, he's the best out there,"" Gronkowski said in the days leading up to the game, when asked what a sixth ring would mean to Brady's legacy. ""The way he competes, the way he prepares for the game, the way he practices every single week, it's just legendary. It makes him the greatest.""
Brady said all week leading up to the game that he doesn't take it for granted.
""It's definitely not like any other game, but in many ways, it's better than ever because these experiences are so once-in-a-lifetime. I've just been so lucky to be part of so many great teams,"" he said.

25909987,"After a Kansas City television station identified a fan shining a laser on Brady, Chiefs officials quickly worked to identify the fan by using videotape and eyewitnesses.
Patriots owner Robert Kraft wants to keep the team's ""symmetry"" and ""chemistry"" intact and is open to signing quarterback Tom Brady to another contract extension.
The NFL says it will look into a report that a laser was flashed at Patriots quarterback Tom Brady during the fourth quarter Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium.
""There's a lot of pride in Kansas City, and we and our fans thought, 'You don't do that here,'"" one Chiefs official told ESPN.
The Kansas City police department initially wanted to cite the fan with disorderly conduct, but Chiefs officials didn't feel those charges were strong enough and instead have been pushing for ""the harshest penalty possible,"" in the words of one source.
The Chiefs want this incident to deter fans from pointing a laser at players at future games, a violation that has more serious ramifications than many realize. Since last month's conference title game, members of the military have reached out to Brady to inform him that the lasers shined near his face could cause irreversible eye damage, according to another source.
One day after New England's overtime victory in Kansas City, a league spokesman confirmed that the NFL would look into the incident. A cameraman from Kansas City station KMBC shot video that showed a green dot flickering around Brady's shoulder and face.
Our photographer, Turner Twyman, caught someone pointing what appears to be a laser pointer in Tom Brady's face last night. Play between the ""muff"" that wasn't and Sorensen int. @NFL, @Patriots and @Chiefs all told me they weren't aware of the incident. pic.twitter.com/ejWBQ6i64C
Lasers are prohibited at NFL games, and security at Sunday's Super Bowl will be checking for them.
The NFL has dealt with the issue of lasers in the past, including a Monday night game in Mexico two years ago in which then-Texans quarterback Brock Osweiler was targeted multiple times.

25900410,"PITTSBURGH -- Antonio Brown delivered a brief message from the Super Bowl in his first public appearance since the Pittsburgh Steelers' season ended.
Trouble between the Steelers and Antonio Brown has been ""brewing for years,"" and a once unthinkable split is now possible. Here's how they got here.
Pro Bowl wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster compared the Steelers to the Kardashians during a Super Bowl week appearance on ESPN's First Take on Thursday.
""I just want to win,"" said Brown in a short interview posted on USA Today Sports' Twitter account. ""I just want to win, play with a team that's gonna win. That's all I want.""
""Doesn't matter where?"" the reporter asked.
""Doesn't matter where,"" replied Brown, wearing a blond-dyed mustache and hair with blonde and blue streaks.
Brown has communicated mostly through social media since the Week 17 drama that has left the Steelers exploring trade options for the All-Pro wide receiver. Brown frustrated the organization when he skipped work the Saturday before the season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals. Brown also had a flare-up in a midweek team setting. Sources said Brown believes he has been used as a scapegoat for the team's problems and is open to thriving in a new offense if that's the path the Steelers choose.
Brown has tweeted that the Steelers feel ""indifferent"" about him and used Instagram to post an edited photo of himself in a San Francisco 49ers jersey.
Steelers president Art Rooney II said Jan. 16 that he has made efforts to speak with Brown and would like to get his side of things.
""Obviously, [something] changed [the] last weekend of the season, and there is no other way to say it than I am very disappointed with where we are and what happened and don't have a lot of good explanations for it as we sit here today,"" Rooney told a group of Pittsburgh-area reporters.
Since then, there has been contact between both sides, though it's unclear whether Brown has spoken directly with Rooney. Agent Drew Rosenhaus told ESPN that ""we have shared our thoughts with the Steelers but will keep those discussions internal.""
The Steelers couldn't execute a trade until March 13, the start of the league year. Brown has a $2.5 million roster bonus due March 17.
Several team leaders spoke out in support of Brown at last week's Pro Bowl. They want him back in their locker room.
""I love the guy. I think the world of the guy. I love his competitiveness,"" defensive end Cam Heyward said. ""I'd love to have him on our team. That's all I can ask for. Now the ball's in his court.""

25941902,"""I'll use it as motivation, but the more important thing is winning football games,"" Mayfield said.
The two players are good friends, so Mayfield smiled when asked if Barkley had already used his bragging rights.
""Yeah, he has,"" Mayfield said. ""But we're not going to get into the detail yet.""
Mayfield and Barkley had a friendly wager on the honor, so now Mayfield has to buy Barkley a chain. Even there he lapsed into a barb, poking fun at Barkley's muscular quadriceps.
""It'll say 'Quads' on it,"" Mayfield said. ""Not 'Sa-quads' but just 'Quads.' The two extra letters in there cost a little bit extra money, so we'll stick with just 'Quads.'""
The rivalry and competition are clearly friendly.
""Yeah, it's more frustrating than anything because Saquon, that's my guy, and he'll hold it over my head forever,"" Mayfield said. ""But you know what, I'll use that as motivation, and I'll be better in the long run.""
Mayfield was in town after spending the week at the Super Bowl in Atlanta. He spent time during the week at the Browns' facility meeting with his new offensive coaches, including coordinator Todd Monken. He was joined at the banquet by his fianc√©e, Emily Wilkinson, whom he will wed in July.
Mayfield has talked about the importance of taking time away from the game, but said he will soon return to the gym -- just not with a quarterback specialist.
""No, I'm not going to have any guy swiping a broom at my feet in the ocean, that type of quarterback training,"" he said. ""I don't believe in that. I'll go to a normal gym where I trained last year. I don't need some guy to try and teach me how to throw. I'll have a guy that pushes me in workouts. Has other athletes in there. The intensity's up. It's a working environment.""
Mayfield also spoke about his appearance in the NFL 100 commercial that aired during Super Bowl LIII -- noting that New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady did not use props when he told Mayfield to hold his championship rings.
""Those were the real rings,"" Mayfield said Wednesday. ""They are heavy.""
Mayfield was one of several present-day NFL stars to join all-time greats commemorating the NFL's upcoming 100th anniversary. In the madcap video, Brady goes to join in banquet room football and gives his rings to Mayfield, who was seated next to him.
""Obviously, being a part of something like that is very special,"" Mayfield said. ""Some of the names in that, if you told me last year that I would be a part of a commercial like that, I would've told you you're absolutely lying.""

25918235,"ATLANTA -- So much for a shootout in Super Bowl LIII.
The New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 on Sunday night, and the 16 combined points set a record for the lowest-scoring game in Super Bowl history.
The previous mark of 21 combined points, set by the undefeated Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins at Super Bowl VII, had stood for 46 years. The Patriots' winning total was also one fewer point than the previous low, set by the Dolphins in their 14-7 win in 1973.
The future of football might be offense, but Bill Belichick showed on Sunday night that while he's still coaching defense isn't dead yet.
With 16 combined points, Super Bowl LIII was a yawnfest. But how about Cowboys-Dolphins in 1972? Or Niners-Broncos? Let's consider five others that are among the worst of all time.
An American football championship was played Sunday night, and LeBron James and the rest of the NBA kind of took notice.
The Rams tied the Dolphins' record-low total from their 24-3 loss in Super Bowl VI, and they also joined that Miami team as the only ones not to score a touchdown in a Super Bowl.
The over/under for this year's Super Bowl closed at 56, the third-highest in the game's history, but that mark was doubtful after the Patriots entered halftime with a mere 3-0 lead.
The three points combined for the second-lowest-scoring half in a Super Bowl, just shy of the record set in Super Bowl IX in 1975, when the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings combined for two points.
During the regular season, the Chiefs (18.6 points per half) and the Rams (17.4 points per half) were the two highest-scoring first-half offenses in the league. But early on, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was uncharacteristically shaky, going 15-of-25 for 160 yards in the first half while throwing an interception on his first pass attempt. Rams quarterback Jared Goff also struggled, completing 5 of 12 passes for 52 yards before the half.
The Rams became the 13th team to be shut out in the first half of the Super Bowl. None went on to win. The Patriots are the third team to shut out their opponent in the first half of both the conference championship and Super Bowl, along with the 1973 Dolphins and 2000 Baltimore Ravens. All three teams won the Super Bowl.
This was only the second playoff game since 2001 that had three or fewer combined first-half points. The Vikings and Seattle Seahawks combined for three in the 2015 wild-card round.
Tim Hasselbeck says that the Rams' poor offense is the reason that they lost the Super Bowl.
The Patriots' defense also sizzled in the first half of its past two games -- against the Kansas City Chiefs and Rams. The unit did not allow any points in those games, while opponents ran 38 plays for 89 yards.
To break through against the Rams, the Patriots' offense made an adjustment and went big in the fourth quarter. According to NFL Next Gen Stats, New England ran its first play with two running backs and two tight ends with 8:50 left, during the drive that led to the game-winning touchdown. From there, New England used two running backs and two tight ends on seven of their final 14 offensive plays and averaged 11.9 yards.
On the night, 45 percent of the Rams' 60 plays went for zero or negative yards -- the second highest percentage for the Rams in a game this season, after their 15-6 loss to the Bears in Week 14.
Los Angeles failed on its first eight third-down opportunities, and Goff finished 3-of-10 passing on third down for the worst percentage in his career. Goff also went 0-for-5 with an interception on passes thrown 20 yards or more downfield, tied for his most attempts without a completion on those passes in his career.
The Patriots' defense pressured Goff on 38 percent of his dropbacks, and the young quarterback finished 3-of-12 when under duress. That's tied for the worst completion percentage for any QB that threw at least 10 passes under pressure in a Super Bowl. Meanwhile, the Rams only pressured Brady on 14 percent of his dropbacks.
One of the few bright spots for the Rams came in the third quarter as punter Johnny Hekker set a Super Bowl record with a 65-yard punt, narrowly eclipsing a 64-yarder from Patriots punter Ryan Allen four years ago.
Hekker had plenty of practice. His seven first-half punts were the most before the half in his seven-year career. He finished with nine punts, two shy of the record set by the New York Giants' Brad Maynard in 2001.
When the Rams did finally put some points on the board in the third quarter, they needed Greg Zuerlein to kick a 53-yard field goal -- 1 yard short of the longest ever in a Super Bowl, set by Buffalo's Steve Christie at Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994.

25937490,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- In a move that has been anticipated for several weeks, the New England Patriots are moving toward hiring Greg Schiano for their coaching staff, league sources tell ESPN.
Schiano will be given the title of defensive coordinator, according to The Boston Globe.
Four months after the city celebrated its fourth Red Sox title in 15 years, an estimated 1.5 million fans lined the parade route in Boston to fete Tom Brady and the Patriots for their sixth Super Bowl crown.
The Patriots didn't have an official defensive coordinator in 2018, but Brian Flores was their defensive playcaller on game day and spearheaded the game-planning process. Flores was officially hired as Miami Dolphins head coach Monday.
That was also the same day that Schiano was flying into Boston, according to sources, which reflected how his addition to the staff in some capacity was weeks in the making.
Once the former Ohio State defensive coordinator announced he wasn't returning to the Buckeyes in 2019 to pursue opportunities in the NFL, it was widely assumed he would land with Bill Belichick and the Patriots.
Schiano is a longtime friend of Belichick's and coached Belichick's son Steve at Rutgers for one season. He also coached current Patriots defensive backs Devin McCourty, Jason McCourty and Duron Harmon.
Schiano was on the cusp of being named University of Tennessee head coach in 2017. But the university reversed course after public outcry among Tennessee fans, with people citing his connection to the Jerry Sandusky era at Penn State. Belichick had offered his public support for Schiano.
""I think Greg's a tremendous coach, I've learned an awful lot from him,"" Belichick said at the time. ""Had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with him when he was at Rutgers. ... He's one of the very best coaches in our profession. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Greg and the way he runs the program and the job he does.""

He also climbed Mount Kilimanjaro with other NFL players and some U.S. military veterans to raise money to build clean water wells in East Africa.
A year ago, Long donated his entire salary to support education in cities where he has played: St. Louis, Boston and Philadelphia.
In addition to the award, the NFL will donate $250,000 to the The Chris Long Foundation, which includes programs focusing on clean water, military appreciation, homelessness and youth.

25921886,"ATLANTA -- Leading up to Super Bowl LIII, Sean McVay said he needed to get running back Todd Gurley II involved in the game.
On Sunday, in a 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the Los Angeles Rams coach failed to do so.
Two weeks after Gurley, the highest-paid running back in NFL history, was limited to five touches and 13 total yards in a victory over the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship Game, Gurley had 11 touches for 34 total yards in the Super Bowl.
""It's cool, man,"" Gurley said after the game. ""It's a team sport. There's 11 people on the field. Everyone can't touch the ball.""
The Rams have plenty of contract decisions to make on defense this offseason, but the future looks bright after a Super Bowl berth.
After his Rams failed to score a touchdown in Super Bowl LIII, quarterback Jared Goff called the 13-3 defeat to the Patriots ""the toughest loss I ever had.""
In a season that started with a four-game suspension, Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman closed a New England championship run as MVP of Super Bowl LIII.
The Rams finished with 260 total yards of offense, including 62 rushing yards. Running back C.J. Anderson, whom the Rams signed in mid-December, rushed for 22 yards on seven carries.
""There was some different situations, you could always look back, certainly that is going to be something I'm sure I'll say, 'I wish I could have got him more involved,'"" McVay said. ""The film is always a good chance to go back and look at it, and I know there is a handful of decisions that I'm going to want back, for sure.""
Quarterback Jared Goff said he would ""love to get [Gurley] the ball,"" but added, ""That's not my decision.""
Gurley, who signed a four-year, $60 million contract before the season, was sidelined for the final two games of the regular season because of inflammation in his left knee. He returned in a divisional-round win over the Dallas Cowboys and rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries.
But speculation regarding Gurley's health grew when he made two uncharacteristic mistakes early in the NFC Championship Game and played a minimal role, then was unable to find a rhythm in the Super Bowl.
After the game Sunday, Gurley said he was ""fine,"" and added that he had an MRI on his knee after a Week 15 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, during which he was sidelined for a series in the second half.
""I felt good,"" Gurley said. ""Whenever my name is called to get in, I'm ready.""
In the first quarter, Gurley was limited to one touch, a 2-yard carry. He had consecutive carries in the second quarter for a combined eight yards. In the second half, Gurley rushed for a 16-yard gain, then later had a 13-yard run, but it was called back because of a holding penalty.
""The reality is that we didn't get a lot of plays off in general until you get into some of those known passing situations towards the end,"" McVay said. ""The holding call was a really tough one for us. We had a good drive going, Todd makes a nice cutback run on a tight zone and that it puts us at first-and-20. Those kinds of plays seem like they continuously presented themselves throughout the night, and it never really enabled us to get in a rhythm. That was really tough.""
In 14 regular-season games, Gurley rushed for 1,251 yards and scored a league-best 21 touchdowns.

""But at the same time, if I try to be Sean McVay, I'm going to fail. To be quite honest with you, we're different people.

Taylor and McVay both come from offensive backgrounds, and Taylor plans to call his own plays, as McVay does. But even if he wanted to emulate McVay, it would be difficult considering their personalities are different.
""Sean is a very dynamic personality,"" Taylor said. ""He walks in front of a room and he energizes that room. And that's Sean's personality. I'm a little more reserved. ...

Sean is another example of doing it the right way and good things will happen.""
McVay told reporters on Tuesday that he doesn't anticipate Taylor taking any assistants with him from the Rams' staff. Taylor was mum on any specific candidates, but said he wanted ""great teachers, concise communicators, outside-the-box thinkers and people who are not afraid to deviate from the norm.""
Taylor said he was more interested in the type of people being hired than the specific schemes they might bring with them, which is also something he learned during his time in Los Angeles.
""Everyone felt valued. No idea was dumb or too great to be a part of the plan,"" he said. ""Everybody felt like their role was important. It's easy to come to work every single day when you feel like there is value to what you are doing and you feel appreciated, so you try to establish that same culture there.""

25927611,"ATLANTA -- Julian Edelman was choking up, on the verge of tears, and needed a second on Sunday to try to gather himself, to put what had just happened in perspective. He crouched down, in the center of a chaotic sea of gleeful celebration, and began playing with pieces of confetti at his feet. The moment seemed almost too big to process. The kid who used to cry in his father's arms at night, cursing his family genes because he was the shortest player on every team he played on, had somehow grown up to win the Most Valuable Player award in Super Bowl LIII.
As Edelman struggled to process his moment, a small but vocal group of football fans across America decided to try to make it into something much, much bigger. Inexplicably, a somewhat absurd debate broke out:
Is Edelman a Hall of Famer?

Normally it's foolish to elevate these kinds of debates above the mindless, bubbling content bog that is Twitter and sports talk radio because it has become increasingly difficult to separate the sincerity of people's arguments in those mediums from boredom, trolling or pleas for attention. But Edelman's unlikely Hall of Fame candidacy gained a bit of credibility this week when it was backed by some surprising allies: Jerry Rice and Boomer Esiason.
""The guy is clutch in the biggest of games,"" Esiason said in the buildup to Super Bowl LIII. ""I don't know what else to tell you. He is, in my eyes, truly the definition of a Hall of Famer: make the play when the play needs to be made in the biggest games to win the game.""
Rice, the only receiver in NFL history with more postseason yards than Edelman, also said that Edelman deserves Canton consideration.
The fact that Edelman's potential enshrinement is even a topic of discussion, at this stage of his career, should probably be cited by future historians as the perfect example of how short our attention spans grew to be in 2019. We are prisoners of the moment, and the moment is tricking us into making silly, unsupportable arguments.
Take a bow, Bill Belichick and Brian Flores. This Pats win over the Rams was fueled by the greatest defensive performance in Super Bowl history.
You might not like it, but you're watching the greatest dynasty in sports history. And it's time to appreciate it, whether or not you root for the Pats.
Is Edelman one of the best postseason players of all time? Certainly, especially if you consider what a big role he played in Super Bowl wins for the Patriots against the Seahawks (he caught the decisive touchdown), the Falcons (he made a preposterous circus catch in the fourth quarter during New England's wild comeback) and the Rams (he was his team's only effective offensive player for much of the night). But you're leaning pretty heavily on the word ""fame"" if you think those moments should earn him a spot in Canton. This is not Kurt Warner, a player who was briefly the best at his position. Edelman has never made a Pro Bowl.
On top of that, any argument on Edelman's behalf seems to conveniently forget or ignore the fact that he was suspended the first four games of the 2018 season after testing positive for a banned substance in the offseason. Now, it's safe to assume that, after he missed the entire 2017 season with a torn ACL, any use of PEDs would have been an attempt to aid his recovery. But it's even safer to say that any Edelman candidacy, which is already statistically sketchy considering he's 248th all time in receiving yards (5,390) and 148th all time in catches (499), would be significantly hampered -- if not torpedoed -- by this elephant in the room.
Even if you believe, as many do, that the modern NFL has become so violent that players ought to be able to take whatever they want to stay on the field, it would be an incredible insult to every NFL wide receiver who insisted on playing clean if Edelman's best argument included a season in which he served a suspension for not following the rules. Imagine how it must feel for former Rams wide receiver Isaac Bruce to see arguments in favor of Edelman. Bruce racked up 1,024 receptions, 15,208 yards and 91 touchdowns -- and he has been passed over three times.
It also says a lot about this era that, in response to a bit of hyperbolic support for Edelman, many of us are compelled to focus on his limitations rather than his accomplishment, just as he has reached what will likely be the pinnacle of his career, catching 10 passes for 141 yards in his third Super Bowl win. The Patriots suspected that the Rams were going to struggle to match up with Edelman on Sunday, in part because he is so good at disguising his routes and finding holes in zone coverage.
""He works very hard at making a lot of things look the same, even if they're different,"" Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said after the game. ""He's got countermoves to his moves, he's got great releases, and he knows how to battle. At the end of the day, if you're playing receiver, and you want the ball, you'd better get open. It doesn't matter how. Sometimes he punches defenders, sometimes he pushes off, sometimes he runs his route shorter than it should be, but he's always open. He understands the game, and he's given us every single thing we've ever asked of him -- and then some. It doesn't surprise me tonight that he played the way he did.""
In truth, there has never been a player quite like Edelman in the modern era of the NFL. He might not be the best slot receiver of this era, but he's definitely in the conversation, and that's a remarkable feat for someone whose NFL chances once hung by such a thin thread that he strongly considered becoming a fireman after college.
When the Patriots took a flier on him in the seventh round of the 2009 draft, he would stay at the facility so late at night that the Patriots equipment guys had to kick him out when they locked up. ""I just loved being there,"" Edelman said. ""I'd stay there every night looking at my helmet because I loved it so much.""
It's also likely that none of this would have taken shape had Tom Brady not been restless one offseason while living on the West Coast, when he dialed up Edelman to see if he wanted to play catch. They were teammates, in a sense, but they barely knew each other. Brady was already NFL royalty; Edelman was trying to cling to a roster spot. All Edelman could think was, ""I used to pretend to be you when I was playing touch football with my friends back in eighth grade.""
Everything you need this week:
‚Ä¢ 2018 playoffs coverage ¬ª
‚Ä¢ Full schedule ¬ª | Full standings ¬ª
‚Ä¢ 2019 draft order: Every first-round pick ¬ª
More NFL coverage ¬ª
That first session, Edelman ran so hard and caught so many passes that he puked afterward. Brady was impressed. A brotherhood began to take shape. ""It's a bond that was borne over hard work, trust and respect,"" McDaniels said. ""Julian matched his work ethic and showed him he could trust him over time. You don't get that the first day or even the first year.""
Every time the Patriots' coaching staff told him that his spot on the roster was tenuous, Edelman understood that Brady's growing faith in him might be what saved his job. Whether it was true or not, he told himself that one dropped pass in practice or a game might be the difference between having a long NFL career and working alongside his father, Frank, in the family's auto mechanic shop in Mountain View, California.
""He's a fighter, man,"" Brady said. ""I'm just so proud of him. He's been an incredible player for this team in the playoffs, and he just cemented himself, again, in the history of the NFL for what his accomplishments are.""
Edelman was so worried about saving money early in his career that he and teammate Matthew Slater rented a house in Foxborough together and lived like college kids, sharing expenses and household chores. ""He was a terrible roommate,"" Slater joked Sunday night. ""Didn't take the trash out, always leaving dishes around.""
But Slater didn't mind, in the long run, because of the conversations they often ended up having late into the night, sharing their doubts and fears about living on the margins of an NFL roster. In 2011, when the Patriots asked Edelman and Slater to shift to the defensive side of the ball, they figured it was a bad sign for their career prospects.
""That was a pretty low point,"" Slater said. ""We just kept telling each to keep working hard, keep believing we can do this, and maybe one day it will work out for us. ... To see us go from a couple of California kids living together to try and save a buck to him being the Super Bowl MVP is pretty special.""
Edelman liked living with Slater so much that, after four years, when Slater got married and decided to move out, Edelman told him to ask his wife if he could have a room in their new place.
""My wife was like, 'No way are we living with Julian,'"" Slater said. ""And Julian was like, 'No, tell her we can make this work.' But seriously, I love him like a brother, man. My wife loves him. My kids love him. He's been there for so many big moments in my life. I'm so appreciative for our friendship.""
In the end, whether Edelman makes it to the Hall of Fame seems almost irrelevant, considering that Brady will go down as the NFL's best quarterback of all time, and you can't tell the story of Brady's career (particularly the back half) without bringing up Edelman. When the two men embraced on the field after the game, with fresh confetti sticking to their uniforms and landing on Edelman's unkempt beard, it was clear how much their relationship has come to mean.
""The hug was just two Bay Area boys that love football, love to compete and are living out our dreams,"" Edelman said, getting sentimental before closing with an affectionate zinger. ""I think he held me. I didn't hold him.""
After the game, in the Patriots' locker room, New England owner Robert Kraft presented the team with a humidor full of 50-year-old cigars, encouraging the players to each grab one as they made their way to the afterparty. Kraft insisted that Edelman go first since he was the game's MVP, and Edelman was happy to oblige, snipping off the end with a cutter and popping it into his mouth.
It was still in his mouth 15 minutes later when he made his way toward the exit, grinning like a man who didn't give a damn about whatever his legacy might be but was happy to bask in the improbability of the present.

25931165,"Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Antonio Brown was involved in a January domestic dispute, the Hollywood Police Department in South Florida confirmed to ESPN on Tuesday.
Hollywood Police, which investigated the dispute, will not have further comment until it has more details, according to spokeswoman Miranda Grossman.
""The allegations are baseless and false,"" Brown's lawyer, Darren Heitner, said in a statement to ESPN. ""It's unfortunate that the media is trying to use distractions like this and prior stories in an effort to tarnish my client's name and reputation. We have no further comment.""
The Steelers issued a statement saying they are aware of the alleged incident and are ""still in the process of gathering more information.""
This is Brown's second recent legal issue in South Florida, where he was born and raised.
In October, he faced two lawsuits from an April incident during which Brown allegedly yelled at security and threw items off an apartment balcony, according to documents obtained by ESPN.
A guardian of a 2-year-old boy is suing Brown for ""intentional infliction of emotional distress and assault"" after items flung from the 14th floor of the Mansions at Acqualina nearly hit the child, according to Miami-Dade County court filings.
Those cases are in the process of being resolved.
Brown, 30, has been one of the NFL's most productive players, with a league-record six consecutive 100-catch seasons. However, the Steelers are considering trading Brown after he failed to show up to work the day before the season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Earlier that week, Brown was involved in a heated dispute at practice; according to multiple reports, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was involved in that incident.

25932328,"We got Jon Gruden's return to the Oakland Raiders, where he just went and traded everyone (not literally). We saw Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes take over the league with sidearm, underarm, right-handed and even left-handed passes.
New Orleans Saints QB Drew Brees broke records, and the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams treated us to the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever.
Heck, we even saw the Cleveland Browns win a game.
But how much of this year do you remember?

25976087,"And it comes weeks after Quinn said Stafford was the team's quarterback and would continue to be the team's quarterback.
""We'll consider any position in the draft at any point in time, whether it's the eighth overall pick or we have multiple picks later in the draft,"" Quinn said. ""We're in a position now with the eighth overall pick that the whole draft board is really wide open to us. We're not going to really eliminate any prospects.
""In previous years, at least my last couple years here, we've drafted anywhere from 16 to 22 I believe. It's a little bit different for us this year. There's a few more players that are going to be available and if there's a quarterback out there that we deem could help us this year or in the future, we'll never close the door on that.""
The top quarterback prospects in this year's draft are Ohio State's Dwayne Haskins and Oklahoma's Kyler Murray.
The topic came up as a question from a fan during the team's annual season-ticket member summit, where fans lined up to ask questions of Quinn, team president Rod Wood and head coach Matt Patricia in the context of how teams in the league have been successful building with quarterbacks on rookie contracts offering more cap flexibility.
In recent years, Seattle (Russell Wilson) and the Los Angeles Rams (Jared Goff) have made the Super Bowl with quarterbacks on rookie contracts and the Eagles (Carson Wentz) and Chiefs (Patrick Mahomes) have also built consistent contenders around signal-callers on rookie deals.
Patricia said sometimes those teams are built to be stacked on one side of the ball and when the quarterback has to be paid, they'll have to take hits at other positions. Patricia said ""it's tricky water to kind of tread there when you kind of have those situations and we're trying to balance the overall foundation of the team so that you're competitive all the way across the board.""
Stafford is slated to make $29.5 million against the cap next season -- $19 million of it guaranteed. If, as expected, Stafford is on the roster of the fifth day of the 2019 league year, he'll have $6 million guaranteed to him in 2020.
The 31-year-old is coming off one of the worst seasons of his career, completing 66.1 percent of his passes for 3,777 yards, 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. His yardage total was his lowest since the 2010 season; his touchdowns the fewest since 2012 and interceptions highest since 2015. His QBR of 53.8 was his lowest since 2014.
After last season, Quinn said he believed the Lions could win a Super Bowl with Stafford and backed what Patricia had said earlier, that they believe in Stafford as their quarterback.
""Matthew Stafford is our quarterback,"" Quinn said on Jan. 4. ""He will be our quarterback here. Listen, this guy is a really talented player and myself, the coaches, need to put him in better situations to allow him to use his skill set.""
That's something Quinn and Patricia reiterated at the summit, saying they needed to upgrade the tight end position -- calling it a priority -- as well as find more offensive and defensive playmakers.

25924806,"CINCINNATI -- The Cincinnati Bengals have hired Los Angeles Rams quarterbacks coach Zac Taylor as their head coach, the team announced Monday.
The Bengals homed in on Taylor several weeks ago, but they could not hire him until the Rams were eliminated from the playoffs. Los Angeles advanced to Super Bowl LIII and lost 13-3 to the New England Patriots on Sunday.
Taylor, 35, will be the second-youngest coach in the league behind his former boss, 33-year-old Sean McVay. Taylor, the 10th head coach in Bengals history, is expected to hire Oakland Raiders quarterbacks coach Brian Callahan, 34, as his offensive coordinator.
""I am happy and fortunate to join the Cincinnati Bengals as head coach,"" Taylor said in a statement. ""This is a great organization with good people and a rich history, and I am excited to get started. I am looking to add to that history by setting high standards, and holding everyone here accountable to those standards. There is a lot of work to do, and this is Day 1. We're going to attack every day with enthusiasm to get this team ready to go.""
Taylor has been with the Rams since 2017, when he was hired as an assistant wide receivers coach before his promotion to quarterbacks this coach season. He previously spent one year in the college ranks as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the University of Cincinnati. Taylor was also with the Miami Dolphins as an assistant from 2012 to 2015 and was the Dolphins' interim offensive coordinator at the end of the 2015 season.
Taylor's hire could be good news for Andy Dalton: He had a successful start to the season under new quarterbacks coach Alex Van Pelt, who is expected to stay in Cincinnati. Dalton didn't sustain his success due to numerous injuries on offense. Taylor's work with Rams quarterback Jared Goff was praised this year, as Goff posted the best numbers of his career during a Super Bowl season.
Whether the inexperienced Taylor is the right move will be determined, but the Bengals made progress simply by trying something new.
""Zac's been great for me. First of all, him playing the position, being a quarterback, is something I think is extremely valuable as far as different things that you can't know or won't ever know [unless you played],"" Goff said last week of Taylor, who started for two seasons at Nebraska. ""He can relate in that way where he's done it and he understands it, and he's also been around in different systems and understands different things.
""I think his communication as well, something that Sean is so good at, I think in the same way Zac is so good at communication and being open and honest, and willing to listen, even if it's the wrong things, he's willing to listen, and he has a bright future.""
The Bengals are starting a new era for the franchise by essentially cleaning house and going with an offensive coach after standing by Marvin Lewis, who had a defensive background, for 16 seasons.
It's a dramatic shift for an organization whose previous three coaches were all at least 45 at the time of their hiring. The Bengals named 32-year-old Dave Shula as head coach in 1992, but he was fired midseason in 1996 following four losing seasons.
This is also the second straight hire outside of the organization. Before the 2003 hiring of Lewis, who was the Baltimore Ravens' defensive coordinator, the Bengals had not gone outside of the organization since Mike Brown took over the team in 1991.
The Bengals parted ways with Lewis in January. Although Lewis took the Bengals to the playoffs seven times, including five straight years between 2011 and 2015, he failed to win a postseason game. The Bengals have not won a playoff game since the 1990 season.
Declining ticket sales were likely a factor in the decision after attendance severely dipped in 2018 after three straight non-winning seasons.
This is also the first hire in which Brown's daughter Katie Blackburn took a primary role. Brown headed the previous search in 2003. Blackburn will inherit the Bengals one day and has taken the role in running the majority of day-to-day operations alongside her husband, Troy Blackburn, and Brown's son, Paul.
""Zac is a bright coach with an offensive mind and background, which is important to have in today's NFL,"" Mike Brown said. ""And he's young. He embraces new ideas and new ways to do things, which will be a good thing for us. I believe our team will be exciting and fun to watch with him at the helm.""
In addition to Van Pelt, special-teams coordinator Darrin Simmons will stay on the Bengals staff.
ESPN's Lindsey Thiry contributed to this report.

25976163,"""I think Jon Gruden is an excellent choice for that show,"" Lions coach Matt Patricia said. ""I think the Oakland Raiders and everything they've got going on right now would be fantastic viewing for everybody to watch.""
Gruden responded to Patricia's comments in a text to ESPN's Paul Gutierrez, writing: ""Lol.""
Patricia, then asked if appearing on the show would be like a weeks-long dentist visit for root canals, briefly sighed before saying: ""Yeah,"" and that ""I definitely think I would get a lot of phone calls from my mom at night if that show was on.""
Lions general manager Bob Quinn said Monday the club is open to taking a quarterback with the No. 8 pick in the draft if it deems someone worthy -- even with veteran Matthew Stafford on the roster.
Lions general manager Bob Quinn said that if Detroit is playing the ""Hard Knocks"" team that season, someone in the Lions' scouting department actually watches and DVRs the show to try to learn about the featured team's scheme and personnel. Quinn said he knows other NFL teams do it, including the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.
""So, it's real. Is it going to be a matter of a win and loss, I'm not sure,"" Quinn said. ""But we take the stuff that we do behind our doors pretty privately and pretty securely, so that's something that is definitely a factor.""
Quinn later said, ""Nobody wants to do it. Except Oakland.""
The Lions, Raiders, San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants and Washington Redskins are the five teams that cannot say no to ""Hard Knocks"" in 2019.
A team doesn't have to be on the show if it meets one of the following exemptions:
1. They have a first-year head coach
2. They've appeared in the playoffs in the past two seasons
3. They have appeared on ""Hard Knocks"" in the past 10 years.
The Raiders did not immediately respond to a request for comment by ESPN on Monday night.
