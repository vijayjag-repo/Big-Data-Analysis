26263030,"The addition of free agent Le'Veon Bell, who agreed to a four-year, $52.5 million contract late Tuesday night, made Crowell expendable. The Jets were planning to release Crowell even if they didn't sign Bell. This leaves Bell, Elijah McGuire and Trenton Cannon as their top three backs. Bilal Powell, the longest-tenured player on last season's team, is a free agent and not likely to return.

Crowell, who turned 26 in January, was one-and-done with the Jets. After four seasons with the Cleveland Browns, he signed a three-year, $12 million contract ($4 million guaranteed at signing) and became the starting running back last season.
He rushed for 685 yards, six touchdowns and a 4.8-yard average, but one-third of his production for the season came in one game. During a Week 5 victory over the Denver Broncos, he set the franchise record with 219 rushing yards.
Remarkably, he needed only 15 carries -- a 14.6 per-carry average. It was the highest average in a game (minimum 15 attempts) by a player in NFL history.
Former Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell, who shocked the NFL by sitting out the entire 2018 season on the franchise tag, plans to sign a four-year, $52.5 million deal with the Jets, a league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Crowell's season dipped sharply after his record-setting day, as he eclipsed 49 yards only once for the remainder of the year. He battled foot and ankle injuries and finished on injured reserve.
He created national headlines with an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty in Week 3 at Cleveland. After scoring against his former team, Crowell celebrated by pretending to wipe his rear end with the ball, which he threw to the ground.
Crowell received a public rebuke from then-coach Todd Bowles. Crowell was fined $13,369 by the NFL, but he parlayed the crude gesture into an endorsement deal with a company that sells toilet wipes for men.
In 2016, Crowell sparked a controversy when he posted on his Instagram account an illustration of a police officer being stabbed in the neck by a hooded figure. It was his response to the fatal shootings of two black men by police officers. A day later, five Dallas officers were killed by sniper fire. Crowell later apologized and donated a game check to the police department.
In five seasons, Crowell has 3,803 rushing yards and 27 touchdowns.

26264719,"The up-and-coming Cleveland Browns were willing to do what the fading New York Giants wouldn't: take a chance on Odell Beckham Jr.'s talent and hope his baggage doesn't weigh down the team.
""I know Odell is very passionate,"" Browns general manager John Dorsey said on a conference call. ""I know he is competitive. I know he can help this football team, and if you get a chance to acquire a guy like that, you know what, take a shot at it. We acquired him.""
While the rest of the AFC North is dismantled, a Browns team that couldn't win a game in 2017 is looking quite formidable.
The superstar receiver is headed to Cleveland, leaving behind a total rebuild in New York. Bill Barnwell dissects both sides of the deal.
Beckham was traded to the Browns along with defensive lineman Olivier Vernon for safety Jabrill Peppers, guard Kevin Zeitler and first- and third-round picks in this year's draft. The trade sent shock waves through the NFL, as the Giants gave up one of the most talented players in the league.
""We all understand the magnitude of his ability to play the game of football,"" Dorsey said.
Despite giving Beckham a five-year, $90 million contract last August and saying they didn't sign him to trade him, the Giants did just that, eating a considerable amount of money. There was no clear final straw, but Beckham had been a polarizing figure for years. There was the video from Paris of Beckham lounging on a bed with a woman, a pizza and some suspicious-looking substances. There was Beckham's questioning of quarterback Eli Manning. There were antics on the sideline, most notably when Beckham got into a wrestling match with the kicker's practice net.
Beckham jokingly tweeted about all the talk of his reputation on Thursday.
I'm not a Cancer....... I'm a Scorpio 😭😭🤪 sorry for the confusion
Dorsey said that Freddie Kitchens' direct approach will help manage Beckham and the other many strong personalities on the Browns. He recognizes that quarterback Baker Mayfield will be responsible for bringing it all together on the field.
""I think with Baker, he showed last year that he can step up to certain challenges,"" Dorsey said. ""And again, the object of this thing is to surround him with as many good football players as you possibly can.""
Dorsey sees it as a positive that Adam Henry is the Browns' receivers coach. Henry had the same job at LSU when Beckham and Jarvis Landry were teammates. Henry also coached Beckham in New York in 2016. Joining a team with Landry will ""only help"" both players, Dorsey said. ""I know that they are best of friends,"" Dorsey said of Landry and Beckham. ""They've very competitive with each other. I heard Les Miles talks about how those two would drive each other and push each other at LSU to compete. And I think it can only help each other because that competition brings out the best in any athlete, regardless of the sport.""
Dorsey quipped (seriously) that the only excitement he felt the night of the trade was to get home and see his son and daughter before they went to bed. But he is aware that the trade has raised expectations for the Browns, who went through a winless season as recently as 2017.
""Expectations, I hear a lot about that,"" Dorsey said. ""But I know this: Good football teams, they win in the fall. And what we've done is we've added some talent. Now the chemistry part's got to take over with it.""

26253172,"NORMAN, Okla. -- Kyler Murray's rise up draft boards culminated Wednesday with Oklahoma's pro day, during which he threw in front of roughly 75 NFL executives, coaches and scouts.
Through an array of routes to multiple receivers, Murray was crisp, completing 61 of his 67 workout passes, which included one drop.
""Thought it went well,"" Murray said. ""It was fun to finally actually do something.""
Despite doing little at the combine, and virtually nothing other than throwing on Wednesday, Murray's draft stock has rocketed since he won the Heisman Trophy on the way to leading the Sooners to the College Football Playoff last season.
The first day of free agency didn't prevent several notable NFL names from traveling to Norman to watch Murray throw. That included Carolina Panthers general manager Marty Hurney, Cincinnati Bengals coach Zac Taylor, Oakland Raiders offensive coordinator Greg Olson, Los Angeles Chargers offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt and a noticeable contingent from the New York Giants that included senior vice president of player personnel Chris Mara, coach Pat Shurmur and offensive coordinator Mike Shula.
Murray confirmed that he met with the Giants immediately following the pro day. New York will be taking a hard look at quarterback this draft, with Eli Manning being 38 years old and in the final year of his contract. New York owns the No. 6 and No. 17 overall picks after trading wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to the Cleveland Browns, but would likely have to trade up to take Murray.

ESPN Insider Todd McShay has Murray going No. 1 overall to the Arizona Cardinals in his latest mock draft.
""Every kid wants to go No. 1 -- our dream is to go No. 1 draft,"" said Murray, who admitted to getting a text from new Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury ""the other day.""
Concerns going into the draft about Murray's height were largely put to rest at the combine, where he was measured at 5-foot-10⅛ and weighed in at 207 pounds. Murray declined to be measured again Wednesday, but weighed in at 205 pounds.
""I felt amazing leaving the combine, every meeting I had went well,"" he said. ""At least to my face, no one was negative. I had a great experience.""
NFL Network analyst Charley Casserly recently characterized Murray's combine showing in a completely different light, controversially calling Murray's leadership, study habits and board work ""not good.""
In his first interview since those remarks, Murray declined to address Casserly's comments directly, before saying, ""I don't think I would've done what I did [last season] if I didn't understand what defense were doing.""
Murray deferred to his former Oklahoma teammates to discuss his leadership, which offensive lineman Cody Ford did.
""He's one of those leaders that leads by example,"" said Ford, who also projects out as a first-round pick. ""I can recall against Texas he's getting hit a lot. I've never seen a guy get hit that like that and never complain to his O-line. But we knew we needed to get the job done as far as protecting him better, which I feel like we did. But for him not to say a word to us besides, 'Let's get it, let's go' -- no complaining -- showed what kind of leader he is and will be for a long time.""
Despite speculation to the contrary, Murray noted that he's known ""for a while"" that he wasn't going to run the 40-yard dash Wednesday or test any of the agility drills, all of which he also skipped at the combine.
""He's athletically so far beyond anything in this game, and that league either, at that position, there's really honestly not any point,"" Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley said of doing the drills.
Though Riley and others in the program have noted Murray boasts sub-4.4 speed, Murray added he didn't want to risk injury before throwing.
""I'd like to get out there to run, but I don't think it's that necessary for me,"" said Murray, who joined Clemson's Deshaun Watson (2015) as the only FBS quarterback ever to record 4,000 passing and 1,000 rushing yards in the same season. ""I didn't want to pull anything before I got the chance to throw. ... I think the film kinda speaks for itself.""
That is the biggest reason why Murray could give Oklahoma the No. 1 overall pick for the second straight year, following Cleveland quarterback Baker Mayfield, who also won the Heisman with the Sooners.
Mayfield solidified his spot at No. 1 following Oklahoma's pro day last year. Murray is hoping he just did the same.
""It was my job to come here and make throws,"" he said. ""I think I showed everybody I can do that.""

26231060,"Gore is the NFL's oldest running back -- he will be 36 when the 2019 season starts -- but he showed little sign of being done in 2018. He joins a Bills backfield fronted by 30-year-old running back LeSean McCoy.
Cornerback Kevin Johnson, released by the Texans last week, reportedly has agreed to a contract with the Bills.
A five-time Pro Bowl selection, Gore is NFL's active career rushing leader with 14,748 yards for the San Francisco 49ers, Indianapolis Colts and Miami Dolphins. He's No. 4 on the all-time list, trailing only Barry Sanders, Walter Payton and Emmitt Smith, who are all in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Gore needs just 252 rushing yards to reach the 15,000-yard milestone and 522 to pass Sanders to move into third place.
It is initially unclear where Gore fits into an experienced Bills backfield. Buffalo will now have the NFL's three oldest running backs -- Gore, Chris Ivory (30) and McCoy -- under contract for 2019. McCoy and Ivory both enter the final seasons of their contracts with salary-cap numbers of $9.1 million and $2.9 million, respectively.
Bills general manager Brandon Beane reiterated at the end of last season that McCoy was part of the team's plans in 2019, despite the six-time Pro Bowler having posted career lows in rushing yards (514) and yards per rush (3.2) last season. Ivory, whom the Bills signed as a free agent last offseason, rushed 115 times for 385 yards and one touchdown.

In 14 games last season, Gore led Miami with 722 rushing yards and an average of 4.6 yards per carry. He also had 12 receptions for 124 yards and a touchdown. He overtook Kenyan Drake to become the Dolphins' starter, and he quickly became one of the team's leaders.
Gore signed a one-year contract with the Dolphins last March to play in his hometown, where he starred in college at the University of Miami. He said earlier this offseason that he would have loved to finish his career in Miami.
Gore is one of the NFL's iron men. His 2018 season ended on Dec. 16 after he suffered a right foot sprain, which snapped a streak of 126 consecutive games that dated back to 2010.
The injury, which didn't require surgery, also snapped Gore's streak of 12 consecutive seasons with at least 1,000 total yards. But he has made a career of overcoming injuries, including two torn ACLs, two shoulder surgeries, a fractured hip and a broken hand.
In 2016, Gore became the first running back age 33 or older in more than 30 years to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. In 2018, he passed Payton and Smith for the most consecutive seasons (14) with 500-plus rushing yards.

Garcon, 32, was the first free-agent target for 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch when they took over in 2017. Garcon signed a lucrative five-year deal and was expected to offer production and leadership, but injuries limited him to more of the latter than the former.
In each of the past two seasons, Garcon played in just eight games before landing on injured reserve because of neck and knee injuries. He had arthroscopic knee surgery on his knee in December after attempting to play through the injury.
Garcon joined the Niners from the Washington Redskins, where he first played under Shanahan. Garcon began his career as a sixth-round choice of the Indianapolis Colts out of Division III Mount Union in 2008; he has 628 career receptions for 7,854 yards and 38 touchdowns.
The team did tender one-year contracts Thursday to running back Raheem Mostert, a restricted free agent, and to linebacker Elijah Lee and defensive back Greg Mabin, who are exclusive rights free agents. Additionally, the team exercised the 2019 contract options for fullback Kyle Juszczyk, defensive lineman Cassius Marsh, linebacker Dekoda Watson and cornerback K'Waun Williams.

26248791,"The Patriots had acquired McCourty and a 2018 seventh-round draft pick from the Cleveland Browns in exchange for a 2018 sixth-round pick on March 15, 2018. The Browns had been prepared to release McCourty when the Patriots called to inquire about trading for him.
That aggressive approach, which paired McCourty with his twin brother, Devin, on New England's roster, paid off for the team. McCourty played in all 16 regular-season games, with 12 starts. He also played in all three playoff games, making a key play in Super LIII when he broke up a would-be touchdown to Los Angeles Rams receiver Brandin Cooks in the back of the end zone after sprinting a long way to jar the ball free.
McCourty totaled 68 tackles, one interception and 10 passes defended during the regular season. Teammates and coaches cited his leadership on numerous occasions during the season, as playing for the 0-16 Browns in 2017 brought a different type of outlook to the locker room.
""We get in a routine, we've won a lot of football games, and it's always good to get a perspective of what it takes, so you're not kind of getting worn down or thinking, 'We're working hard, this is too much,'"" Devin McCourty said of his brother during the season.
Jason McCourty, who turns 32 in August, had said his first choice would be to return to the Patriots in 2019.
The Patriots also agreed to terms with free-agent running back Brandon Bolden on a two-year deal, a source confirmed to ESPN.
This will be a return to New England for Bolden, who was with the Patriots from 2012 to 2017 before spending the 2018 season in Miami. Bolden is more of a reserve and special-teams player as well as a strong locker-room presence. NFL Network first reported this agreement.
The Patriots are also close to finalizing a deal that would bring back outside linebacker John Simon, a source confirmed to ESPN.
Simon had been a surprise cut by the Indianapolis Colts after the 2018 preseason, following one season of a three-year, $13.5 million deal.
He played an unsung role in New England's Super Bowl season, a year that culminated with him playing 85 defensive snaps over three playoff games -- highlighting, in part, how his role grew as games became more important.
A few weeks ago, Simon told ESPN: ""There's been some talks, and things look promising. ... I enjoyed my time playing for Bill [Belichick]. I think he's a great coach, and I'd definitely love to play for him again.""
NFL Network first reported that an agreement was close.

26135111,"The 2019 NFL draft is a little less than two months away. Teams spent the past week at the NFL scouting combine getting a look at the top talent.
Now they have to decide what to do with their picks. Here's a look at some of the biggest questions they will be answering.
What would it take for the Cardinals to trade the No. 1 overall pick?
A lot. The Cardinals have yet to set a price for the top pick, but they won't move back unless it's just right -- whether or not that offer includes quarterback Josh Rosen. Coming out of the combine, it seems the Cardinals have zeroed in on Ohio State pass-rusher Nick Bosa. But they are doing their due diligence on Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray, which means that if they don't get an offer that blows them away, the Cardinals might be comfortable staying put at No. 1. -- Josh Weinfuss
Would the 49ers rather trade down from the No. 2 spot or add an elite edge rusher?
Montez Sweat and D.K. Metcalf broke records. Zedrick Woods and Andy Isabella ran blazing 40-yard dashes. Here's who's climbing NFL draft boards.
From which team will draft Kyler Murray to Jon Gruden's plans to where Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell could land, here's what we heard this week.
Will the Cardinals dive in for Kyler Murray, or is pass-rusher Nick Bosa still the top pick? Todd McShay goes 1-32 in this year's draft.
Coach Kyle Shanahan has emphasized the need for ""closers"" for a team that has lost 11 one-possession games in the past two seasons, and he likened having a top edge rusher to having a top quarterback. Considering that and the Niners' position with the No. 2 overall pick, San Francisco appears to be better served to stay put and take a real difference-maker on the outside. That's not to say the 49ers wouldn't listen if someone came calling, and free agency could change things. -- Nick Wagoner
The Jets pulled off the biggest trade of the 2018 draft. How likely are they to do it again this year at No. 3?
The motivation is there, no question. General manager Mike Maccagnan would love to pull a reverse of last year, trading down and recouping what he sent to the Colts: three second-round picks. To make it happen, though, he will need a quarterback-needy team as a partner. Did someone say the Giants? The local rivals haven't made a trade since 1983, but they could help each other out by swapping places. With extra picks, the Jets could plug multiple holes, especially on the offensive line. If a trade makes sense, the Jets will do it. -- Rich Cimini
Oakland has three first-round picks. How would you define a successful Day 1 for Jon Gruden & Co.?
Talk about a loaded question, because you cannot fairly judge a class until two or three years after draft day, right? Let's just say Gruden and general manager Mike Mayock have to absolutely nail these picks. And by nail, I mean address specific needs at pass-rusher, at receiver and in the secondary. If one of those elite pass-rushers falls into their lap at No. 4 (paging Nick Bosa, Josh Allen, Quinnen Williams), so be it. But if the Raiders are able to trade back, pick up additional selections and address said needs, that would be a successful Day 1. Just check back in a few years. -- Paul Gutierrez
Let's fix the Bucs' defense with the No. 5 pick. What positions (and prospects) could they eye?
The Buccaneers have needs at every level of the defense, so they can go best available with the pick. Mississippi State defensive end Montez Sweat's experience in both a 3-4 and 4-3 scheme and his speed (4.41 40-yard dash at the combine, with a 1.44 10-yard split) could make for a great pairing with Jason Pierre-Paul. If Kwon Alexander doesn't return, LSU linebacker Devin White would be terrific on the inside next to Lavonte David. Even though they used two draft selections on cornerbacks last year -- Carlton Davis and M.J. Stewart -- the Bucs could use an impact player like LSU's Greedy Williams because Brent Grimes is not likely to return. -- Jenna Laine
Give us a percentage chance the Giants take a quarterback with the No. 6 pick, and is there a QB they like over the others at this point?
72.2 percent. General manager Dave Gettleman said he wants to drop a quarterback on the franchise and then eventually watch him from his retirement digs on Cape Cod. He also noted evidence that you get franchise quarterbacks in the first round, not elsewhere. So it's clear he wants a first-round quarterback as long as there is an option with a high-enough grade. Dwayne Haskins seems to be their favorite after impressing the Giants during their 15-minute meeting at the NFL combine. He has the decision-making, size, arm and what is necessary to be the face of a franchise. -- Jordan Raanan

With the Jags expected to sign quarterback Nick Foles in free agency, what is their biggest draft need?
If they sign Foles, then tight end, receiver or offensive line is a must in the first round at No. 7. They also will sign a veteran backup quarterback because they are expected to move on from Blake Bortles. Teddy Bridgewater, Tyrod Taylor or Josh McCown would all fit the bill. -- Mike DiRocco
The one position the Packers have to address with their two first-round picks is ___________.
Edge rusher. Unless, of course, they can land a big-time pass-rushing free agent. Several agents who met with the Packers at the combine said they got the sense the plan is to spend on a pass-rusher -- or pass-rushers -- in free agency and then see what's left in the budget for other spots. Even if they do land a big-time pass-rusher in free agency, they might be wise to double up at the position with either the No. 12 or No. 30 pick overall. -- Rob Demovsky

Are the Dolphins still eyeing the 2020 draft to address the quarterback position, and what will it take for them to draft one in the first round this year?
Miami isn't in a great position to draft one of the top quarterbacks at No. 13; Kyler Murray, Dwayne Haskins and Drew Lock might all be off the board. Miami would likely need to trade up to get its QB, and Murray might not be available if Arizona picks him first overall. So although Dolphins general manager Chris Grier tried to throw water on the ""tank for Tua"" campaign, it's looking increasingly likely that Miami might have to wait until 2020 to find its franchise QB. -- Cameron Wolfe
Pittsburgh is almost certainly moving wide receiver Antonio Brown this offseason. How likely is the team to draft his replacement early?
There's a strong chance the Steelers select a Day 2 receiver for the third consecutive draft. Pittsburgh needs help in this area, but the free-agency receiver pool is considered weak, and the franchise believes in its ability to evaluate receiver talent. It has a track record of finding impact pass-catchers outside of the first round. The Steelers are banking on James Washington making a Year 2 leap but need more depth behind JuJu Smith-Schuster. Despite obvious needs on defense, plucking a receiver out of the first round, at No. 20, isn't out of the question. -- Jeremy Fowler

26144310,"Bynes, 29, started 11 games for the Cardinals last season before a thumb injury ended his season. He finished with 75 tackles and a career-high two sacks.
The Cardinals will save $1.775 million on their salary cap with the move. He was scheduled to be paid a base salary of $1.5 million in 2019.
Bynes spent his first three seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, who signed him as an undrafted free agent in 2011. He was on the Super Bowl championship team of 2012, and had one tackle in the title game -- on Ted Ginn Jr. after a free kick -- in the final seconds of the game to clinch the Ravens' 34-31 victory over the San Francisco 49ers.
He was signed by the Detroit Lions off the Ravens practice squad on 2014 and played for the Lions for three seasons.
He was signed by the Cardinals to a one-year contract at the league's veteran minimum in 2017, and in March 2018, the Cardinals signed him to a three-year, $5.57 million contract that included $1.25 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $1 million.

26038570,"PITTSBURGH -- Le'Veon Bell will be a free agent.
The Pittsburgh Steelers will not place a franchise or transition tag on the All-Pro running back, general manager Kevin Colbert told local reporters on Wednesday.
""Le'Veon is still a great player,"" Colbert said. ""We can't afford to use any other type of tags. Le'Veon will be an unrestricted free agent at the start of the new league year.""
Bell took to Twitter later Wednesday to rejoice at the news.
Free at last, Free at last, Thank God Almighty I am free at last 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
For losing Bell, the team will receive a 2020 compensatory pick that could be worth as high as a third-round selection. Colbert said the transition tag wasn't viable because of the number ($14.5 million) and the fact that Pro Bowl running back James Conner and rookie Jaylen Samuels were productive without Bell last season.
Bell, who turned 27 on Monday, declined to sign his franchise tender last year, leaving $14.5 million on the table and sitting out the entire season.
Moving on from one is tough; parting with both is a talent drain. Here's a few options for the Steelers to make the best out of a bad situation.
Leading up to Colbert's announcement, the value of a transition tag for Bell and how the Steelers might apply it were up for debate. Though Colbert said Bell's tag would have been $14.5 million, which was the NFLPA's number, the Steelers and the NFL considered arguing the number should be closer to $9.5 million because Bell sat out, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. That point is now moot.
If the Steelers tried to execute a sign-and-trade off the transition tag -- matching another team's offer sheet and then dealing him -- the NFLPA would likely argue the team was breaking the spirit of the tag and the CBA, according to a source.
Colbert also said the Steelers will not offer a discount in a trade to get rid of disgruntled wide receiver Antonio Brown. The GM said no relationship is irreparable, so if the team can't find good value for him, keeping Brown might be an option.
""We're all disappointed we're at this point. How things transpired, we're all disappointed,"" Colbert said. ""Respectfully, we did agree [that looking] into a trade would probably be the best course of action for both sides. .... By no means are we going to make a trade or any type of move that will not be beneficial to the Pittsburgh Steelers organization. We will not be discounting you on the trade market and we will not release you.""
He added that the Steelers have not had any active trade talks about Brown with other teams to this point. Colbert said that Brown's agent Drew Rosenhaus will be involved but ""we will control this.""
Team president Art Rooney II spent 20-to-30 minutes with Brown in South Florida on Tuesday to discuss Brown's situation, Colbert said.
As for what went wrong with Brown, Colbert deferred to Rooney's discussion but pointed out on two different occasions that Brown is a ""highly emotional"" player, which is good ""98 percent"" of the time.
""We know we have a significant player. We know it's probably best to move on,"" Colbert said. ""But we'll also know we'll only do that if it benefits us.""

26223048,"Happy legal tampering day!
As of Monday, NFL teams are legally allowed to start talking with the agents for prospective free-agent players -- that is, players whose contracts expire at 4 p.m. ET Wednesday when the new league year begins.
The next couple of days are where the first wave of free agency really happens, and by 4 p.m. ET Wednesday, we'll likely have a sense of where most of the big names are headed.

So, before it all gets started, I felt I'd share with you a little bit of what I'm hearing about how the week might play out:
Jump to:
Under-the-radar positions | Trade rumblings
Thrifty playoff teams | Don't be surprised if ...
Quick hitters | What about the QBs?

Sources familiar with the Raiders' thinking say they would like to use their salary-cap space on offensive players and find defensive solutions in a defense-heavy draft in which they hold four of the top 35 picks. Bell's market has been a bit tough to figure out. I've heard the Jets, Ravens and Texans listed as interested teams, but no one seems to know who's going to pay Bell $12-13 million a year or more. Jon Gruden and the Vegas-bound Raiders obviously aren't afraid to be aggressive.
Maybe one like the four-year, $30 million deal Jerick McKinnon got from the 49ers last year. There are teams looking for running backs who are telling people they're more interested in Coleman at his price than Bell at his. Look out for the Jets, Ravens and Texans if they don't get Le'Veon, and don't completely rule out the 49ers, who don't owe McKinnon another guaranteed penny.
The wide receiver market is a bit thin (except for one specific part of it we'll get to later), and there's a list of teams interested in finding out what the 6-foot-4 Williams would look like as their No. 1 wideout. Teams looking for receivers include the Colts, Jets, Browns and Bills, who happen to be the top four teams in terms of projected available cap space, as well as the Titans, 49ers, Cardinals, Lions, Eagles and Patriots. Williams is going to have a huge market.

The Chargers' release of Jahleel Addae caught my attention, as I'd been told to watch out for them as a surprise potential Thomas destination. They had some interest in Eric Weddle before he signed with the Rams, and while Thomas will cost a lot more than Weddle did, the Chargers could view him as the player who puts their stacked roster over the top. Of course, the Chiefs, who edged out the Chargers for the AFC West title in 2018, have a need at the position as well and were among the teams interested in trading for Thomas last fall.

The safety market is flooded, but Thomas is in a class by himself and could become the league's highest-paid player at the position this week.
Tyrell Williams, as we mentioned earlier, should benefit from the dearth of outside receivers in this market. But I'm hearing numbers in the $9-10 million-a-year range for slot guys like Adam Humphries, Jamison Crowder and Cole Beasley, all of whom could move on from their former teams for big deals elsewhere.
What could Earl Thomas' new contract look like? We projected free-agent deals, based on conversations with people in the league.
Vontaze Burfict is headed to Oakland as a veteran stopgap. Did the Raiders actually improve? Bill Barnwell evaluates the biggest deals.
The NFL free-agency period is here. We rank the top 100 players to hit the open market, from Le'Veon Bell to depth defenders.
C.J. Mosley and Anthony Barr are big names whose teams didn't franchise them because the linebacker franchise number ($15.443 million) was too big. The number is inflated because pass-rushing 3-4 outside linebackers are lumped together with linebackers like Mosley and Barr, who don't rush the passer. Neither Mosley nor Barr can expect to make $15 million per year on a new deal, but it's not crazy to think they could each get Luke Kuechly-level $12 million-a-year deals if enough teams are interested.
The Rams will look different on the offensive line, where center John Sullivan is a free agent and so is left guard Rodger Saffold. The latter is almost surely gone from L.A. and is the top guard on a relatively thin market. Two veteran guards -- Kevin Zeitler and Kelechi Osemele -- have been traded in the past few days. More teams are looking.
Not sure if you noticed, but the Patriots didn't franchise anyone, including kicker Stephen Gostkowski. Many expect them to re-sign him, but would another team (Bears?) swoop in and give Gostkowski a top-of-the-market deal based on his career accomplishments? And if so, do we have to wonder what the Patriots know? They've had only two different kickers since 1996. If they're making a change at the position, there must be a good reason.
It's reportedly for $13 million per year (though we haven't seen the full details yet, possibly because the Eagles are waiting until the new league year to officially execute it for accounting purposes), and several teams at the combine were disappointed with the Eagles for paying that high a price for a soon-to-be-31-year-old pass-rusher. The deal allowed the Eagles to trade Michael Bennett to the Patriots, and it likely drives up the price for free-agent pass-rushers such as Za'Darius Smith. Graham has the same agent as Justin Houston, a similar-age pass-rusher who was cut by the Chiefs on Sunday and is free to sign with any team immediately.

Again, we have yet to see the full details, but ESPN's Adam Schefter is reporting Brown will earn $19.8 million per year in new money on the contract the Raiders will give him once his trade from Pittsburgh to Oakland becomes official. Obviously, Tyrell Williams can't hope for a number like that, but it doesn't make life easier for the Falcons, Saints and Chiefs, who are working on extensions for Julio Jones, Michael Thomas and Tyreek Hill, respectively. The first $20 million-a-year wide receiver contract could arrive this summer.
The Cowboys are so focused on extensions for Dak Prescott, DeMarcus Lawrence, Amari Cooper, Byron Jones and (eventually) Ezekiel Elliott that they aren't expected to be major players in free agency. Some people have connected them with Earl Thomas for a long time, but his price is likely going to be too high for the Cowboys, who might wait out this deep safety market and find a bargain.

If the Bears lose safety Adrian Amos and slot corner Bryce Callahan, they'll have to fill those spots. But Chicago's big offseason was last year, and the Bears like the roster they have. Watch out to see what they do at running back, where Jordan Howard could be cut and Adrian Peterson could be a free-agent target to replace him.
Like the Cowboys, Seattle is focused internally. Starting guards J.R. Sweezy and D.J. Fluker are both free agents, and if they leave the Hawks will have to find some other guys with initials instead of first names to play guard. Linebacker K.J. Wright (what's with the initials?) is another free agent they'd like to keep, and they are preparing for extension talks with defensive end Frank Clark, linebacker Bobby Wagner, defensive tackle Jarran Reed and the big one: quarterback Russell Wilson.
Multiple sources expect former Patriots defensive end Trey Flowers to get a monster deal (maybe in excess of $18 million per year) on the open market after many of the top free-agent pass-rushers got franchised. Two of Flowers' former New England defensive coordinators are now head coaches: Brian Flores in Miami and Matt Patricia in Detroit. Watch Flowers for the Lions, who are expected to be among the most aggressive players on this market.
Landon Collins was a first-team All-Pro safety in 2016 when he was with the Giants and Steve Spagnuolo was his defensive coordinator. Spagnuolo is now the defensive coordinator in Kansas City. Collins might not be a perfect fit for the Chiefs, whose top choice would be a free safety. And a team like the Colts, who already have Malik Hooker for the back end, might make more sense for Collins. But if anyone knows how Collins can help a defense, it's Spagnuolo.
Giants fans might want the team to reunite safety Tyrann Mathieu with former Arizona defensive coordinator James Bettcher in East Rutherford, New Jersey, but the more likely former-Cardinal Giants target is free-agent linebacker Deone Bucannon.

At last check, the Giants still had no active trade talks involving their star wide receiver. And I still seriously doubt ownership signs off on a trade that would leave the Giants with $16 million in dead money on their cap and having paid Beckham $21.5 million in cash for 12 games. But there are teams (specifically the 49ers and Browns) still hoping to talk the Giants out of Beckham, and there are still people around the league who believe such a move isn't impossible for the right (exorbitant) price. This isn't an Antonio Brown situation, where the team feels it has to dump a guy for whatever it can get.

It's hard to imagine the Buccaneers' defense without McCoy, but the Bucs really could use the $13 million in cap savings they'd get by trading him. Watch Tampa Bay's other moves in the coming days (cut or trade DeSean Jackson, for example?) and see whether they end up needing the cap room and getting what they need to get in exchange for a well-liked star.
Houston has been trying to re-sign Tyrann Mathieu, but so far it hasn't tried hard enough. He still could end up back there, but more than one source has told me to watch out for Baltimore.
Nick Foles is still expected to sign a multiyear deal with the Jaguars, but there's some tough negotiating still to do. Jacksonville is more or less the only place Foles can go and start, and Foles is the top quarterback option for the Jags. It would be a shock if this didn't get done, but since neither side has much leverage, there could still be a hiccup or two before the final details are nailed down.
Even coming off a November ACL tear, 25-year-old cornerback Ronald Darby is of interest to several teams. Don't be surprised if he gets a big deal.
The Saints are still hoping to bring back running back Mark Ingram, but not for much (if any) more than the $4 million or so per year he was making with them on his most recent deal. He'll check out the market, but he's got it pretty good in New Orleans.

Unless the Nick Foles deal totally collapses in Jacksonville or Miami signs him to be a starter, Bridgewater's best play might end up being a return to New Orleans for another season as Drew Brees' backup.
Expected to be cut by the Dolphins, Tannehill could surface as Sam Darnold's backup with the Jets, where new coach Adam Gase has always been a fan.
The obvious fits are Baltimore and Carolina, where the starters are mobile, and the offenses are somewhat designed around that, which is one of Taylor's strengths.

Wright said that he will receive a two-year deal for up to $15 million.
Wright, who will turn 30 in July, appeared in only five regular-season games for the Seahawks in 2018 because of a knee injury that required arthroscopic surgery in late August. It kept him out for the first six games, and then he suffered a setback in his return and was sidelined for five more.
Wright finished strong with seven tackles in Week 17 and then eight tackles and a late interception in the Seahawks' wild-card loss to the Dallas Cowboys.

Wright and All-Pro Bobby Wagner formed one of the NFL's best linebacker tandems during their seven seasons together. A fourth-round pick (99th overall) out of Mississippi State in 2011, Wright topped 100 tackles every year from 2014 to 2017, and his 717 tackles rank seventh in franchise history.
He made his first and only Pro Bowl after the 2016 season, when he set career highs in tackles (126) and sacks (four).
Wright, who just finished out a four-year, $27 million extension signed in December 2014, said he took out an insurance policy to mitigate the risk of not being signed beyond 2018. On more than one occasion, he talked about embracing the opportunity to become a free agent, even if his preference would be to remain in Seattle.
On Wednesday, the Seahawks brought back Mychal Kendricks on a one-year deal. Kendricks and Wright both play the weak-side spot primarily, so it's not clear how the Seahawks plan to configure their linebackers on either side of Wagner. Kendricks' situation is also unclear as he's scheduled to be sentenced on April 4 for insider trading charges.
Bringing back Wright and Kendricks raises the uncertainty about Barkevious Mingo's future with the team. He's under contract for another season with a cap number of $5.2 million, which includes a non-guaranteed base salary of $3.4 million. Seattle would clear $4.1 million in cap space while incurring a $1.1-million dead-money charge by releasing Mingo.
This offseason, the Seahawks also agreed to a deal with Pro Bowl kicker Jason Myers and lost safety Earl Thomas.

26243380,"Former Pittsburgh Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell plans to sign a four-year, $52.5 million contract with the New York Jets, a league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The deal includes $35 million guaranteed, with a maximum value of close to $61 million, including incentives, a source said.
Bell, who has been training in South Florida, confirmed he would be joining the Jets in an Instagram post late Tuesday night:
 lets goooo!!!! ✈️✈️✈️ ""Life's A Gamble"" OUT ON ALL PLATFORMS
A post shared by  LeVeon Bell (@leveonbell) on Mar 12, 2019 at 9:48pm PDT
Bell, who shocked the NFL by sitting out the entire 2018 season on the franchise tag after failing to agree on a new contract, officially became a free agent when Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert opted not to place a franchise or transition tag on Bell for the 2019 season.
After gaining nearly 2,000 total yards during the 2017 season, Bell opted to eschew the $14.5 million franchise tag in 2018 -- forgoing about $855,000 per game -- so he could preserve his long-term viability for a big contract in free agency this offseason.
Several other teams were said to be interested in Bell, including the San Francisco 49ers, who made a strong offer and were engaged in a wild tug-of-war with the Jets over the final few hours, sources told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.
But the Jets emerged as the front-runners late Tuesday. Not wanting to bid against themselves, they held firm on their offer, a source told ESPN's Rich Cimini.
Bell, a two-time All-Pro, had used social media to engage with potential suitors, using emojis to make indirect contact with the Indianapolis Colts and Baltimore Ravens, among others. The Ravens never made him an offer, a source told Schefter.
Bell's average salary per year with the Jets, $13.13 million, would rank second among running backs in the NFL, behind Todd Gurley's $14.37 million average.
The Jets expect Bell to instantly upgrade an offense that finished 29th in total yards and 26th in rushing yards. They also believe he will be the ideal backfield mate for quarterback Sam Darnold because of his dual-threat ability.
Le'Veon Bell didn't end up resetting the RB market or landing much more than the Steelers offered. It seems all he wanted was out of Pittsburgh.
Sure, the 27-year-old veteran running back brings some baggage to New York, but he's also a gamble worth taking for a team desperately seeking wins.
The Jets, who were spurned earlier Tuesday by Anthony Barr, reached agreement with DE Henry Anderson on a three-year deal worth $25.2 million, a source confirmed to ESPN.
In finishing 4-12 last season, which resulted in coach Todd Bowles' ouster, the Jets produced only two 100-yard rushing performances, both by Isaiah Crowell. Crowell set the franchise single-game record with 219 yards in an October home game against the Denver Broncos but wasn't much of a factor for the remainder of the season.
Crowell is likely to be released before Friday, when $2 million of his $4 million base salary becomes guaranteed. The backfield will consist of Bell, Elijah McGuire and Trenton Cannon.
The Jets haven't had a 1,000-yard rusher since Chris Ivory in 2015. They haven't had a runner with Bell's skill set since Curtis Martin, a big free-agent signing, from 1998 to 2005. Bell has said that Martin, a Pro Football Hall of Famer, was his idol as a kid.
This has been a busy free-agency period for the Jets, who have reached agreements to add four players on offense: Bell; wide receivers Jamison Crowder and Josh Bellamy; and guard Kelechi Osemele (via trade). On defense, they finalized a deal with Pro Bowl linebacker C.J. Mosley.
Bell's average of 128.9 total yards per game from 2013 to 2017 is the highest for an NFL back over the first five seasons of a career since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970. During that span, he rushed for 5,336 yards and 35 touchdowns and caught 312 passes for 2,660 yards and another seven scores.
Rocky franchise-tag negotiations over the past two years created distance between Bell and the Steelers. He missed training camp in 2017 when the sides couldn't agree on a contract, and he eventually played on a $12.12 million franchise tag -- rushing for 1,291 yards and nine touchdowns, while catching 85 passes for 655 yards and two more TDs.
After the 2017 season, Bell showed his conviction by turning down a five-year, $70 million offer because of what he called a low true guarantee of $17 million, and he was able to miss games because he was unsigned and thus not bound to the team.
The Steelers, who found success in the backfield last season with Pro Bowl selection James Conner and backup Jaylen Samuels, will receive a 2020 compensatory pick for losing Bell that could be worth as high as a third-round selection.

By sitting out the 2018 season, Bell, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, correctly bet the Steelers wouldn't place a third consecutive franchise tag on him.
Players were surprised when Bell didn't show for Week 1, and his own offensive line ripped him for the absence. Guard Ramon Foster and center Maurkice Pouncey both labeled the move selfish. One veteran player told ESPN anonymously: ""He f---ed us."" After tensions cooled, many players said they would welcome Bell back.
At one point last season, Bell, who turned 27 in February, planned to play for the Steelers. He told ESPN on Oct. 1, ""I'll be fully committed and give you everything I have"" upon returning, to ""go out there and win a Super Bowl with the Steelers.""
But the Steelers explored dealing Bell before the Oct. 30 trade deadline, which might have affected his plans. No trade was possible without Bell's signature.
Throughout this offseason, the Steelers seemed focused more on value than a hope Bell would play in Pittsburgh again. When asked in November what would happen if Bell never returns to the Steelers, coach Mike Tomlin said simply, ""So be it.""
The Jets host the Steelers next season, as well as former Pittsburgh star wideout Antonio Brown and the Oakland Raiders.
ESPN's Rich Cimini and Jeremy Fowler contributed to this report.
"
26149941,"Teams that have spoken to the Pittsburgh Steelers about a potential Antonio Brown trade have been told that a deal is expected to be in place by Friday, league sources tell ESPN.
Any trade that is agreed upon can't be officially announced until next Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET, when the 2019 league year begins. It is likely Brown will want a restructured contract from any team that acquires him. Brown has three years remaining on his deal, with scheduled base salaries of $12.625 million in 2019, $11.3 million in 2020 and $12.5 million in 2021, but he has no guaranteed money remaining on the contract.
What are the pros and cons of adding the talented wide receiver? Which is the best landing spot? Our NFL Nation reporters weigh in.
Although other teams could emerge, the belief right now is that the Raiders, Redskins and Titans are the most likely landing spots for receiver Antonio Brown, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Steelers WR Antonio Brown said he believes he will be dealt by the team because that's ""what's good for their business,"" but he does not ""take any blame"" for the breakdown of his relationship with the franchise.
As of last Friday, the three teams that have shown the most interest in the wide receiver were the Oakland Raiders, Washington Redskins and Tennessee Titans. In addition, a couple more teams have jumped into the fray in the past 24 to 48 hours, sources said, putting the total number of teams to which the Steelers have spoken in the past few days at six or seven.
The Steelers' asking price started as a first-round pick and other compensation but has been reduced to a first-round pick, sources have told ESPN.
Brown has officially been on the trading block since he met with Steelers brass last month.
In an interview with ESPN last week, the star wide receiver said he is not ""angry"" with the team but maintained his desire to be traded.
Antonio Brown discusses his issues with Ben Roethlisberger, Mike Tomlin and Art Rooney II that led to his trade request from the Steelers.
Speaking at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis last week, Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert said the team hasn't ruled out any partners in a potential trade.
""Ideally, you want to trade him to somebody that you'll never play,"" Colbert said. ""But you can't do that. If you're good enough to get to the Super Bowl, you have to play him anyway.""
Brown, who turns 31 in July, owns an NFL-record six consecutive 100-catch seasons, but he frustrated the organization when he failed to show up for a workday in Week 17 and was benched for the season finale.
"
26271903,"Swaim entered the 2018 season with nine catches for 94 yards in his first three years but finished last season with 26 catches for 242 yards and a touchdown, becoming a starter for the Dallas Cowboys after the retirements of Jason Witten and James Hanna.
Injuries, however, have hampered his development. He played in only nine games last season mostly because of a broken wrist that required surgery. In 2016, he suffered a pectoral tear that limited him to nine games.
Swaim, 25, is a solid blocker and pass-catcher. He had a career-high five catches in Week 3 against Seattle and 55 yards two weeks later against Houston.
Swaim is now the Jaguars' most accomplished tight end. Ben Koyack has 24 catches for 199 yards and one touchdown in 37 career games with the Jaguars, though he did catch a fourth-down touchdown pass to help the Jaguars beat Buffalo 10-3 in an AFC wild-card game after the 2017 season. The only other tight end on the roster is Pharoah McKever, who signed with Pittsburgh as an undrafted rookie in 2018 and spent time on the practice squads in Cleveland and Jacksonville.
The Jaguars declined to pick up the 2019 option on Austin Seferian-Jenkins, whom they signed to a two-year, $10 million contract with $4 million guaranteed last March. Seferian-Jenkins caught 11 passes for 90 yards and a touchdown in five games last season before going on injured reserve with a groin injury.

26097648,"Harry, a gifted wide receiver out of Arizona State coming off back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons, is trying to secure a spot in the first round of the draft with a solid performance at the NFL combine in Indianapolis. His first-round status is uncertain, and on Saturday, the receivers get their turn to impress scouts.
Harry's football skill and agility aren't in question. His speed, however, is, and his time in Saturday's 40-yard dash has loomed over him this week.

Herm Edwards, his coach during his final season with the Sun Devils, says Harry has all the components to be a successful pro.
""Is he willing to compete?"" Edwards asked. ""Check that box. Does he prepare himself when he is not in the building, when he's off the field? Check that box. In the community, does he have any issues in the community? Does he have any red flags of him being obviously social problems and outside the community? Has he been arrested? Check that box off, nope. There's a lot of boxes he checks off. Probably the biggest box of all that he checks off, and I've discussed it with the pro guys, is he loves to compete.""
How Harry competes at the combine will heavily dictate his draft placement. He's currently projected to go anywhere from the middle of the first round to somewhere in the second. ESPN NFL Insider Todd McShay said Harry has ""late-first-, early-second-type value,"" but will likely go in the first round because the league is trending toward ""playmakers, difference-makers and finding matchup pieces."" It'll help Harry that this year's draft is short on top-level receivers.
But where he's drafted doesn't matter for just his ego. It'll affect his contract. Being a first-round pick means more guaranteed money and the possibility for a fifth-year option on his rookie deal. It could also impact Harry's second contract. And that affects his ability to take care of his granny, who has been taking care of him nearly his entire life.
About 18 years ago, Felna retired from the government's ministry of health on the small Caribbean island of St. Vincent and started to travel the world.
But then her life changed in a way she never saw coming. She needed to become a mother again, only this time it was to her grandson. Felna, who has four children of her own, has been caring for N'Keal full time since he was almost 4 years old.
""My first check, that's for her. That's for her,"" N'Keal said. ""That's my thank-you to her. So, whatever she asks for, it'll be given.
""She's been waiting on this day for so long to stop working, to kick her feet back and relax. She really does deserve that. She's been working so hard all these years. She was retired back home and she literally started all over again. It takes a tremendous amount of heart to do that.""
N'Keal was born on Dec. 17, 1997, to his mom, Naudine, who had followed the path of many Vincentians, moving to Canada to find a better life. While pregnant, Naudine found Toronto's weather to be vastly different from St. Vincent's and began plotting her return to the island. But first, she waited to have N'Keal.
When Naudine and N'Keal returned to St. Vincent, Felna was waiting for her 1-month-old grandson. From there, an unbreakable bond formed.
About three years later, after taking early retirement, Felna wanted to see the world. But by then, Felna had begun caring for N'Keal like he was a son. She couldn't bear to leave him, and knew America would provide him with better opportunities. She and Naudine sat down to discuss Felna taking N'Keal to the States when the time was right. Naudine, understandably, hesitated. She was torn. Her emotions were mixed.
""There are a lot of opportunities there [in the United States],"" Naudine said. ""At a very early age, we saw something really special in N'Keal, especially when it came to sports. ... So we decided that [Felna] would take him with her. It wasn't easy. It wasn't an easy decision. But it turned out for the best because he could not have accomplished that here. He could not have.""
So when N'Keal was almost 4, he and his granny moved to Arizona.
""When I was leaving home, I had friends who told me not to do it,"" Felna said. ""They said, 'It's going to be too hard. You're going to a strange place to start over. You cannot have a child with you.' I thought of it and I see it made sense, but the love for that child blinded me. I just, see, I got to look after him. His chances out here are better.
""Of course, there are times I wondered, 'What did I get myself into?'""
Starting over was difficult. They needed an apartment, they needed to find daycare and they needed to find sports for N'Keal to stay busy.
Soon, he got involved in basketball, track and field, baseball, martial arts, soccer, swimming and, later, football.
As a 6-year-old, he was playing up in soccer against 8-year-olds -- and scoring against them. In basketball, he was better than everyone on the court, and the other parents noticed, complaining to the coaches. He was eventually told not to shoot and to pass instead. Felna said he was given the nickname ""Another LeBron James.""
To pay for it all -- and cover the rent -- Felna worked a lot, sometimes two jobs, day and night. There were times N'Keal wouldn't see her for three or four days at a time because she'd have only hours between jobs to rest.
The more sports he played, the busier N'Keal became. That meant Felna had to figure out the logistics of their life. Even though one of his aunts, Janine, had come to live with them in Arizona, she didn't drive, so it was up to Felna to get N'Keal to where he had to go. She had decided to work nights in order to be home with N'Keal. But working from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. was taking its toll.
Being able to work a full shift and then make all his games was getting tougher by the day.
""I'm sitting there half asleep because I worked through the night,"" she said.
While it might have seemed N'Keal was living the all-American childhood, there were voids in his life that pained him.
His mother, Naudine, still lived in St. Vincent. His father wasn't in his life at all. Though coaches and friends' fathers tried fill in for N'Keal's lack of a male role model, they were impermanent fixes.
""It was extremely hard,"" N'Keal said. ""Just because a lot of my friends had their mom and dad. I would be at their house and I would wonder, why didn't I have a mom and dad?""
Some close to him thought he was quiet growing up because of his laid-back island heritage, but it was more because he didn't trust many people.
""It was very hard for me to open up, especially toward males,"" he said. ""I just had to figure everything out by myself, really. Stuff that a father should be there teaching his kid, I didn't get that. I just had to figure it out on my own.""

N'Keal said his mom ""did her absolute best to stay in touch"" with him. The two talk ""pretty often,"" and she also stays in contact with Felna, who talks to her children in St. Vincent regularly.
""It was extremely difficult at times because I don't play a role in his upbringing, and it's tough because he's making all those memories, and I'm missing on his upbringing,"" Naudine said. ""It's difficult. But you know what makes it so much easier? The type of woman my mother is.""
N'Keal has been back twice since he moved as a boy. The most recent time was two Christmases ago. Naudine says she's visited Arizona four or five times since her family moved there.
""I knew the love from my mom was there, always,"" he said. ""She would always make sure I knew she loved me and that she was always thinking about me. To this day, my mom calls me a lot just to see how I'm doing. That meant a lot to me growing up and that still means a lot to me now.""
N'Keal didn't grow up with his parents, but he doesn't blame them.
""Obviously, people always aren't in an ideal situation and I feel like that was what it was like for my parents,"" he said. ""They weren't in an ideal situation for a child. I forgive them for that. People struggle. People go through things. As I got older, as I started to mature, I just started to understand things a lot more clearly. There was no need to hold onto the pain and the anger in that way.""
Through it all, though, he had one stabilizing force in his life: his granny.
Raising a child again, at her age -- as a grandmother -- wasn't easy for Felna. Raising a teenager was even harder.
""That's like the terrible twos,"" she joked.
N'Keal didn't like to wake up in the morning, which led to Felna having to sign him in at school and excuse his tardiness. There were times when Felna would pour water on him to get him out of bed.
""I would hate to see anybody make her mad,"" said T.J. Howard, N'Keal's AAU basketball coach.
When she had to, she was an authoritarian, ruling their townhouse with an iron fist but making sure their home was full of the island love -- and food -- on which she grew up.
And it worked.
""He would've lost his way,"" Felna said.
It was hard for N'Keal to separate from his granny when it came time to pick a college. After every recruiting trip they went on, he'd ask her to move with him. Every time, she'd have to tell him no. When they were walking through the airport back in Phoenix after his trip to Texas A&M, he put his arm around her, told her he liked the school and asked her to come with him.
She'd visit, she'd said, but she couldn't move. She recalled telling him: ""You have to do this on your own. Do what you want to do. It's not for me. It is not for me now. I take you this far. You can take it from here on.""
Then they visited Arizona State, about a 20-minute ride from home, and N'Keal knew it felt right. Felna asked why he wanted to go to Arizona State, but the answer was obvious.
""Because you are here,"" he told her.
He committed to the Sun Devils and his granny never missed a home game.
Harry, who according to Howard was talented enough to try his hand at the NBA one day, was recruited by anybody and everybody for football. Shaun Aguano, who coached Harry at Chandler High School and is now the Arizona State running-backs coach, said schools were taken with N'Keal's combination of size and athleticism.
He's a freak of a receiver, standing 6-foot-2, weighing around 228 pounds, with feet like a ballerina's and hands like those of Larry Fitzgerald. N'Keal will go across the middle, work the sideline, outmuscle a cornerback or outjump a safety for a catch. He can make all the catches -- in traffic, in the flat, against coverage, in a zone, on a fade in the end zone. He's pretty much mastered the one-handed catch, which he displayed against USC last season.
""I don't like comparing players,"" Edwards said. ""I think they make their own lot in life as a player but I've said this: Guys you can probably equate him to -- Dez Bryant. Big, strong, physical guy. Can make the contested catch. ... That's who he reminds me of a lot. Strong hands. Loves to compete. Really good in the red zone. Good coming inside where he's going to take a hit.""
N'Keal caught 73 passes for 1,088 yards and had nine touchdowns during his final season for the Sun Devils, putting him third in school history with 213 career receptions and 2,889 career receiving yards.
The Arizona State receiver tells the story of a nerve-wracking 4.5 seconds at the combine that he hopes will push him into the NFL draft's first round.
Here's what you need to know about the NFL's annual combine featuring the top 2019 draft prospects.
In his 31 years of coaching, former Arizona State coach Todd Graham hasn't seen another player who was recruited more heavily or rated higher than N'Keal match his work ethic. N'Keal didn't jog in workouts, Graham remembered. He wasn't a middle-of-the-pack runner. He sprinted. He wanted to finish first. He didn't take plays off during practice.
When they'd talk privately, which happened often in the two seasons they were together at ASU, Graham would ask N'Keal what he wanted out of football. N'Keal's answer never changed: He wanted to be the best.
""This guy, in my opinion, ain't even close to as good as he's going to be,"" Graham said. ""He was in college for 36 months. You're talking about a guy who was really young, as far as his mental maturity, emotional maturity, he was very young coming out of high school.
""He's come leaps and bounds.""
There's one area, though, in which N'Keal believes he needs to prove himself in Indianapolis on Saturday.
""I feel like I have to prove my speed,"" he said. ""I know I'm a lot faster than what people think. I'm just looking to shock everybody, to shock the world. There are a lot of things being said. I'm just excited to make people eat their words.""
To do that, N'Keal said he'll have to put up a 40 time that surpasses everyone's expectations -- 4.5 seconds or faster. He wants to silence his doubters, but he also wants to show the people who have been with him along the way that they were right to believe in him. Especially his granny, who might or might not follow him to his new city.
""What I'm sure of, if he's drafted in somewhere cold, I'm not going,"" she said. ""That much I know. I will stay here and I will go to his games. I will visit him in summer. I'm not going to live in any cold place. The rest, play it by ear.""
N'Keal is ready for the NFL and ready to be on his own. He's free of the emotional restraints that followed him for years. He's accepted his family situation. He's done with school -- for now, at least, although he's promised his granny he'll finish his degree.
He's a firm believer that everything happens for a reason, and for him, it did.
""I really do believe that it was for the best for my grandma raising me,"" he said. ""That woman taught me so much, everything from having very good manners to how to speak to people, how to speak well, how to speak fluently. I'm just thankful.""

26120238,"With Antonio Brown and the Pittsburgh Steelers almost certainly headed for divorce, the star wide receiver faces a future without quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. However, one future Hall of Famer cautioned Brown that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.
""I love AB. Mr. Big Chest is a good friend of mine, but I don't think he's going about it the right way, personally,"" Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald said Saturday while speaking at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. ""To be able to play with an all-time quarterback like he's able to play with, I don't think he understands how good he has it. It can get tough out there.""
What are the pros and cons of adding the talented wide receiver? Which is the best landing spot? Our NFL Nation reporters weigh in.
Steelers WR Antonio Brown said he believes he will be dealt by the team because that's ""what's good for their business,"" but he does not ""take any blame"" for the breakdown of his relationship with the franchise.
Although other teams could emerge, the belief right now is that the Raiders, Redskins and Titans are the most likely landing spots for receiver Antonio Brown, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Fitzgerald, the league's active leader in receiving yards (16,279) and touchdowns (116), knows not all quarterbacks are created equal. He is entering the 16th year of a career that has been spent entirely with the Cardinals, where he has caught at least one pass from 19 different QBs.
Conversely, Brown has spent all nine of his seasons with the Steelers and Roethlisberger but expects passes in season No. 10 to come from someone not wearing a No. 7 Steelers jersey.
""I would've liked for me and Ben to be cool. You know what I mean? I thought we was cool. But when I think ... I've been to his house one time. He's been to my house one time. You know what I mean?"" Brown told ESPN's Jeff Darlington of his relationship with Roethlisberger. ""We don't work out in the offseason. You think that's winning? That's not winning.''
In addition to his relationship with Roethlisberger, Brown also talked about situations with coach Mike Tomlin and ownership that contributed to his desire to get out of Pittsburgh.
""Why wouldn't they not trade me? They gotta pay me $2.5 million on March 17,"" Brown told Darlington. ""If I invoice you March 17, $2.5 million that you gotta pay me, would you pay it or would you get somebody else to pay it? So it's what -- pretty much what's good for their business.""
Brown is owed a $2.5 million roster bonus if he is not traded or released by the Steelers before March 17.
The three teams that have shown the most interest in Brown to date are the Oakland Raiders, Washington Redskins and Tennessee Titans, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Of those three teams, only the Raiders had one quarterback start every game last season.

26026507,"Williams was set to make $3.5 million in 2019 as part of the four-year, $17 million deal he signed in 2017. By declining the option, the Cowboys will save $2.25 million in cap space.
Williams had a forgettable 2018, catching just two passes for 18 yards in three games before being inactive for a game and ultimately placed on injured reserve for the season with a foot injury. He suffered a broken foot last winter, was held out of most of the offseason program and was limited for a time during training camp, and never appeared 100 percent. He also served a three-game suspension for violating the NFL's substance-abuse policy, stemming from an offseason arrest.
He also never found a role as the Cowboys opted to go more with free-agent pickups Allen Hurns and Deonte Thompson, as well as rookie Michael Gallup,  as the outside receivers in the first month of the season. Prior to 2018, Williams had played in all 80 games in his first five seasons and had 230 receptions for 3,359 yards and 20 touchdowns, including the final touchdown pass of Tony Romo's career in 2016.
With the trade for Amari Cooper, the development of Gallup, the role of Noah Brown, as well as the possibility of re-signing Cole Beasley or Tavon Austin, the Cowboys did not have room for Williams. Wide receiver could be among the Cowboys' draft needs as well.
By not picking up the option, the Cowboys can potentially recoup a compensatory pick in 2020.
In other developments, a source told ESPN that the Cowboys have no plans to re-sign defensive lineman David Irving, who played in just two games last season after opening the year on a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy.

26260622,"Antonio Brown said the opportunity to play for Raiders coach Jon Gruden was a factor in his decision to work out a trade to Oakland. Brown said he aims to hold his teammates to a high standard and a personal goal is to pass Jerry Rice's receptions record.
The team announced the contract on Thursday.
Moncrief signed a one-year contract worth a guaranteed $9.6 million with the Jaguars last March. In 16 games, he caught 48 passes for 668 yards, which were his highest totals since he caught 64 passes for 733 yards in his second season in 2015 -- the last time he played in all 16 games.
Moncrief spent his first four seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, who drafted him in the third round (90th overall) in 2014. Moncrief caught 152 passes for 1,875 yards and 18 touchdowns with the Colts. However, he missed seven games in 2016 and four games in 2017 because of injuries and struggled to make much of an impact despite playing opposite T.Y. Hilton.
The Colts did not offer him a second contract, and the Jaguars signed him as a replacement for Allen Robinson, after Robinson opted to sign with the Chicago Bears last year.

26057374,"Parkey missed three extra point attempts and eight field goal tries -- including a 43-yarder that would have beaten the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round of the playoffs -- in his first season with the Bears.
Chicago-based Goose Island Brewery invited fans to attempt a 43-yard field goal on Saturday after Bears kicker Cody Parkey's miss last week. Out of 101 entrants, no one was successful.
Bears coach Matt Nagy was not happy with kicker Cody Parkey going on TV to talk about his missed field goal.
The ""double-doink"" kick, after being slightly tipped, bounced off the left upright and hit the crossbar against Philly. Bears coach Matt Nagy then expressed disapproval with Parkey's decision to appear as a guest on ""Today"" five days later.
Parkey also bounced four kicks off the uprights during a Week 10 victory over the Detroit Lions, which helped give him the third-lowest field goal conversion rate in the NFL.
The Bears signed Parkey, 27, to a four-year deal that included $9 million in guaranteed money in March. The team will have to carry $4,437,500 worth of dead salary-cap money once Parkey is cut when the new league year begins.
NFL Network was first to report Parkey's release.

26179114,"Suspended Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle David Irving said Thursday that he is quitting the NFL.
Irving, 25, made the announcement as he filmed himself in a video on Instagram Live, less than a week after the league suspended him indefinitely for violating its substance-abuse policy for a third time in as many years.
""Basically, guys, I quit,"" Irving said. ""I don't want to talk about a suspension and all this other nonsense. I'm outta there. I'm not doing this s--- no more.""
Cowboys DT David Irving, who is about to become a free agent, was suspended indefinitely for his third violation of the substance abuse and personal conduct policies in three seasons.
Of the 123 major sports teams, 82 percent play in areas where it's legal to purchase medicinal or recreational marijuana. The NHL has noticed. Who's next?
Irving specified that his problem is with the league, rather than the sport.
""Everyone questions my commitment to football, but let's get it straight, here and now,"" he said. ""I love football. ... I wouldn't be here without it. Don't get me wrong, I love football. However, I don't love the NFL. The NFL is not football, you need to understand that. What you all see us do, the game and s---, that's, what, 20 percent of all the real s--- we're doing.""
Irving appeared to be smoking marijuana during the video and spoke about how he disagreed with the NFL's policy on the substance.
• Offseason testing: Players with no previous violations are tested once.
• Regular-season testing: 10 players per team are randomly selected each week.
• Positive tests: A positive test results in a referral to the substance abuse program. A second violation results in a fine of two game checks. A third violation is four game checks. A fourth violation is a four-game suspension. A fifth violation is a 10-game suspension. A sixth violation results in a one-year banishment.
""It's funny, you know, some people: 'Oh, you're addicted to weed, you're addicted to this and that,'"" he said. ""I mean, s---, if I'm gonna be addicted to something, I'd rather be addicted to marijuana, which is medical -- it's a medicine; I do not consider it a drug -- rather than Xanax bars or the hydros or the seroquel and all that crazy s--- that they feed you.
""Like I said, it's not about smoking weed. How many NBA players you see getting in trouble about this? How many coaches you see getting in trouble about this? How many baseball players? How many UFC players getting in trouble?""
Irving will be a free agent when the league year begins next week, and the Cowboys have not expressed a desire to bring him back.

26153007,"Multiple teams inquired about Arizona Cardinals quarterback Josh Rosen's trade availability at the NFL scouting combine last week, two league sources who spoke to the Cardinals told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The Cardinals, however, did not give those teams any indication that they are willing to move on from Rosen at this time, the sources told Schefter.
This does not mean that the Cardinals won't wind up shopping Rosen eventually, but they haven't to date.
Will the Cardinals dive in for Kyler Murray, or is pass-rusher Nick Bosa still the top pick? Todd McShay goes 1-32 in this year's draft.
Reigning Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray said he won't participate in any on-field drills at the NFL combine Saturday, but said he will sit down with the Arizona Cardinals, who own the No. 1 pick in next month's draft.
Cardinals general manager Steve Keim didn't offer an unqualified endorsement of quarterback Josh Rosen.
Cardinals general manager Steve Keim caused a stir last week at the combine when he added ""right now"" when asked if Rosen was the team's starting quarterback.
""Yeah, he is, right now, for sure,"" Keim said.
The Cardinals, who hold the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft, have been connected to Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray. ESPN's Todd McShay has the Cardinals selecting Murray No. 1 overall in his most recent mock draft.
New Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury said last year, when he was at Texas Tech, that he would pick Murray No. 1 overall if he had the pick. Kingsbury's comments came ahead of Texas Tech's game against Oklahoma.
""That was obviously generous words from him,"" Murray said of Kingsbury's comment last week at the combine. ""But that's the relationship. He's always been very fond of me, and I respect that and I've never taken that for granted. He's always someone I can go to if I needed anything. It would be fun. It'd be a great deal if I was picked No. 1.""
The Cardinals traded up to select Rosen with the 10th overall pick last year. He appeared in 14 games (13 starts) during his rookie season, completing 55.2 percent of his passes and throwing for 2,278 yards with 11 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.

26248069,"The NFL's three-day negotiating window has grown so efficient that free agency, as we once knew it, is all but over once the market officially opens. At that moment Wednesday, nine of the top 10 members of ESPN's top 100 free agents -- and 17 of the top 20 -- had already committed to a team.
The twist in 2019 was a series of trades that stole the headlines. We included those deals in our initial look at the winners and losers of the NFL's 2019 free-agent frenzy. Let's dive in.

Winners | Losers | On the fence
We always seem to save a spot here for the team that spent the most and/or made the flashiest moves. But the Browns really are a better team now than they were at the end of the 2018 season, having used trades to supersede a mostly humdrum free-agent class.
They've given quarterback Baker Mayfield one of the game's top playmakers in Odell Beckham Jr. They've fortified an already formidable defensive front by acquiring pass-rusher Olivier Vernon. And at some point, they'll have tailback Kareem Hunt, who signed last month but is expected to serve a suspension for a portion of the season.
New coach Freddie Kitchens will be challenged to meld a bunch of edgy personalities, and there is some franchise inertia still to overcome, but for the first time in a quarter-century, the Browns are legitimate playoff contenders.

Recent history suggested that teams wouldn't see value in this year's big class of free-agent safeties. And reasonable people could debate the wisdom of paying top dollar to linebackers who don't rush the passer.
But the safety market exploded, starting with Landon Collins' six-year, $84 million deal with the Redskins and continuing with good contracts for Kenny Vaccaro (four years, $26 million from the Titans), Tyrann Mathieu (three years, $42 million from the Chiefs), Lamarcus Joyner (four years, $42 million from the Raiders) and Tashaun Gipson (three years, $22.5 million from the Jaguars).
Meanwhile, the Jets gave linebacker C.J. Mosley $85 million over five years, and the Vikings re-signed linebacker Anthony Barr to a deal that will at the very least pay him $16 million for 2019 (after he reversed an earlier decision to sign with the Jets). Mosley and Barr have a total of 22 sacks in 148 career games, normally the metric that dictates salaries for linebackers, but the Jets and Vikings saw past those numbers.
This week boosted the Eagles' starting quarterback on a number of levels.
First, the backup who was more than just a backup finally moved on. Nick Foles agreed to terms with the Jaguars, and while there was never any indication of unease between the two signal-callers, the Eagles' decision to let Foles leave cleans up any lingering doubts about Wentz, despite a series of injuries the past two seasons.
Second, Wentz will surely be aided by the acquisition of receiver DeSean Jackson, who is still one of the best downfield threats in the game. As Warren Sharp of Warren Football Analysis noted, Jackson excels at the routes that Wentz has thrown best during his career, namely the out and fly.
Trades involving wide receivers Antonio Brown and Beckham -- along with linebacker Khalil Mack back in September -- suggest a growing pattern: NFL players are getting better at plowing their way out of undesired situations, regardless of contract status, and coming out better on the other side.
The Raiders upgraded Brown's contract following his trade, and there have been reports that the Browns might do the same for Beckham after landing him on Tuesday. Such tactics won't necessarily work for the league's middle class, and not everyone will have the stomach to follow through. But for disgruntled stars, at least, the path isn't as bleak as it once appeared. Forcing a trade was, however, more effective this year than holding out for free agency, at least in running back Le'Veon Bell's case.

Sometimes you win for the moves you don't make.
The Patriots were more than happy to sit back and allow left tackle Trent Brown to be squired away by the richest contract for a lineman in NFL history, much as they were last year when they bid farewell to Nate Solder. The same goes for their best pass-rusher, defensive end Trey Flowers, who agreed on a five-year, $90 million deal with the Detroit Lions.

It takes incredible discipline to sit tight while players at those positions walk away, but the upside is that it prevents overpayment that eats into other priorities across the roster. It would be a questionable strategy if the Patriots hadn't shown, multiple times over the years, that they're capable of identifying and developing cheaper replacement players.
If the best organizations follow a clear vision, what can we say about the Giants?
A year ago, they were bulking up to make one final run with quarterback Eli Manning, making a series of decisions that included giving Beckham a five-year contract extension. This week, they began a fire sale with Manning still as their quarterback (at least for now). The acquisitions of safety Jabrill Peppers, guard Kevin Zeitler and additional first- and third-round picks in no way compensate for the departures of Collins, Vernon and Beckham.
The Giants now have one of the NFL's least-talented rosters, and hope for improving it is limited by their decision to let Collins walk away (rather than making a trade) and settling for a modest return in the Beckham trade. They don't seem to be following a linear plan and are years late on initiating a succession plan at quarterback. It is as though the Giants -- and general manager Dave Gettleman in particular -- are operating in a long-discarded era of NFL team building.
Vontaze Burfict is headed to Oakland as a veteran stopgap. Did the Raiders actually improve? Bill Barnwell evaluates the biggest deals.
The NFL free-agency period is here. We rank the top 100 players to hit the open market, from Le'Veon Bell to depth defenders.
Bell almost certainly cost himself millions of dollars by holding out in 2018.
Perhaps it was worth it to him to avoid again playing for the Steelers. Or perhaps it will get more money guaranteed in his next deal. But his four-year, $52.5 million contract falls short of a win. He isn't even the NFL's highest-paid running back. The Rams' Todd Gurley maintains that spot with an annual average of $14.5 million, compared to Bell's $13.1 million.
It's difficult to project how Bell will make up the money he would have earned by either signing the Steelers' final offer, which reportedly would have paid him between $14 million and $15 million annually, or by playing at the $14.55 million franchise number for 2018. The gambit kept him healthy and got him out of Pittsburgh, but it failed to generate the kind of bidding war that would have allowed him to come out ahead financially.
NFL teams are so desperate for competent line play that, once again, they tore at the handful of available starters like a bunch of hyenas.
The Raiders made Trent Brown, whose primary attribute was that he started 16 games at left tackle for the Super Bowl champions, the highest-paid offensive lineman in league history with a four-year, $66 million deal. The Packers gave Billy Turner, a swing guard/tackle, a four-year deal worth $28 million. The Bengals signed right tackle Bobby Hart to a three-year deal worth $21 million. (Neither Turner nor Hart cracked ESPN's list of the top 100 free agents.)
Those numbers should stand out to the league's upper echelon of linemen, most of whom signed contract extensions long before reaching free agency. Imagine what a player such as Packers left tackle David Bakhtiari, an All-Pro in 2018, could have gotten on the open market. (Like many players, Bakhtiari signed an extension before his rookie deal expired. The deal he agreed to in 2016 pays him an average of $12 million annually, compared to Brown's average of $16.5 million.)
Either the Steelers or Ravens have won the AFC North in 13 of its 17 seasons in existence. But they both took big hits the past week, while a new competitor emerged before their eyes.
The Steelers capitulated to one of the best players in their recent history, shipping Brown to the Raiders for a return (third- and fifth-round picks) that will make it difficult to even nearly replace his impact. The Ravens, meanwhile, bid farewell to four key players -- Mosley, safety Eric Weddle, linebacker Terrell Suggs and linebacker Za'Darius Smith -- from a defense that carried them to the playoffs last season.
Adam Schefter reports on Earl Thomas' intent to sign a four-year, $55 million deal with the Ravens.

Both the Steelers and Ravens could pick through the remaining market and replenish during the draft. The Ravens already have, to an extent, after agreeing to terms with oft-injured safety Earl Thomas and veteran running back Mark Ingram. But the rise of the Browns as legitimate division contenders, for the first time in a quarter-century, leaves much less room for error.
The Titans were one of the most active teams in the NFL this week, making three major deals by signing offensive lineman Rodger Saffold, receiver Adam Humphries and defensive end Cameron Wake while also re-signing Vaccaro at safety. I'm just not certain what to make of it.
On the one hand, giving Wake $10 million guaranteed at age 37 seems excessively hopeful. But on the other, giving relatively inaccurate quarterback Marcus Mariota a productive slot receiver in Humphries seems like a good idea. Saffold, assuming he is healthy, fits the smashmouth run style the Titans are expected to pursue.
I understand the Titans' incentive after they were in the AFC South division race until Week 17 last season. But will this eclectic haul do anything to push them past the Texans and Colts? We'll leave the Titans in the winner/loser purgatory for now.
Earlier this week, it appeared that Bridgewater was all set to return to the Saints for a second season as Drew Brees' backup. But the Dolphins have reportedly talked him into visiting their facility amid the likelihood that new coach Brian Flores will open the starting job. If so, Bridgewater faces a complex and difficult decision.
He hasn't taken a meaningful snap since 2015, and returning to New Orleans means a commitment to spending a fourth consecutive season on the sideline, with no guarantee that he would replace Brees in 2020. But should he get on the field, the Saints' offensive infrastructure offers a far better template for success than that of the Dolphins, who appear to be at the start of a long rebuilding process.
What's better for Bridgewater's long-term goal to be a starter: Getting back on the field before he is permanently classified as a backup or setting up the best possible environment for success if he does get on the field? Both options are fraught with risk.

26246212,"Odell Beckham Jr. made it clear early that he was a bit of a different guy. I remember stopping at his locker during his rookie year when the wide receiver stuck out his right hand, with fingers as long as garden hoses, and introduced himself by name before I could do the same. It was a really minor thing, but I'm pretty sure it was the first time in my three decades of sportswriting that a star athlete had done that.
Beckham would use that right hand and those endless fingers he said were passed down from his mother, a former track star, to make perhaps the NFL's most stunning regular-season touchdown catch ever in a November loss to the Dallas Cowboys. That was a window into Beckham's career with the New York Giants: moments of breathtaking brilliance set against a mind-numbing series of defeats.
The Giants can no longer straddle the line of restocking on the fly or trying to compete. They are starting over, even if it's a year too late.
The superstar receiver is headed to Cleveland, leaving behind a total rebuild in New York. Bill Barnwell dissects both sides of the deal.
Could Cleveland really be favorites to make the playoffs? How many touchdowns will OBJ score in 2019? Our experts discuss.
On Tuesday night, Giants general manager Dave Gettleman traded Beckham to the Cleveland Browns for the 17th overall pick in next month's draft, a third-round pick and safety Jabrill Peppers, who played his high school ball about a dozen miles from MetLife Stadium. Gettleman made this move not even seven months after signing Beckham to a record five-year, $95 million contract.
""We got him until he's 108,"" the GM joked that late-summer day.
As it played out, Gettleman got rid of the receiver before he even turned 27.
The old-school Giants have a card-carrying old-school GM in Gettleman, and there is no doubt that the receiver's high-maintenance ways contributed to his exit. Beckham engaged cornerback Josh Norman in the octagon, lost a fistfight with a kicking net, proposed marriage to said kicking net, took a boating vacation before his dreadful playoff performance against Green Bay -- and then punched a hole in a Lambeau Field wall -- and sat with Lil Wayne and ESPN's Josina Anderson and questioned everything from Eli Manning's arm to the team's heart.

Tom Coughlin, two-time Super Bowl-champion coach with the Giants, once said that Beckham brought qualities to the Giants ""the likes of which I've never seen."" And yet three head coaches (Coughlin, Ben McAdoo and Pat Shurmur), two general managers (Jerry Reese and Gettleman) and one team president and co-owner (John Mara) could never quite figure out how to manage Beckham and how to channel his boundless energy in a less disruptive direction.
Mara, Gettleman and Shurmur ultimately threw up their hands and said enough's enough. They sent Beckham to go play with his dear friend and LSU teammate, Jarvis Landry, and dynamic young quarterback Baker Mayfield, who stands as the polar opposite of the Giants' Manning.
The fast-breaking Browns are all set to fill the LeBron void in Cleveland.
But the Giants?
""Now they are in a full-blown rebuild, and 38-year-old Eli is still there,"" one league executive said Tuesday night. ""The running back, [Saquon] Barkley, is a first-ballot Hall of Famer if he stays healthy, but the problem is he's not a quarterback.""
In drafting Barkley with the second overall pick, and in signing Beckham to his record deal in August, the Giants declared their intent to surround the declining Manning with enough explosive playmakers to lift him back to contending form. They finished 5-11 with that plan.
The Giants' new plan involves bringing back Manning and then trading the most physically talented player they've drafted since Lawrence Taylor, absorbing a $16 million dead-cap hit on the receiver's deal in the process. In committing franchise-player money over five years to a genuine star, then bailing on him less than seven months later, the Giants organization showed why it has missed the playoffs in six of the past seven seasons.
Yes, Beckham was a handful who demanded constant care. He's not an easy employee, and he couldn't always stay on the field.
But he was a spectacular player when he was on the field, as the fastest player to 200 catches and 3,000 yards in league history (30 games). Beckham was an incredible steal as the 12th pick of the 2014 draft, and the Giants had to try everything to keep him for the long term.

Their surrender was an organizational failure, from top to bottom.
""We didn't sign him to trade him,"" Gettleman had said. Of course, if the Giants were going to move Beckham to Cleveland, they should have tried like hell before last year's draft, before they paid him the big bucks. They could've tried offering Beckham to the Browns in a package for the fourth pick, and perhaps ended up with quarterback Sam Darnold (at No. 2) and Barkley (at No. 4, after the Jets took a quarterback at No. 3). Then the Giants would've been in business.
Instead, people around the league are trying to figure out what, exactly, they're trying to accomplish. Some executives believe that the Giants might pass on Ohio State's Dwayne Haskins at No. 6, turn 2019 into a start-to-finish Eli farewell tour that will placate the fans, to some extent, during a 3-13 season, and then draft Manning's replacement in 2020.
Whatever they do, and whatever the actual plan is, the Giants failed themselves and their fan base by shipping out their otherworldly receiver. They are in the business of gathering and developing talent, and they didn't develop Beckham. They gave up on him instead. And they reminded the rest of the sport why they have lost 24 of their past 32 games.

The Oakland Raiders have released offensive tackle Donald Penn after five seasons, the team announced. The Raiders said the two sides came to a mutual decision to let Penn go. The move comes after Oakland signed Trent Brown to the richest contract for a tackle earlier in the week and drafted two tackles in the first three rounds last year.
Three-time Pro Bowl center Max Unger has decided to retire after 10 seasons, leaving a large void in the middle of the New Orleans Saints' offensive line. It's unclear how long the Saints have known about Unger's plan to retire, but they did visit with at least one free-agent guard/center this week in Nick Easton.
Tight end Tyler Eifert is re-signing with the Cincinnati Bengals on a one-year contract, a source confirmed to ESPN. Eifert, 28, broke his ankle last season on Sept. 30 against the Atlanta Falcons and was put on injured reserve after only four games, 15 receptions and one touchdown.

Newly signed wide receiver Golden Tate isn't looking at the New York Giants as a complete rebuild. He views the situation differently, even if Odell Beckham Jr., Landon Collins and Olivier Vernon are no longer with the team following recent moves. Tate said Friday after signing a lucrative new contract with the Giants that they were ""not as far off as people think."" Part of that is a belief that there are good players on the roster.
The Philadelphia Eagles have agreed to terms with cornerback Ronald Darby on a one-year deal, the team announced. Darby had two significant injuries in as many seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles. He dislocated his ankle in the 2017 opener, missing half the season, and then suffered a torn ACL this past November. He started 16 games in Philadelphia, posting four interceptions with 21 passes defensed. He started all three postseason games in 2017, finishing with six passes defensed for the Super Bowl LII champs.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have agreed to terms with linebacker Shaq Barrett on one-year deal worth $5 million, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Barrett has been a high-motor, rotational player at outside linebacker in the Denver Broncos' 3-4 defense since he first grabbed their attention as an undrafted rookie in 2014, but his playing time took a significant hit this past season with the emergence of No. 5 overall draft pick Bradley Chubb.

The Raiders will play at the Oakland Coliseum this season, and possibly in 2020, after acrimonious negotiations finally led to vote by the Coliseum Commission and an agreement on a lease.
Veteran defensive end Adrian Clayborn tweeted that the New England Patriots have granted him his release, which was a move foreshadowed based on his rising salary-cap charge ($5.9 million) and niche role from 2018. Clayborn's release will save the Patriots about $3.5 million in cap space for 2019. He played 30 percent of the defensive snaps in the 2018 regular season, with his primary contributions coming as a rusher in obvious passing situations. Clayborn's uncertain future with the team came into focus late in the year when he was a healthy scratch for Patriots' final two games. -- Mike Reiss
The NFL is suspending Cleveland Browns running back Kareem Hunt for eight games for violating its personal conduct policy, a league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Hunt's suspension stems from a February 2018 incident in which he was shown on video shoving and kicking a woman during an early-morning altercation outside his downtown Cleveland residence.
The Browns expect Kareem Hunt to be present for the start of offseason workouts April 1. Hunt can take part in OTAs, minicamps, training camp and preseason games. His suspension will not take effect until Aug. 31, the day of final roster reductions before the season opener. Hunt was take off the commissioner's exempt list when his suspension was announced.
The Jacksonville Jaguars are signing tight end Geoff Swaim, the team announced. Swaim entered the 2018 season with nine catches for 94 yards in his first three seasons but finished last season with 26 catches for 242 yards and a touchdown, becoming a starter for the Dallas Cowboys after the retirements of Jason Witten and James Hanna.

Cornerback Brian Poole has agreed to a one-year deal with the New York Jets. Poole started 21 of 47 games, including nine last season, since entering the league as an undrafted free agent in 2016.
Cimini: Analysis for every Jets signing
Barnwell's grade: B
With Buster Skrine signing with the Bears, the Jets found a new slot corner in Brian Poole, a non-tender free agent who played three seasons with the Falcons. He's signing a one-year, $3.5 million contract, per ESPN's Adam Schefter — more than he would've made on the Atlanta tender. Poole's coverage slipped a bit last season and he committed a career-high seven penalties (five accepted). He's an excellent blitzer, which makes him a good fit in Gregg Williams' pressure scheme. Right now, the top three corners are Trumaine Johnson, Darryl Roberts and Poole. Mo Claiborne is not expected to re-sign.
Free agent quarterback Teddy Bridgewater will return to the New Orleans Saints as a backup to Drew Brees, sources told ESPN on Thursday. He will sign a one-year, $7.25 million, fully guaranteed contract with the Saints, a league source told ESPN. Sources said Bridgewater, who is from Miami, listened to and did have interest in playing for the Dolphins, with whom he met Wednesday, before ultimately deciding against a move.
The Saints’ trade for Teddy Bridgewater last summer paid off. The 26-year-old QB agreed to stay in New Orleans as a backup and potential successor to Drew Brees rather than leave for an immediate starting opportunity with the Dolphins, according to ESPN’s Dianna Russini. It remains to be seen how long the 40-year-old Brees plans to keep playing – and how long the Saints will be willing to keep paying both QBs. But both sides obviously liked the fit last season after the Saints traded a third-round pick in exchange for Bridgewater and a sixth-rounder in late August.

The San Francisco 49ers have signed free agent receiver Jordan Matthews to a one-year deal. Matthews, 26, appeared in 14 games and posted 20 receptions for 300 yards with two touchdowns in Philadelphia last season.
Wagoner: Analysis for every 49ers signing
The 49ers added to their needy receiver corps on Thursday, signing Jordan Matthews to a one-year deal. Matthews instantly becomes one of the biggest targets on the roster and could improve the team's woeful red zone offense, which ranked last in the league in 2018 in touchdown percentage. At 6'3, Matthews offers good size and 16 of his 22 career touchdowns have come inside the opponent's 20.
The Kansas City Chiefs have agreed to a three-year contract with defensive end Alex Okafor, a source told ESPN. Okafor will help the Chiefs' pass rush after the team released linebacker Justin Houston and traded linebacker Dee Ford to the San Francisco 49ers.
Teicher: Analysis for every Chiefs signing
Barnwell's grade: C-
The Chiefs’ contract agreement with Alex Okafor gives them a veteran defensive end for their new 4-3 base defensive system. Okafor, who has 22 sacks in six NFL seasons with the Cardinals and the Saints, hasn’t been a prolific pass rusher. But they believe he can improve his production. He had four sacks in 16 starts last season for New Orleans.
The Oakland Raiders began clearing salary-cap space after their spending spree, releasing wide receiver Jordy Nelson and quarterback AJ McCarron on Thursday, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The release of Nelson comes after the Raiders spent big at the wide receiver position by acquiring Antonio Brown in a trade and then restructuring his contract to give him more money, and signing Tyrell Williams to a four-year contract.
The New York Giants began to try to fill the void left when they traded wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. by agreeing to a deal with Golden Tate on Thursday. It's a four-year, $37.5 million deal that includes $23 million fully guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Raanan: Analysis for every Giants signing
Barnwell's grade: D+
Golden Tate is an interesting signing in Pat Shurmur's offense that includes a lot of crossing routes. He ""turns into a RB with the ball in his hands,"" according to a scout who knows him well. Tate uses his size to his advantage and breaks a lot of tackles. He's an interesting complement to TE Evan Engram and WR Sterling Shepard. The Giants still have no shortage of weapons.
The Carolina Panthers have released left tackle Matt Kalil. The move comes after the team re-signed offensive tackle Daryl Williams to a one-year contract. The team also signed center Matt Paradis to a three-year contract.
The Panthers have released left tackle Mart Kalil, a source confirmed to ESPN.com. This clears $7.25 in salary cap space. It is a post-June 1 designation. Not a surprise considering Carolina re-signed tackle Daryl Williams. Ian Rapoport forêt reported.
Pro Bowl safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix agreed to a one-year deal with the Chicago Bears. Clinton-Dix, 26, spent the final nine games with the Washington Redskins last season after he was acquired in a trade with the Green Bay Packers.
Seifert: Analysis for every Bears signing
Barnwell's grade: A
Free agent safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix has agreed to a one-year deal with the Chicago Bears, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter and others. The Bears will be Clinton-Dix's third team since the start of the 2018 season. He'll have a chance to replace Adrian Amos, who signed a lucrative deal this week with the Green Bay Packers. Clinton-Dix, a 2014 first-round pick of the Packers, was a Pro Bowl player in 2016 but his play dipped since then. The Packers traded him to the Washington Redskins midway through last season.
The New Orleans Saints have agreed to a three-year contract with former New England Patriots defensive tackle Malcom Brown, a source told ESPN. The move comes after Drew Brees restructured his contract to create more than $10 million in salary-cap space for the Saints.
Triplett: Analysis for every Saints signing
The Saints filled one of their biggest needs by agreeing to a three-year deal with former Patriots starting DT Malcom Brown, a source confirmed. The deal was first reported by the NFL Network. Brown (6-2, 320 pounds) should replace free agent Tyeler Davison as the Saints' starting nose tackle, but he also has the versatility to be a penetrating DT. He has 8.5 sacks in four seasons. The Saints have some depth concerns at their other DT spot, where starter Sheldon Rankins is recovering from a torn Achilles and backup David Onyemata could potentially face league discipline for a marijuana possession charge.
The San Francisco 49ers are signing former Los Angeles Chargers cornerback Jason Verrett to a one-year, $3.6 million deal, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Verrett suffered an Achilles tendon tear during a conditioning test a day before the start of Chargers' training camp last year, forcing the TCU product to miss the entire 2018 season.

The up-and-coming Cleveland Browns were willing to do what the fading New York Giants wouldn't: take a chance on Odell Beckham Jr.'s talent and hope his baggage doesn't weigh down the team. ""I know Odell is very passionate,"" Browns general manager John Dorsey said on a conference call. ""I know he is competitive. I know he can help this football team and if you get a chance to acquire a guy like that, you know what, take a shot at it. We acquired him.""

Cimini: Analysis for every Jets signing
The New Orleans Saints created more than $10 million in salary-cap space by restructuring quarterback Drew Brees' contract -- which has become almost an annual ritual for a team that is routinely slammed tight against the cap. The team also has visits planned for Thursday:
While most teams started free agency with a flurry, the Saints are just getting warmed up – with some major decisions coming in the next few days. They have visits scheduled with top TE Jared Cook, standout edge rusher Ezekiel Ansah and defensive lineman Mario Edwards. And they're still waiting on a decision from backup QB Teddy Bridgewater, who visited the Dolphins on Wednesday. The Saints restructured Drew Brees' contract to carve out some salary-cap room for at least one or two more big moves to come.

Wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who was traded from the New York Giants to the Cleveland Browns, thanked the Giants organization on Instagram:
 So many mixed emotions and feelings. This is all, a lot to process but it is reality. I don't kno exactly what to say so just gotta keep it real and short. I want to thank the NY giants organization for giving me an opportunity to do what God put me on this earth to do , I want to thank the organization and the owners for everything and especially giving me my first chance to be a part of the NFL.

The New York Jets are bringing back defensive tackle Steve McLendon:
By retaining locker-room favorite Steve McLendon, the Jets helped their depth on the defensive line. At 33, he's a first- and second-down player who can play 20 to 30 snaps a game. He's probably a better rotational player at this point in his career. He played 42 percent of the snaps in 2018, and saw a slight decline in his production: His work ethic is contagious, and he's great for team chemistry. The starting defensive line remains intact, with Henry Anderson also returning, but there could be a big addition in the draft, Quinnen Williams or maybe Nick Bosa.
Free-agent linebacker K.J. Wright isn't going anywhere, telling ESPN's Josina Anderson, ""I am coming back to Seattle."" Wright said he will receive a two-year deal for up to $15 million.

Former Jacksonville Jaguars receiver Donte Moncrief reached agreement on a two-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Moncrief signed a one-year contract worth a guaranteed $9.6 million with the Jaguars last March. He caught 48 passes for 668 yards, which were his highest totals since he caught 64 passes for 733 yards in his second season in 2015. That also was the last time he played in all 16 games.

The New England Patriots and free-agent receiver Phillip Dorsett have agreed to a one-year deal, a source confirmed to ESPN. The 5-foot-10, 192-pound Dorsett had been a valuable backup for the Patriots since being acquired in a 2017 trade from the Indianapolis Colts in exchange for quarterback Jacoby Brissett.

The Jacksonville Jaguars waived quarterback Blake Bortles on Wednesday, cutting ties with the player they took third overall in 2014 after five tumultuous seasons, just hours after signing free-agent quarterback Nick Foles. The move will cost the Jaguars $16.5 million in dead money but also save the team $4.3 million against the salary cap in 2019. Bortles was guaranteed to make $6.5 million this season and was due a $1 million roster bonus on the fifth day of the league year.
DiRocco: Bortles was one of best QBs in Jaguars history
Releasing Blake Bortles without a post-June 1 designation means the Jaguars will absorb a $16.5 million dead cap hit and save only $4.5 million. Bortles was guaranteed $6.5 million this year. He also was due a $1 million roster bonus on the fifth day of the 2019 league year (Sunday), but obviously will not receive that now. The Jaguars now have four quarterbacks under contract for 2019: Nick Foles, Cody Kessler, Tanner Lee, and Alex McGough.
Even as they signal a commitment to a rebuilding plan, the New York Giants still do not plan to move on from 38-year-old quarterback Eli Manning this year, according to multiple sources familiar with their plan. Manning has one year left on his contract. He is scheduled to earn an $11.5 million salary, a $500,000 workout bonus and a $5 million roster bonus if he is still on the roster at 4 p.m. ET Sunday.

Saying his ultimate goal is to pass Jerry Rice as the NFL's all-time leading receiver, a mellow Antonio Brown also talked about bringing a higher level of accountability to his teammates while being praised for his legendary on-field work ethic in his introductory media conference as the newest member of the Oakland Raiders on Wednesday.
Mike Mayock said the Raiders did not get involved with Antonio Brown until after the Buffalo deal fell apart on Friday. Jon Gruden said they all got together in Las Vegas with Raiders owner Mark Davis that night.
Pro Bowl returner Andre Roberts is signing with the Buffalo Bills, sources told ESPN. Roberts, who turned 31 in January, proved last season that you're never too old to be a breakout star. After signing a one-year contract with the New York Jets for the veterans minimum (a total of $1 million, including bonuses), Roberts was selected to his first Pro Bowl after scoring on two returns -- one punt, one kickoff.

The Miami Dolphins will meet with free-agent quarterback Teddy Bridgewater on Wednesday evening, sources confirmed to ESPN. Bridgewater will have a decision to make between staying in New Orleans as a backup and potentially a long-term option to replace Drew Brees when he retires or leaving for Miami, where he would have an opportunity to start in 2019.
The San Francisco 49ers are signing running back Tevin Coleman to a two-year, $10 million deal, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Coleman, known as an explosive, big-play threat, averaged a career-best 4.8 yards per carry while starting 14 of 16 games for the Atlanta Falcons in 2018 as two-time Pro Bowler Devonta Freeman underwent season-ending groin surgery. Coleman finished the season with 800 yards and four touchdowns on 167 attempts, and he also caught 32 passes for 276 yards and five TDs. The 49ers also agreed to terms to re-sign defensive back Jimmie Ward on a one-year deal worth up to $5 million, league sources told ESPN's Nick Wagoner, confirming an earlier report.

The Kansas City Chiefs released safety Eric Berry at the start of the new league year. The move comes with the team set to add Tyrann Mathieu, who agreed to a three-year, $42 million contract with the team this week.
Teicher: Berry and the Chiefs -- Inspiration and unfulfilled potential
The signing of Tyrann Mathieu, as it turns out, does mean the end for Eric Berry with the Chiefs. They've released him, even though the salary cap savings will only be $1.5 million. What could have been? Berry was with Chiefs for nine years but missed almost all of four seasons because of injury or illness. Interested to see what is next for hm.
The Miami Dolphins continued their roster purge at the start of the league year Wednesday by releasing veteran guard Josh Sitton. Sitton is likely to wind up with the New York Jets, a source tells ESPN's Adam Schefter. There he would reunite with former Dolphins and current Jets coach Adam Gase.
Right tackle Daryl Williams is re-signing with the Carolina Panthers on a one-year deal, a source tells ESPN's Adam Schefter. This will be a prove-it year for Williams after an injury-plagued 2018 season.

Free-agent running back Adrian Peterson has informed ESPN's Josina Anderson that he is ""going back to the Redskins."" He said he will receive a two-year contract, and sources told ESPN's John Keim that the total value is $8 million. ""I feel like we made some good moves to get to where we are trying to go,"" Peterson said.
Keim: Analysis for every Redskins signing
Barnwell's grade: C
The Redskins made a solid and necessary move by re-signing running back Adrian Peterson to a two-year deal worth up to $8 million. It's uncertain how much is guaranteed but there likely will be plenty of incentives. However, with Derrius Guice coming off a torn ACL - and having had knee issues in the past -- the Redskins need to be covered just in case he's not the same player. Or if it takes him time to handle a full load. Peterson would be a good mentor for Guice -- if he pays attention to the NFL's eighth all-time leading rusher. Peterson's work ethic and study habits impressed teammates and coaches in Washington last season. And he showed he could still play with 1,042 yards including 119 in a Week 16 loss at Tennessee. Peterson might not hit the consistent home runs anymore, but he can still elude defenders for extra yards. Peterson might be 34, but he still has something to offer.
The Atlanta Falcons informed former starting right tackle Ryan Schraeder of his release, agent Joel Turner told ESPN. Schraeder, who lost his job to Ty Sambrailo at the end of last season, had three years and $18.8 million remaining on his contract. His release saves $3.95 million against the Falcons' 2019 cap.

Hensley: Analysis of every Ravens signing
Ravens reach a four-year, $55 million deal with safety Earl Thomas, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. This gives Baltimore its best ballhawk since soon-to-be Hall of Famer Ed Reed left after the 2012 Super Bowl season. The Ravens' first major signing in free agency will fill the void left by Eric Weddle, who was cut last week. Thomas, 30 has drawn comparisons to Reed throughout his career because of his great range. He has intercepted 28 passes and gone to six Pro Bowls in nine seasons with the Seattle Seahawks. He always covered lots of ground in a one deep safety defense, which would allow safety Tony Jefferson to play closer to the line of scrimmage. The concern with Thomas is durability. His left leg has been broken twice (in 2016 and 2018), and he has missed 19 games over the past three seasons. But Thomas never missed a game from 2010 to 2015. After last year's top-ranked defense lost five key members in free agency, the arrival of Thomas is a step toward rebuilding it.

This is a homecoming for Bolden, who played for the Patriots from 2012-2017 before spending the 2018 season in Miami after being cut by New England right before the season. Had Bolden not left for Miami, he probably would have returned to the Patriots one week later after RB Jeremy Hill tore his ACL in the season-opener and New England needed reinforcements. Bolden, 29, is more of a reserve and strong special teams and locker-room presence. His return should be well received by teammates from a culture standpoint. NFL Network first reported the agreement between the Patriots and Bolden.

Trading Odell Beckham Jr. signifies a true rebuild for the Giants. It also raises questions why didn't they do it before they signed him to a then-record contract seven months ago. Now they incur another $16 million in dead money and paid him $21.5 million for 12 games. Last year was the ideal time to rebuild if that is the direction the organization was going.

Henry Anderson, one of GM Mike Maccagnan's best finds, isn't going anywhere. Good move for both sides to continue the marriage — a three-year, $25M deal. You could argue he was their most effective defensive linemen last season. He recorded a career-high seven sacks despite being doubled on a team-high 60 percent of the snaps, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Anderson is a good fit in Gregg Williams' 3-4, and he can slide inside on passing downs. He's only 27, so he's in his prime years.

Although Brown played every game and almost 98 percent of the defensive snaps in Buffalo, he played only seven games in Cincinnati.
Terrell: Analysis of every Bengals signing
The Bengals have re-signed LB Preston Brown, according to ESPN's Dianna Russini. It's hard to judge his 2018 season. Brown never really got a chance to show what he could do in Cincinnati after getting injured Week 1 and then ultimately ending up on IR for a different injury. Prior to coming to the Bengals, he had never missed a game. Brown took a one-year deal last year because he wanted to be in Cincinnati. If the Bengals don't make any other moves with the LBs, then the 2019 linebackers are WLB Vontaze Burfict, MLB Preston Brown and SLB Nick Vigil. But this certainly doesn't mean the Bengals aren't still looking or potentially thinking about drafting a linebacker, considering Burfict hasn't been very reliable or available for much of the last few years.
Former Arizona Cardinals safety Deone Bucannon has reached agreement on a one-year deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

McClure: Analysis of every Falcons signing
Falcons addressing the offensive line via free agency. Adam Schefter reports the team is signing former Jets left guard James Carpenter to a four-year contract. Carpenter has 97 career starts with both the Jets and Seattle Seahawks, primarily at left guard. As ESPN's Rich Cimini noted, Carpenter coming off shoulder surgery and didn't finish the season. Falcons also set to sign guard Jamon Brown to a three-year deal, a source told ESPN. Brown started eight games for the Giants at right guard last season. Falcons not content with what they have at guard next to Alex Mack with Wes Schweitzer more of a backup and Brandon Fusco coming back from a broken ankle. This probably means the Falcons will address defensive tackle with the 14th overall pick in the draft despite interest in Oklahoma's Cody Ford and others.

The Buffalo Bills intend to sign former Washington Redskins offensive tackle Ty Nsekhe to a free-agent deal Wednesday, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The deal is for two years and worth $14.5 million with $7.7 million guaranteed, his agent Vincent Taylor said. Nsekhe was the Redskins' swing tackle the past four seasons -- never the full-time starter -- but that sort of money indicates Nsekhe will replace free agent Jordan Mills as the Bills' starting right tackle. That means Buffalo is likely to have at least three new starters along the offensive line this season: Mitch Morse (center), Spencer Long (right guard) and Nsekhe (right tackle).

Zay Jones (2017 second-round pick) and Robert Foster (2018 undrafted rookie) project to round out of the top four of the depth chart, although the exact pecking order remains to be seen and the Bills could still search for a more prototypical No. 1 receiver in the draft.

The New England Patriots have placed an original-round tender on suspended/restricted free-agent WR Josh Gordon ($2.025 million). This counts against the team's salary cap. So if Gordon is ever reinstated by the NFL, he would be looking at a one-year, $2.025 million contract. Technically, another team could sign him to an offer sheet, and if the Patriots didn't match it, the club would receive a second-round draft pick in return because that's the round in which Gordon entered the NFL. But draft-pick compensation, and financial terms of a contract, are naturally secondary to Gordon's health and well-being at this point.

The Jets struck again in a big way, adding Pro Bowl LB CJ Mosley to their new-look linebacking corps. He will join Anthony Barr and Avery Williamson, and it raises questions about the futures of Jordan Jenkins and Darron Lee — especially Lee. Mosley is a terrific player who will bring toughness and tackling ability, but the contract is exorbitant— five years, $85M, including a $51M guarantee. Normally, you have those contracts for elite pass rushers. Mosley is many things, but he's not that.
In a span of a week, the NFL's top-ranked defense has now lost its two signal-callers in C.J. Mosley and safety Eric Weddle along with its most tenured player in linebacker Terrell Suggs. Mosley, Weddle and Suggs have combined for 460 NFL starts and 17 Pro Bowls.

A longtime face of the Baltimore Ravens' defense is saying goodbye. Outside linebacker Terrell Suggs told members of the Ravens on Monday he is moving on, a source told ESPN. One of the top leaders and characters in franchise history, he had spent his entire 16-year NFL career in Baltimore.
Terrell Suggs informed the Ravens that he's signing elsewhere, and this departure will be felt more than any other in Baltimore this offseason. For 16 years, Suggs was as much a part of the Ravens' storied defensive tradition as Ray Lewis and Ed Reed. The best way to put it is this: Lewis was the heart, Reed was the soul and Suggs was the funny bone. One of the biggest personalities in team history, Suggs was a seven-time Pro Bowl player and the 2011 defensive rookie of the year. He is the only active player with 900 tackles, 100 sacks and 30 forced fumbles. Suggs often talked about how he wanted to be a ""Raven for life"" and spend his entire career in Baltimore like Lewis and Jonathan Ogden. Instead, he'll finish out a potential Hall of Fame career somewhere else like Reed and Haloti Ngata.
Former Baltimore Ravens DE Terrell Suggs, who is expected to sign with the Arizona Cardinals, had 132.5 sacks in his Ravens career, tied with Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor for the third-most by any player with a single franchise, trailing only Bruce Smith (171) with the Bills and Michael Strahan (141.5) with the Giants since sacks became official in 1982.

The addition of DeSean Jackson gives the Eagles the exact type of receiver balance they strive for: a deep threat working opposite a physical force in Alshon Jeffery. Carson Wentz will have some fun airing it out to Jackson, and it should open up even more space for guys like Zach Ertz across the middle.
The Jacksonville Jaguars will sign former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles to a four-year deal worth $88 million, according to ESPN and multiple sources. The deal includes $50.125 million in guaranteed money, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Barnwell's grade: C-
The $50.125 million in guaranteed money (per ESPN's Adam Schefter) the Jaguars are giving QB Nick Foles is the largest amount of guaranteed money in franchise history. DT Malik Jackson, who was released last week, got $42 million guaranteed when he signed in 2016. Foles was the Jaguars' top target and the contract shows they're clearly committed to him as their starter beyond 2020, and it also likely takes quarterback off the board in the first round of the draft, even if Dwayne Haskins were to slip to them at No. 7.
The Tennessee Titans intend to sign safety Kenny Vaccaro to a contract to remain in Nashville on a four-year contract worth $26 million, with $11.5 million guaranteed, according to multiple reports.

Rothstein: Analysis for every Lions signing
The Detroit Lions are all about business here on the first day of the legal tampering period, agreeing to terms with their third free agent of need (not counting Danny Amendola, who signed Monday) by snagging tight end Jesse James from Pittsburgh. James was one of the top tight ends in a somewhat underwhelming tight end market but he will solve an obvious hole for Detroit at the position. Both Bob Quinn and Matt Patricia identified tight end as a definitive position of need and went out and got a good one in James. James has 120 career catches for 1,189 yards and nine touchdowns with the Steelers. He should immediately slide into the No. 1 tight end spot and give Matthew Stafford a tall target in the red zone at 6-foot-7.

Barnwell's grade: C+
Bob Quinn needed a pass rusher. He found one in Trey Flowers, the top edge rusher on the market and one that both he and Lions head coach Matt Patricia are familiar with. Patricia nabbed a player who he is very familiar with and is a player who knows Detroit's defense. Flowers can move all around the Lions' defense and will pair with Romeo Okwara to become a strong pair of edge rushers. This is the move the Lions had to get done and three hours after the legal tampering period could begin, they got it accomplished.
Former New York Giants Pro Bowl safety Landon Collins told ESPN's Josina Anderson he will sign with the Washington Redskins. The deal is for six years, $84 million, including $45 million in guaranteed money, according to multiple reports.

The Redskins will be signing safety Landon Collins, who told ESPN's Josina Anderson the news. He'll receive a deal worth up to $84 million for six years, per multiple reports. That's serious money and partly a function of their inability to draft and develop anyone at this position for most of the past decade. But he gives them one of the best in-the-box safeties in the NFL and also someone who can help improve the culture and leadership on Washington's defense. That was sorely needed. He also grew up a big fan of late Redskins safety Sean Taylor and wore his number 21 with the New York Giants.

Barnwell's grade: D+
The 49ers strike early and heavily in free agency as they intend to sign LB Kwon Alexander to a four-year, $54 million deal, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Alexander should fit in at the team's WIL linebacker spot alongside Fred Warner. While Alexander makes sense for the Niners, the cost here is exorbitant and not just in terms of Alexander's money. This is the price the Niners are paying for the swing and a miss on Reuben Foster. Foster was supposed to be the guy to hold this job and because he couldn't avoid trouble, the Niners found themselves having to spend big at the position. The trickle down effect of that could mean they're unable to fill other holes on their defense.
The Cleveland Browns have released tight end Darren Fells. He spent one year in Cleveland and had 11 catches for 117 yards and three touchdowns. David Njoku, Seth DeValve, Pharaoh Brown and Orson Charles are on the roster at the position.
Here's what the Dallas Cowboys are planning at the start of free agency:
Clearly, it’s early on in the legal tampering period, but the sense is that things will be quiet with the Cowboys in the next few days in free agency. The focus is still on their own players, especially DeMarcus Lawrence. While everybody wants to connect the Earl Thomas dots, the feeling is the price will be a lot more than what the Cowboys want to pay.
The Arizona Cardinals will release veteran tight end Jermaine Gresham on Thursday for cap reasons, according to ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. Gresham's cap hit was to be $8.2 million in 2019. Gresham had a career-low nine catches for 94 yards in 2018.
The Philadelphia Eagles signed left tackle Jason Peters to a new one-year contract Monday, keeping the veteran in the fold for 2019.

The Los Angeles Rams announced on Sunday that they've agreed to terms on a new deal with outside linebacker Dante Fowler Jr. The club didn't release terms, but ESPN's Adam Schefter reported the deal is for one year.

Fowler joined the team midseason after he was traded from the Jacksonville Jaguars, but was set to become an unrestricted free agent. In 8 regular season games, Fowler had 2 sacks, a pass deflection and a forced fumble. He also had a key pressure in overtime of the NFC Championship game that forced Drew Brees into an errant throw that S John Johnson III intercepted. The Rams have settled two pressing offseason needs before the start of free agency by agreeing to terms with Fowler and signing safety Eric Weddle.
The Oakland Raiders have agreed to a two-year contract with defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Breeland Speaks is the player who stands to benefit the most from Justin Houston's departure. The Chiefs moved up last year in the second round to draft Speaks in the second round, in part in anticipation of losing either Houston or Dee Ford this year. The Chiefs used Speaks as an outside linebacker in their base 3-4 defense last year but he will be a defensive end in their 4-3 system under new cooordinator Steve Spagnuolo. ""Most people and even our organization too, thought his natural fit was more of a 4-3 D-end,'' general manager Brett Veach said last month shortly after Spagnuolo was hired.
The Detroit Lions will be looking for a new starting cornerback, as the club is releasing Nevin Lawson days before the start of the new league year, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Lawson was a consistent if not flashy cornerback for the Lions. A fourth-round pick by the Lions in 2014, he played in 62 games for Detroit, starting 54 of them, including being a full-time starter over the past three seasons with the club.

The Pittsburgh Steelers have agreed to trade prolific but disgruntled receiver Antonio Brown to the Oakland Raiders in exchange for a third- and fifth-round pick, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Brown will receive a new three-year deal worth up to $54.125 million from the Raiders, with $30.125 million guaranteed, the source said. He previously had three years and $38.9 million left on his contract with the Steelers, with none of the money guaranteed.

The Pittsburgh Steelers will be relieved but probably not elated with the draft haul in the Antonio Brown trade. They sought what GM Kevin Colbert called ‘significant' compensation and walked away with a third- and a fifth-round pick, which hardly guarantees finding a star receiver to replace Brown. But Pittsburgh's options were limited by Brown's contract demands and behavior over the last few months. Many teams dropped out. At least now they can move on with a new era of Steelers football, beginning with the re-signing of Ben Roethlisberger.
It didn't take long for running back Carlos Hyde to find another job, as he agreed to a one-year deal with the Kansas City Chiefs on Saturday, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The deal is for $2.8 million, with $1.6 million being guaranteed, a source told Schefter.
Newly signed Carlos Hyde may fill the RB2 spot occupied at the end of last season by Spencer Ware, who is headed to free agency. But Hyde could eventually claim a significant amount of playing time from Damien Williams, who for now at least is the Chiefs’ main featured back. Hyde at 235 pounds is a big, versatile back of the type favored by general manager Brett Veach. “We certainly like bigger backs,’’ Veach said recently at the NFL combine. “I kind of have a thing for 220-pound backs that can run and catch and block.’’ The Chiefs could also draft a back, though it’s not the necessity it was before the Hyde signing. “When you get into rounds 2 and 3, we have our eyes on a couple of (running backs),’’ Veach said. “Certainly we’d be happy with a few guys.’’

Allen, who spent the last two seasons with the New England Patriots, becomes the most experienced and accomplished tight end on the Dolphins roster. 

He had three catches for 27 yards in 13 games (eight starts) last season with the Patriots. Allen's best skillset is as a blocker and he will likely compete with 2018 second-round pick Mike Gesicki for Miami's starting tight end job.

The Detroit Lions released veteran guard T.J. Lang on Friday with one year left on his contract -- ending a question that had lingered throughout the offseason. Lions general manager Bob Quinn said at the NFL scouting combine last week that the team was still deciding on what to do with the former Pro Bowler, whom the team signed to a three-year deal before the 2017 season.
The Lions releasing T.J. Lang does give the franchise a little bit more than $8.5 million more in cap space but it also creates a large hole on the offensive line. Detroit will have some flexibility since both Frank Ragnow and Graham Glasgow can play guard and center, so the club can go after whichever interior offensive linemen they would think fits best in the draft or free agency. And there was little way Detroit could have justified keeping Lang with the $11 million-plus cap hit he would have be on the books for in 2019. 
Lang was a smart addition at the time for the Lions and when he was healthy, he was outstanding -- including a Pro Bowl appearance. But injuries were the main issue with the Michigan native and the franchise just couldn't have relied on him again.
When it comes to free agency, this extra money could give Detroit some flexibility to go after a high-level option like Landon Collins or Trey Flowers. Denver center Matt Paradis, Bills guard John Miller, Chiefs center Mitch Morse and Rams guard Rodger Saffold are the best potential offensive line options in free agency.
The Jacksonville Jaguars released five players on Friday, headlined by defensive tackle Malik Jackson, a move that will save the team $30 million. In addition to Jackson, the Jaguars also released safety Tashaun Gipson, running back Carlos Hyde, right tackle Jermey Parnell and long-snapper Carson Tinker. The moves were made, in part, to create salary-cap space to sign a veteran quarterback, expected to be Nick Foles.

That said the Broncos will still pay $4 million cash to ship Keenum to the Redskins after he was their starter for just one season.
The Antonio Brown sweepstakes hasn't stopped the Pittsburgh Steelers from doing big business with their big people.

A source confirms Foster is signing for two years and is worth $8.25 million.
Veteran wide receiver Pierre Garcon will become a free agent after the San Francisco 49ers passed on his option for 2019, the team announced Thursday. The 49ers opted to take on $7.2 million in dead money rather than carry Garcon's cap number of $8.275 million. In two seasons with the Niners, Garcon had 64 catches for 786 yards with one touchdown while appearing in 16 games.
The Miami Dolphins are diving headfirst into a rebuild, with the first step being to get cumbersome veteran contracts off the books. They started that process Thursday by releasing defensive end Andre Branch and guard Ted Larsen. The moves will save Miami $9.15 million in salary-cap space.

The Cleveland Browns have released linebacker Jamie Collins Sr., the team announced Wednesday. Releasing Collins will cost the Browns only $2.5 million in salary-cap space this season and saves the Browns $9.25 million in cap costs in 2019 and $13.75 million in 2020. Collins had been due to earn $10 million in salary in 2019 and $12 million in 2020.
The Browns choice right now to step in for Jamie Collins would be Genard Avery, who got a lot of time as a rookie after Christian Kirksey was placed on injured reserve. Avery could stand up on early downs, then rush in passing downs. On the free agent market, C.J. Mosley, who played inside for the Ravens, and Anthony Barr (Vikings) seem the most expensive options.  Preston Smith of the Redskins is well thought of, and Kwon Alexander played well in Tampa Bay and is on the road to recovery after tearing his ACL in the Bucs win over the Browns in October.
The Denver Broncos, in need of salary-cap space before free agency opens, have informed safety Darian Stewart that he'll be released. Stewart, who had two years remaining on his four-year extension through 2020, was slated to count $6.37 million against the salary cap in 2019.

Dimitroff has been in talks with Jarrett's agent, Todd France, regarding a long-term contract extension, yet the sides remain far apart.

The Seattle Seahawks placed the franchise tag on defensive end Frank Clark on Monday, ensuring that Seattle's top pass-rusher will now stay put through at least the 2019 season. The Seahawks' announcement that they've tagged Clark specifies that it's the non-exclusive tag, as expected. It means Clark is free to negotiate with other teams. If he were to sign an offer sheet that the Seahawks declined to match, Seattle would be entitled to two first-round picks from the other team.
Franchise tag tracker: What's behind SEA tagging Clark
The Seahawks are using the franchise tag on Frank Clark, according to ESPN's Dan Graziano and others. It means Clark remains under contract for at least another season at a salary of $17.128 million. The two sides can continue to negotiate a long-term deal until July 15. Signing Clark long-term would be beneficial to the Seahawks from a short-term cap standpoint as it would lower Clark's 2019 cap charge from the $17.128 million. It would also free up the franchise tag for the Seahawks to use it next year on Russell Wilson if they're unable to sign their quarterback to an extension before then. But with the tag at their disposal in 2019, there was no way the Seahawks were going to let Clark walk. This was the expected move.
Unable to reach an agreement on a long-term deal before the deadline, the Dallas Cowboys on Monday used the franchise-tag designation on Pro Bowl defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence for the second consecutive year, a source confirmed. Unlike last year, the Cowboys hope to work out an extension with Lawrence before the July 15 deadline to play the season on the tag.
Archer: Tag in place, what's next for Cowboys, DeMarcus Lawrence?
Franchise tag tracker: What's behind DAL tagging Lawrence
The next key date in the DeMarcus Lawrence talks is July 15. If he doesn’t have a long-term deal done, then he will have to play the season on the $20.5 million tag. The Cowboys want to get a long-term deal done and there are indications talks will continue. In 2015, the Cowboys worked out a five-year, $70 million deal with Dez Bryant minutes before the July deadline. Bryant took part only sparingly in the offseason program. A source said Lawrence will not take part in any work without a long-term deal after signing the $17.1 million tag quickly in 2018. The last time the Cowboys used the tag in consecutive years on a player came in 2012-13 with outside linebacker Anthony Spencer.
The Philadelphia Eagles and starting left guard Isaac Seumalo agreed to a three-year contract extension on Monday, the team announced. Seumalo, 25, is the second Eagles starting offensive lineman to receive an extension this offseason, joining center Jason Kelce, who agreed to a one-year extension on Saturday that put him under contract through 2021.
The Houston Texans have used their franchise tag on defensive end/outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney, the team announced Monday. The team used the non-exclusive franchise designation, meaning a team can sign Clowney to an offer sheet once free agency begins next week but would have to surrender two first-round draft picks if the Texans choose not to match it.
Barshop: Why the Texans should sign Jadeveon Clowney to long-term deal
Franchise tag tracker: What's behind Houston tagging Clowney
Jadeveon Clowney is listed as a DE/OLB because he plays all over the field for the Texans, but according to ESPN Stats & Info, in 2018 he played 729 snaps at DE, 101 snaps at DT and 33 at LB.
The Tennessee Titans are expected to release safety Johnathan Cyprien sometime this week, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The Titans would like Cyprien back, but for less money than the $5.5 million base salary he was scheduled to be paid in 2019.
Barring any last-minute snags, the Jacksonville Jaguars are expected to sign the free-agent quarterback to a multiyear contract when the new league year opens next week, according to sources. The Jaguars are expected to release quarterback Blake Bortles and install Foles as their starter. Jacksonville will have to pay $6.5 million of Bortles' 2019 salary, which was fully guaranteed when he signed his current contract last year.

The San Francisco 49ers and starting right guard Mike Person have reached agreement on a three-year, $9 million deal that includes $3 million guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Person was scheduled to become a free agent. The 49ers signed Person late in June of last year with hopes that he could offer some depth and versatility as a backup on the offensive line. As it turned out, Person provided much more than that, starting all 16 games at right guard.
The Kansas City Chiefs are placing their franchise tag on linebacker Dee Ford and plan to have him in their lineup this season, but with the change to a 4-3 defensive scheme, they will listen to trade offers for him, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The Chiefs intend to switch their base defensive scheme to a 4-3 under new coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, which likely would mean a move to defensive end for Ford, who played that position in college before moving to linebacker for Kansas City.
Franchise-tag tracker: What's behind KC tagging Ford
It's not a surprise that the Chiefs would name LB Dee Ford their franchise player, as ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported they will. What is a surprise is Schefter’s report that the Chiefs would listen to trade offers for Ford. That suggests the Chiefs are looking to unload either of last season’s two edge rushers, Ford and Justin Houston, and install Breeland Speaks as a starter at defensive end in their new 4-3 base scheme. The Chiefs drafted Speaks in the second round last year.
The Atlanta Falcons and backup quarterback Matt Schaub have agreed to a two-year contract extension, the team announced Saturday. Schaub, who turns 38 in June, signed to be Matt Ryan's backup prior to the 2016 season. He has played in seven games over the past three seasons, completing 6 of 10 passes for 36 yards.
Despite some end-of-season speculation that he could retire this offseason, Eagles center Jason Kelce has reached an agreement on a one-year contract extension that ties him to Philadelphia through 2021. According to sources, the extension adds $11 million in new money. Kelce had two years remaining on a seven-year contract he signed in 2014.
Jason Kelce said the Eagles originally approached him about a restructure during the season. He had a difficult year because of injury and, now 31, took some time to ponder future before deciding not to retire. The move gives him a bump in pay and frees up cap space for Eagles.
The Jacksonville Jaguars are attempting to trade running back Carlos Hyde and defensive tackle Malik Jackson, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Hyde was traded to the Jaguars by the Cleveland Browns last season, and he rushed for 189 yards on 58 carries in eight games with Jacksonville. Jackson has been in Jacksonville since 2016 after signing a six-year contract worth up to $90 million. He has totaled 18 sacks over the past three seasons.
The Detroit Lions had to make a potential restricted free-agency decision on defensive end Romeo Okwara. On Friday, the team bypassed all of that, signing him to a new, two-year deal instead. Okwara, 23, was a massive find for Detroit last season after he was claimed off waivers following his release by the Giants during the cutdown churn in September. He started 14 games for the Lions and led the franchise with 7.5 sacks.
Teams that have communicated with the New York Giants are under the impression they are trying to trade outside linebacker Olivier Vernon, sources told ESPN. Vernon is set to make $15.5 million this season. His current deal has two years and $31 million remaining.
Olivier Vernon is a contract from the old regime, when the Giants signed him to play as a defensive end in a 4-3 base. They played a 3-4 more frequently last year, and while Vernon was quietly great to end the season -- he had six sacks and 13 knockdowns over his final five games -- it's not a surprise that the Giants would look to shed his $19.5 million cap hold. They can create $11.5 million by trading or releasing Vernon, and while they'll unquestionably look for a trade partner, the two years and $31 million left on Vernon's deal suggest the latter is more likely to happen.
The Philadelphia Eagles have agreed to terms on a three-year extension with defensive end Brandon Graham, the team announced Friday. The new deal, which will keep Graham with the Eagles through the 2021 season, is worth $40 million, a source told ESPN's Tim McManus.

Jason Witten is returning to the Dallas Cowboys, the team announced Thursday. Witten is leaving ESPN's Monday Night Football and returning to the playing field less than a year after announcing his retirement. Sources told ESPN that the tight end is getting a one-year deal worth $3.5 million that can max out at $5 million, including roster bonuses and incentives.
Archer: What Witten's return means for Cowboys on and off the field
Archer: Jones lauds Witten as coach-in-waiting
After making a stunning return to the NFL, Jason Witten will have a role to play in the Cowboys offense. Dak Prescott ranked 27th in passer rating on throws between the hashes within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage last year. The 36-year-old tight end was last in yards per reception among regular tight ends during the final three seasons of his pro career before retiring, but Witten caught more than 70 percent of his targets over each of those seasons. Witten's one-year, $3.5-million deal gives the Cowboys a safe pair of hands and a very reasonably-paid solution at a position of need for many teams around the NFL.
One year after making a blockbuster trade to move up in the draft, the New York Jets are willing to go in reverse if the price is right. General manager Mike Maccagnan, speaking to reporters Wednesday at the NFL scouting combine, put a ""for sale"" sign on the Jets' pick, third overall.
The Jacksonville Jaguars and Marcell Dareus have agreed to a restructured contract that will keep the nose tackle with the team next season. The deal clears $5 million in cap space for the Jaguars and lowers Dareus' base salary from $8.335 million in 2019, sources told ESPN's Field Yates. Dareus was scheduled to earn a $2 million roster bonus on March 15 but now gets a $5 million bonus immediately. The restructured contract runs through the 2020 season, eliminating the final year of the old contract.
Kicker Robbie Gould, one of the first free agents signed by the San Francisco 49ers when coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch took over in 2017, will be around for at least one more season after he received the team's franchise tag on Tuesday.

The Dallas Cowboys have made their first offer to defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, and executive vice president Stephen Jones is hopeful that a long-term deal can be reached with the Pro Bowl defensive end. ""I'm confident we'll get a deal done,"" Jones said in a break between competition committee meetings in Indianapolis. ""I don't know the timing, but I'm very confident we can get a deal done. Everybody's on the record, from Jerry [Jones] to myself to Jason Garrett to Will [McClay], on what we think of D-Law.""
Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Quinn put to rest speculation about the roster status of pass-rusher Vic Beasley Jr., telling ESPN that keeping Beasley for the 2019 season is ""the plan right now."" ""I'm very excited about where I think he can go to, and we've had good conversations about the impact that he can make,"" Quinn said of Beasley, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft and the 2016 NFL sack champion. ""The biggest impact that he can make is doing it really consistently.""
Greg Robinson has re-signed with the Cleveland Browns, the team announced Monday. His agents had earlier announced a deal had been agreed upon. Terms were not disclosed.

The Chiefs needed defensive ends for their new 4-3 base defensive system and will plug Okafor into one of those spots. He likely will join Breeland Speaks, the Chiefs' second-round pick last year, as a starter.
Okafor, who turned 28 in February, revived his career with the New Orleans Saints over the past two seasons. After suffering a torn Achilles late in the 2017 season, he came back last season to start all 16 games, compiling four sacks, while splitting playing time with rookie first-round draft pick Marcus Davenport.
Before his injury in 2017, Okafor had 4.5 sacks in just 10 games after joining the Saints as a free agent. He played even more of an every-down role that season, showing his strength as both a pass-rusher and run defender.
A fourth-round draft pick (103rd overall) in 2013, Okafor flashed his potential with eight sacks for the Arizona Cardinals in 2014. However, he was mostly stuck in a rotational role during his four seasons with the Cardinals while also battling a series of nagging biceps and toe injuries.
Okafor has 22 sacks in 68 career games.

26243999,"Perriman now will sign a one-year, $4 million deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the source said.
He will help to fill the void left when the Buccaneers lost wide receiver Adam Humphries in free agency when he agreed to sign with the Tennessee Titans.
With Beckham set to join Jarvis Landry in Cleveland, the Browns will have arguably the top one-two receiving tandem in the league.
The Giants can no longer straddle the line of restocking on the fly or trying to compete. They are starting over, even if it's a year too late.
From questions of ""what is going on?"" to claims of ""fake news,"" players are showing their surprise at New York's stunning trade of its star receiver to Cleveland.
The Giants have agreed to trade star receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to the Browns for a package that includes the No. 17 pick in this year's NFL draft, a source confirmed to ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Perriman was on the street when the Browns signed him on Oct. 13 last year following the trade of Josh Gordon to the New England Patriots.
Expectations were low. Perriman, 25, was the No. 26 overall pick in the 2015 draft by the Baltimore Ravens, but he was released in September after training camp. He briefly signed with Washington, but again was released amid his reputation for dropping passes.
Given a chance by the Browns, Perriman took advantage, playing in the final 10 games, including two starts in which he was featured in three-wide receiver sets. As the season went on, he came up with several big plays as he averaged 21.3 yards on 16 receptions. According to ESPN Stats & Information, Perriman did not drop a pass in 2018.
He missed the 2015 season with a partially torn PCL in his right knee. He was sidelined for training camp in 2016 with a partially torn ACL and missed the preseason and one regular-season game in 2017 with various injuries.

26274352,"The Bucs are transitioning to a 3-4 defense under Bruce Arians and Todd Bowles, giving Barrett an opportunity to challenge for playing time along with young players like Noah Spence and Carl Nassib.
He saw just 21 percent of defensive snaps in Denver last season after the emergence of fifth-overall draft pick Bradley Chubb. His 26 tackles were a career low, and his three sacks were the second-lowest season total of his career -- he had 1.5 sacks in 2016.
""I want to go somewhere I can start,"" a frustrated Barrett said after the Broncos' disappointing 6-10 season. ""Or contribute more to a defense.""
Barrett has been known a high-motor player and drew raves from his coaches for his no-nonsense approach, which mirrors Arians. He's also been very durable, having missed just three games in four seasons.
Originally signed as an undrafted free agent out of Colorado State, Barrett spent much of the 2014 season on the Broncos' practice squad. He became a regular in the Broncos' defense at the start of 2015, finishing with a career-best 5.5 sacks as he helped the Broncos to a Super Bowl.
Barrett, who played in 61 games with Denver with 15 starts, has consistently cited his path to the NFL, which included two years at Boys Town in Nebraska after he left Baltimore when he was 15, searching for more structure and discipline.
The Bucs also re-signed defensive tackle Rakeem Nuñez-Roches and cornerback De'Vante Harris to one-year deals.

26055197,"New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft is facing charges of misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution after he was twice videotaped paying for a sex act at an illicit massage parlor, police in Florida said Friday.
The 77-year-old Kraft was one of 25 people involved in the alleged solicitation at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida.
Michael Edmondson, spokesman for the state attorney's office in Palm Beach County, told ESPN that the nature of any charges that the 25 people face will not be released until next week.
Kraft is facing charges of misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution. What will the consequences be for him and the NFL?
The potential charges come amid a widespread crackdown on sex trafficking in Florida from Palm Beach to Orlando. Hundreds of arrest warrants have been issued in recent days as result of a six-month investigation, and more are expected. Ten spas have been closed, and several people charged with sex trafficking have been taken into custody.
Police said they secretly planted undercover cameras in targeted massage parlors and recorded the interactions between men and the female employees.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Kraft said they ""categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity. Because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further.""
The NFL said it is ""aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments.""
The individuals named as having solicited prostitutes could be facing either a first- or second-degree misdemeanor for each count. A second-degree charge carries up to a 60-day jail sentence and a $500 fine; a first-degree charge carries up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
Most people charged for the first time with soliciting a prostitute in Florida are allowed to enter a diversion program, said attorney David Weinstein, a former prosecutor. Kraft would have to perform 100 hours of community service and pay to attend an educational program about the negative effects of prostitution and human trafficking.
Jupiter Police Chief Daniel Kerr said he was shocked to learn Kraft, who is worth $6 billion, was allegedly paying for sex inside a strip-mall massage parlor.
The Patriots' Robert Kraft, who is facing misdemeanor charges of solicitation of a prostitute in Florida, isn't the first owner of a professional sports franchise to be in trouble with the law. A look at some notable others:
Jerry Richardson, Panthers: He sold the NFL team last year after allegations surfaced of sexual and racial misconduct in the workplace. Following a six-month investigation by the NFL, he was fined $2.7 million.
Jimmy Haslam, Browns: He had legal troubles while CEO of Pilot Flying J, one of the nation's largest truck-stop chains. Company executives either pleaded guilty or were convicted in a fraud scheme worth more than $50 million. Haslam said he didn't know about the scheme in which customers were underpaid on promised rebates for fuel purchases, and he was not charged. The NFL never disciplined him.
Jim Irsay, Colts: He was arrested in 2014 and held overnight after he failed sobriety tests and police found prescription medications in his car. He was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated, along with four felony counts of possession of a controlled substance; police also found $29,009 in cash. He again sought treatment and in September 2014 pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of driving while intoxicated, agreeing to undergo drug testing for a year. Irsay also admitted he was under the influence of the painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone when he was arrested. The NFL suspended Irsay for six games and fined him $500,000.
Ed DeBartolo Jr., 49ers: In 1998, he pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony when he paid $400,000 to former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards in exchange for a riverboat gambling license. DeBartolo was suspended from the NFL for one year in 1999 for his role in the gambling fraud scandal. He also handed over control of the team to his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, and never returned to the 49ers.
Leonard Tose, Eagles: He had to sell the team in 1985 to pay off more than $25 million in debts to Atlantic City casinos.
Marge Schott, Reds: She was sued by former employees during the days of the Big Red Machine for being a racist and, at one point, was quoted in The New York Times as saying Adolf Hitler initially was good for Germany, that her use of racially inappropriate words was in jest and that she didn't understand why certain ethnically insulting words were offensive. In 1993, Schott was suspended for one year by MLB and fined $25,000 for ""racially and ethnically offensive"" language.
Donald Sterling, Clippers: He was fined $2.5 million and banned from the NBA for life in 2014 for racist comments he made to a friend.
Rigas family, Sabres: It was forced to relinquish control of the team after indictments on bank and security fraud charges for raiding the coffers of its cable company, Adelphia. The Sabres played the 2003-04 season under NHL operation before being purchased out of bankruptcy by Thomas Golisano.
Brian France, NASCAR: He was arrested in New York last year on charges of aggravated driving while intoxicated and criminal possession of a controlled substance. He immediately took a leave of absence, and his uncle, Jim France, stepped in as chairman and CEO.
George Steinbrenner, Yankees: A 15-count indictment was handed up in 1974 in Cleveland federal court for violations of election laws. Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to make illegal campaign contributions then was suspended by commissioner Bowie Kuhn for two years. That suspension was lifted after 15 months for good behavior.

""We are as equally stunned as everyone else,"" Kerr said.
Kraft lives in Massachusetts and has a home in the Palm Beach area. He is a frequent guest of President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago Club. Though a Democrat, Kraft is friendly with Trump.
""Well it's very sad. I was very surprised to see it,"" Trump said at the White House on Friday. ""He's proclaimed his innocence, totally. But I'm very surprised to see it.''
Kraft's wife, Myra Hiatt Kraft, died in 2011. He has been dating 39-year-old actress Ricki Noel Lander since 2012.
Team owners are subject to the NFL's personal conduct policy, and owners and league employees are held to an even higher standard than players. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay was suspended for six games in 2014 after he was arrested on drug charges. He was also fined $500,000.
Vero Beach Police Chief David Currey, whose agency has been involved in the investigation, told reporters earlier this week that the prostitutes are victims who have been trapped into the trade.
""These girls are there all day long, into the evening. They can't leave, and they are performing sex acts,"" Currey said, according to TCPalm. ""Some of them may tell us they're OK, but they're not.""
Kraft, who made his initial fortune through a packaging company, was a Patriots season-ticket holder when he purchased the team's previous stadium in 1988 then used his leverage to buy the team for $172 million in 1994 to keep it from moving to St. Louis.
He hired Bill Belichick to be his coach in 2000, and the team subsequently drafted quarterback Tom Brady, launching nearly two decades of success.
Under Kraft, who also owns Major League Soccer's New England Revolution, the Patriots have been the most successful team in pro sports, having made it to 10 Super Bowls, winning six, including this year against the Los Angeles Rams.
But there also have been issues involving team actions under Belichick.
In 2007, the Patriots were caught filming signals from New York Jets coaches; New England was suspected of doing so against other teams as well, and that was confirmed later on. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell fined the Patriots $250,000 and stripped them of their 2008 first-round draft pick. Belichick was fined $500,000, the most an NFL coach ever was fined.
In the 2014 AFC Championship Game, the team -- specifically Brady -- was accused by the Colts of doctoring footballs.
The NFL concluded that Patriots employees were involved in deflating the footballs and Brady was ""at least generally aware"" it was being done. After lengthy legal battles, Brady served a four-game suspension at the beginning of the 2016 season and the Patriots were fined $1 million -- the heftiest for a team in league history. New England was stripped of a first-round and a fourth-round draft choice.
Neither Kraft nor Belichick was implicated after the investigation.
Longtime Patriots captain Devin McCourty told NBC Boston, which is with him on a goodwill trip to Puerto Rico, of the Kraft news: ""When you see things come out like that, you really have to just let it play out. See what it is, what it isn't, and go from there.""

26237211,"On Monday, Suggs told members of the Ravens that he was moving on, a source told ESPN. One of the top leaders and characters in franchise history, he had spent his entire 16-year NFL career in Baltimore.
Leading tackler C.J. Mosley is leaving the Ravens for a five-year, $85 million deal from the Jets, sources confirmed to ESPN.
The Packers added two pass-rushers in Za'Darius Smith and Preston Smith, plus safety Adrian Amos, sources told ESPN.
The departure of Suggs, 36, continues what could be a major turnover for the NFL's top-ranked defense. Safety Eric Weddle was cut and signed with the Los Angeles Rams last week, middle linebacker C.J. Mosley agreed to an $85 million deal with the New York Jets and fellow linebacker Za'Darius Smith agreed to a deal with the Green Bay Packers on Tuesday.
Throughout his career, Suggs expressed a desire to join Jonathan Ogden and Ray Lewis as players who were ""Ravens for life."" Instead, Suggs will finish out his career elsewhere like Ed Reed and Haloti Ngata.
Suggs is one of the most accomplished pass-rushers in NFL history, ranking first among active players with 132.5 sacks and tying Lawrence Taylor and Leslie O'Neal for 13th all time. Even though he's not the same consistent force, he finished second on the NFL's top-ranked defense in sacks with seven last season.

The big question is how much Suggs has left. His 34 total tackles in 2018 were his fewest in a full season since his 2003 rookie season, and he managed 1.5 sacks in his final 10 games last season (including the playoff loss to the Chargers).
Suggs has been one of the best players in Ravens history. The 10th overall pick of the 2003 draft, he is the franchise's all-time leader in sacks and forced fumbles (35) and ranks second in total tackles (844) and fumble recoveries (14).

Everybody's on the record, from Jerry [Jones] to myself to Jason Garrett to Will [McClay], on what we think of D-Law.""
Cowboys DE Randy Gregory, who missed all of the 2017 season, has been suspended indefinitely by the NFL for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy for a fourth time.
The NFL is evaluating Cowboys defensive tackle David Irving for a potential suspension, league sources told ESPN.
Successful drafts are not judged solely by a selection among the first 32, but by the prospect gems who are uncovered in the mid- to late rounds.
The Cowboys have until March 5 to get a multiyear deal done with Lawrence before having to use the franchise tag. They will meet with Lawrence's agent, David Canter, later this week during the NFL scouting combine.
""It's the last day you've got to tag him, but at the end of the day, we know it's not over if it doesn't get done by then. I hate to put deadlines on anything,"" Stephen Jones said. ""Would we like to get it done? I'd like to have it done yesterday. We've just got to continue to work.""
If the Cowboys use the tag on Lawrence for a second straight year, there is a real threat he will not show up for the offseason program, organized team activities, minicamp or training camp and could miss regular-season games. He made $17.1 million on the tag last season and earned a second straight Pro Bowl appearance, with 10.5 sacks.
Jones would not comment on the threat of Lawrence skipping out on the work.
Without a deal in place by March 5, the Cowboys will tag Lawrence at a cost of $20.5 million, but the hope is that it would serve as a placeholder as talks continued. They would need to get a multiyear offer done by July 15 or Lawrence would be forced to play on the tag in 2019.
In 2015, the Cowboys put the franchise tag on wide receiver Dez Bryant, who missed almost all of the offseason work before signing a five-year, $70 million deal moments before the July deadline.
""Hopefully we'll have some very thoughtful and meaningful conversations and make some progress,"" Jones said.

During his first year at Penn, he worked night shift as a stock boy at Walmart. Then came internships at UBS and an NFL offseason job as a data analyst at Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers on Wall Street. He opened a real estate company last year.
Copeland did all that while playing full time in the NFL, where he's coming off the best season of his career. As a result, students listen when he explains the difference between traditional 401Ks and Roth IRAs, what a 403B is and varying tax rates.
In this class, he isn't interested in the complicated formulas he learned as an undergrad. He's trying to impart knowledge that students will need to make intelligent decisions when they get their first jobs, buy their first cars and find their first homes.
The way Copeland teaches is different than how your average professor teaches, but your average professor hasn't made more than $2.86 million in the NFL. Not that Copeland's students necessarily care. They see the authentic passion he brings. He's raw. He's open.
He doesn't just teach the class; he's an active participant in discussions and sometimes an oversharer -- like when he told them that he used a photo of Kim Kardashian as motivation in high school. A few years ago, he was one of them, sitting in lectures and getting ready for adulthood. He knows what they are experiencing, and he understands what they are about to go through.
""I was kind of shocked how good of a professor he was,"" sophomore Mark Jackson said. ""I didn't go in with any expectations, but he's a very, very smart guy, and you can just tell it by listening to him. He knows what he's talking about, and he's obviously willing to learn.
""He's not going to say he knows things that he doesn't, but at the same time, he really knows a lot.""
Copeland's ability to engage others has always been a strength. It makes it easy for him to navigate a locker room or a board room. It's one of the things Peterson was most concerned with -- and relieved by. Copeland knows he isn't an expert. He admits that to the class. He says if he doesn't know something, they'll research and learn it together.
As much as possible, he emphasizes that in finance, the right decision for one person can be the wrong one for another.
""The point of this class isn't for me to tell you how to spend your money,"" Copeland tells his class. ""It's for you to understand what spending your money is doing for you.""
The idea of the class started two years ago, when Copeland drove around Detroit with two Lions teammates looking at potential real estate investments. As they did, they shared their financial and fiscal responsibility experiences.
Lamenting what they learned and didn't learn in college, one of his teammates said he would have loved to take a class that walked him through the financial information he knows now and wished he knew then: taxes, budgets, investing, retirement plans, renting versus buying homes, leasing versus purchasing cars.
It would have saved him a lot of mistakes in his early 20s.
""He's saying this,"" Copeland said, ""and I'm like, 'That's a class that everybody should have.' Like, it doesn't just involve the players. How is your school going to pick out, 'You're going to the NFL, you're going to the NFL, so this is for you'?
""Like, that's a class that everybody should have. Just because we're players, he wasn't saying it in a negative way -- he was just wishing all the money and time he wasted, if he was better prepared, he would do that.""
The day ended. The idea stuck. Already well-versed in finance, Copeland realized an opportunity and a way to give back to the place that did so much for him, a way to make sure those who come after him don't make the same mistakes as their predecessors.
He brought the idea to Penn and didn't initially get approved. Last May, he ran into Peterson during his five-year reunion at a Penn Black Alumni Society function. They met when Copeland was an undergrad through friends who took classes with him.
Copeland explained his idea for the class and some of the struggles he had launching it. As he talked, Peterson's mind spun. He had contemplated a similar thing and heard stories similar to Copeland's.
""A lot of people just don't have these conversations,"" Peterson said. ""So that was something where, when I put all these pieces together, let's put something on paper. Just workshopping it and figure out where we can go.""
The next day, Peterson shared an extensive Google document of ideas with Copeland. The conversations began -- first weekly, then daily. Peterson asked Ivy Sole, a student who also knew Copeland, to assist in creating the class.
The three built the class. Peterson didn't have time to construct the curriculum. Copeland, a neophyte professor, didn't have the academic background. It became Sole's responsibility to construct the syllabus based on the input and ideas of the two co-professors.
This went on last spring and summer until Copeland left for training camp. They went over each session and what information was too basic or advanced for what they were trying to do.
They didn't know if it was going to happen, despite their relentless positivity. But in October, Peterson figured out a way. He added an inequities aspect, linking social issues and social justice with the concepts of financial literacy. It was a pairing neither Copeland nor Peterson initially thought of, but they realized it meshed well.
After that, Peterson presented their plan to the Urban Studies department at Penn. In October, days before the class book for the spring semester came out, the course was approved as a full-credit pilot program.
Peterson texted Copeland, who responded with gif after gif and meme after meme: fireworks exploding, kids dancing -- so many in a row that Peterson laughed and told him to stop.
Copeland was in the middle of a 35-tackle, five-sack season. The class gave him another major off-the-field accomplishment.
It was the first day of class, and Copeland was nervous. Being in front of a room full of students was stressful for a first-time teacher who, even though he doesn't come off as such, is uncomfortable speaking in public.
He didn't know if the students would relate to him or if he'd die at the front of the room like a bad stand-up comic on stage. He's always confident, but here he questioned everything. What if he didn't know the material well enough? Would his icebreaker jokes go over? What if the course wasn't the unique experience he hoped?
Ten years ago, as a Penn student, he couldn't have imagined being up here, in front of students, lecturing. Yet here he was about to go in. He put on his headphones, with J. Cole and Meek Mill coursing through his body. It was a mode that felt familiar: competition, like fall Sundays.
""That was like going into a game, actually,"" Copeland said. ""The nervous butterflies of how you have this dream, this experiment. It was like my first camp. Like, this is my baby. I think people on the outside don't understand how much time, energy and effort. Like, this is my thing.""
He's spending seven to 10 hours per week putting together his slides, running through his presentations and collaborating on ideas for larger group projects, including hopefully having his students go to middle schools and high schools in Philadelphia to teach the material they've learned during the semester.
Copeland is involved in every aspect of what's going on: checking every email, logging into the university's class portal to communicate with students and reading their essays. He is the one communicating with Peterson, Sole and teaching assistant Leslie Hicks daily about everything. They even built in a strategy so Copeland can keep teaching when he signs with a team, given that he could be around the corner or across the country.
The first class, he asked his students what careers they wanted to have. Then they looked up the average salary for those professions and started working with a budget template that he based on what rookies in the NFL receive. They could input numbers to understand how much of that average salary they would likely earn.
By the end, the nerves dissipated. He felt like a professor, like he belonged.
""We literally walked through it,"" Copeland said. ""That was throwing in cold water for a lot of people in the class. It is about what I'm teaching -- that's important -- but it's also about how I'm teaching it.""
Copeland is the one who came up with the part of every class called ""Who Are You?"" in which students have to stand up and talk for two to five minutes to someone in the class they don't know. It's a way to foster better class conversation -- and teach students how to network in social situations, a crucial business and life skill. Copeland considers the classroom a safe space where every idea is welcomed and every experience is heard. Together, they all grow.

Even though they are co-teaching, Peterson says Copeland is the lead instructor. He's the one who starts each class, teaching for around 90 minutes before Peterson teaches for about 70.
""Brandon is the reason why this class exists. Brandon is the reason why this class is being taught, because he is the one teaching it,"" Sole said. ""Brandon had the idea. Brandon found the right people to support him to execute his vision.
""Brandon is currently living out the vision in the form of teaching the class.""
Copeland doesn't really want to teach. He has no interest in becoming a tenured-track professor at Penn or anywhere, though he's already excited about bringing the class back to Penn next spring (it is not an option in the fall semester because of football).
He views this class -- and what he's teaching -- as part of a larger plan. Most of his off-the-field pursuits have been similar, from his businesses to his foundation to his football camps. As part of the camp, participants load backpacks full of school supplies for kids in Baltimore, and the camp, unbeknownst to the kids, is partially worked by police officers to help foster better relationships between the city's police department and its residents.
For Copeland, all of this is about giving back and getting the knowledge out. He jokes that ""we're trying to build an empire."" The class is just one part of that -- and even then, he'd love to see the concept grow to more schools on more grade levels.
""The goal for me is to make this information accessible to everyone, some way or somehow,"" he said. ""And then, long term, hopefully that actually shrinks the wealth gap. So that might sound outrageous, but I don't care. It's outrageous to make it to the NFL, right? So you know, again, that's the long game.
""The long game is to get this information in as many hands as possible, and this is Brandon Copeland's way of helping the world.""
One mind, one semester, one city at a time.

26236672,"""I'm excited about it,"" Bennett said Monday during an appearance at Princeton University's Richardson Auditorium.
Bennett, who was scheduled to take a physical with the Patriots in Boston on Tuesday, said he looked forward to being coached by Bill Belichick and playing on a team led by Tom Brady.
""From a football perspective there's a respect for Belichick,"" Bennett said. ""I consider him the Yoda of football when it comes to the ins and outs of what's happening around how to prepare for a game.""
Defensive end Michael Bennett told ESPN the Eagles have informed him that they are planning to trade him to the Patriots. His brother, tight end Martellus Bennett, is contemplating coming out of retirement, a source said.
As for leaving the Eagles after a season and joining what many fans consider the NFL's Evil Empire, Bennett said he embraces the change.
""The Patriots are a team that people love to hate because they always win,"" he said. ""The opportunity to learn from that and be in that environment is good.""
Bennett said the trade to New England initially surprised him. He was one of a core of NFL players who followed Colin Kaepernick's lead beginning in 2016 and protested during the playing of the national anthem.
The protest agitated many fans and drew the ire of President Donald Trump, who condemned the protesting players and suggested they should be fired.
Belichick and Brady are enthusiastic supporters of the president. In meetings with Patriots executives, Bennett said he would continue to remain in the locker room during the playing of the anthem.
""I explained to them that my integrity means everything,"" Bennett said. ""I think they respect that about me, they respect who I am as an individual.""
He added: ""The Patriots have been trying to trade for me for two years. Last year they tried to get me, the year before they tried to get me.""
Now they have him.
Bennett would neither deny nor confirm that his younger brother, Martellus, would also join the Patriots. ""I'd love to play with my brother but I don't want to be the force that forces my brother to play because I'm playing on the team,"" he said. ""I want him to play purely because he wants to play.

""The game is played a lot better when you truly want to play because you want to play. It's important, if he decides to come back, that's the first thing he should think about. As a brother that's my ultimate goal to see him happy, and whatever happiness looks for him, that's what I wanted.""
He said he was looking forward to engaging Belichick and Brady about their support of a president who is largely viewed to be hostile to the interests of people of color.
""I think it's important not to to run away from those conversations, or not hear their ideas about why they think the way they do,"" he said.
""I think it's an opportunity for growth to have those conversations,"" he added. ""If we don't allow ourselves to have those conversations, we're stunting our growth.""
Bennett was a major defensive contributor to the Seattle Seahawks' Super Bowl championship in 2013. Last March, he was traded to the Eagles. ""I'm the same person, it's just that my voice is being heard more,"" Bennett said.
Bennett is the author of ""Things That Make White People Uncomfortable."" How will the Patriots fan base respond to what Bennett does on the field and says away from it?
""Those conversations will present themselves,"" Bennett said. ""I think it's going to be really unique.""

26033184,"MINNEAPOLIS -- In past offseasons, the Minnesota Vikings have doled out contract extensions to a handful of players ahead of when their current deals were set to expire. It's the way the franchise rewarded the likes of Eric Kendricks, Danielle Hunter and Stefon Diggs during the 2018 offseason.
Another Viking who could be in line for an extension this offseason is Adam Thielen. The wide receiver signed a four-year deal worth $19.246 million in 2017, which will earn him around $8 million next season.
So long, 2018 season. It's never too early to look ahead to 2019. Our crew of insiders weighs in on the biggest topics of the offseason.
Which teams will undergo the most roster and coaching turnover this offseason? Let's run through every eliminated team from 1-32.
Speaking on SKOR North, an ESPN radio affiliate in the Twin Cities, Thielen's agent, Blake Baratz, indicated a belief that an extension for the two-time Pro Bowl receiver could be reached this offseason and that it wouldn't come via a holdout by Thielen if both parties couldn't come to an agreement.
""Adam's not that type of person,"" Baratz said of the receiver holding out. ""I would never condone a player to hold out or be disruptive if it wasn't for a very valid reason, and [what's not] a valid reason, to me, is both sides working in good faith to come to a conclusion that makes sense for everybody.""
Thielen's record-breaking season and career highs in catches (113), yards (1,373) and touchdowns (9) have lead many, including his representation, to believe he has outplayed his current contract.
""This team has a lot of really good things in place for it, and I know they want to take care of Adam and I know they want Adam there and I know they want to reward Adam,"" Baratz said. ""What exactly that looks like and when that happens, I can't speak to yet, but I'm cautiously optimistic that everyone will come around and do the right thing. There's not -- no one's being greedy. Everyone understands the situation and it's really in their court. He has a couple of years left on his deal but he's earned a significant pay raise. Not to mention what he's done on the field, he might be one of the best people in the entire National Football League and represents the city and the organization and state and frankly, the entire region unbelievably.""
Added Baratz: ""We're all hopeful that it'll get done.""
At the start of last training camp, Diggs inked a five-year deal worth $72 million with a $15 million signing bonus. While it isn't clear whether those figures are what Thielen and his representation are eyeing, a similar deal would put the 28-year-old receiver among the top 10 highest paid at his position.
""In a perfect world, we'd like to get something done,"" Baratz said. ""We're going to sit down here and have conversations in these coming weeks and we'll see where that leads us. I think everyone knows that Adam deserves a new contract. It's not as simple as just doing a high-level extension in a vacuum. There's other pieces and the Vikings have done a phenomenal job of managing their salary cap. Rob Brzezinski is one of the best in the game at what he does. It's not just 'How do we reward Adam Thielen?' It's how do we put our 53-man roster together that also allows for us to have continued success into the future. And I understand that. I have a job to do and Rob and Rick and the Vikings have a job to do, and we respect what each other does. It doesn't mean we always have to agree, but we respect what each other has to do as our profession.""

26265727,"Terms were not disclosed, but NFL Network reported the deal is worth $15 million.
The move comes after Drew Brees restructured his contract to create more than $10 million in salary-cap space for the Saints.
The Saints restructured Drew Brees' contract on Thursday, creating more than $10 million in needed salary-cap space.
Brown becomes the latest Patriots player to depart the Super Bowl champions in free agency, joining defensive end Trey Flowers (Detroit Lions), left tackle Trent Brown (Oakland Raiders) and wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson (Chicago Bears).
Saints starting nose tackle Tyeler Davison is an unrestricted free agent and the team has depth concerns at their other defensive tackle spot, with starter Sheldon Rankins recovering from a torn Achilles and backup David Onyemata facing potential discipline for a marijuana possession charge.
The Patriots selected Malcom Brown in the first round of the 2015 draft, with the final pick of the round (No. 32). They declined his fifth-year option for the 2019 season, which would have kept him under contract for a base salary of about $8 million.

In his four seasons in New England, Brown appeared in 60 regular-season games (51 starts). Playing mostly on early downs, the 6-foot-2, 320-pound University of Texas alum was credited with 186 tackles and totaled 8.5 sacks.
In 11 playoff games, he totaled 33 tackles and one sack.
Brown, who turned 25 in February, often was asked to play a two-gap style for the Patriots in which the primary goal was to hold up blockers to allow those behind him to make plays. That was a change for him coming from Texas, where he started 26 of 39 games over three years and finished with 165 tackles and 8.5 sacks. He had 29 tackles for a loss for the Longhorns.

26174723,"The Denver Broncos have agreed to trade quarterback Case Keenum to the Washington Redskins for a sixth-round pick in the 2020 draft, sources confirmed to ESPN's Adam Schefter on Thursday. Washington will also get a 2020 seventh-rounder from Denver.
Keenum, who was currently slated to count $21 million against the Broncos' salary cap for the 2019 season, has reworked his contract and will be on a one-year deal with the Redskins, sources told Schefter.
Keenum, 31, has a base salary of $18 million this season, but only $7 million was guaranteed in the way of offsets, which the Redskins and Broncos decided to split evenly, sources said. The Broncos, who would've carried $10 million in ""dead money"" had they cut Keenum, will instead save $3 million by paying only $3.5 million as well as a $500,000 restructuring bonus.
Jay Gruden and the Redskins can exhale after adding veteran depth, but the trade doesn't mean they won't be on the prowl for a QB to develop.
Which teams will go after Le'Veon Bell or be the most aggressive when the market opens next week? NFL Nation breaks down what to expect from every team.
The Broncos signed Keenum to a two-year, $36 million deal in March 2018 to be their starting quarterback. Denver then went 6-10 in 2018, which led to the dismissal of head coach Vance Joseph and the hiring of Vic Fangio to replace him.
Since the end of the season, the Broncos have put in place the framework of a trade to acquire veteran Joe Flacco from the Baltimore Ravens. Keenum said at the time he was ""shocked"" and ""disappointed"" by that news.
Neither the Broncos nor the Ravens, or even Flacco, can formally acknowledge the trade until the start of the new league year Wednesday, when the deal can be filed to the NFL.
The Redskins, meanwhile, are facing an uncertain future with quarterback Alex Smith, who suffered a compound fracture in his right leg last season that required multiple surgeries because of infections.
Smith is considered a long shot to play in 2019; the Redskins still haven't said whether he will play.
""That's hard; this is new to everybody,"" Redskins coach Jay Gruden said of Smith at the NFL scouting combine. ""This is an injury that's tough to overcome, but you also don't know Alex and what he can do with his mind and what he can overcome. Will he be ready next year or the year after? I don't know. We'll play it by ear.""

The only other quarterback on the Redskins' roster is Colt McCoy, whose cap hit is $3.375 million for 2019. However, multiple people in the organization believe McCoy could help them win.
Washington had been mentioned as a possible destination for Josh Rosen if the Arizona Cardinals decide to draft Kyler Murray with the No. 1 overall pick.
Behind a battered Denver offensive line -- three starters were placed on injured reserve -- Keenum was inconsistent, as was the Broncos' offense as a whole. He finished with 3,890 passing yards and 18 touchdowns. He threw 15 interceptions, tied for the second most in the league.
Keenum finished among the bottom 10 in the NFL in Total QBR.
""We don't know what's going to happen,"" Keenum said Feb. 21 about his future. ""There's still a lot up in the air; this is very fresh. So a lot of these emotions that we're talking about are still kind of going on, still happening. So who knows what's going to be in store. I don't for sure; God does. But we'll be ready for whatever God has in store for us next.""
Keenum starred for the Minnesota Vikings in 2017, helping them reach the NFC Championship Game. In 14 starts, he threw for 3,547 yards, 22 touchdowns and seven interceptions.
Gruden and Vikings coach Mike Zimmer know each other well from coaching together in Cincinnati, giving the Redskins' coach an outlet for good insight on Keenum.
The Redskins could still look for another quarterback in the middle rounds of the draft. They would like to add a playmaker on offense and have been mentioned as a possible trade destination for Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Antonio Brown.
By adding Keenum at a reasonable price, they can still make a move involving one of their high draft picks and can create more cap room by, among other things, cutting linebacker Zach Brown or defensive end Stacy McGee. That would free up nearly $9 million. Restructured deals or contract extensions for others could free up more.
The NFL Network first reported that the teams were working on a trade.

According to NFL Next Gen Stats, Darby allowed 6.0 yards per attempt as the nearest defender in coverage in 2018. That ranked ninth out of 46 defensive backs with at least 70 targets.
Darby, who turned 25 in January, was acquired by Philly from the Buffalo Bills for receiver Jordan Matthews and a third-round pick in August 2017.
The Florida State product ran a sub-4.4-second 40-yard dash at the scouting combine and has undeniable athleticism. He has 54 passes defensed and six interceptions in 46 career games.

26275525,"Tate said Friday after signing a lucrative new contract with the Giants that the team is ""not as far off as people think."" Part of that is a belief that there are good players on the roster.
The Giants have sent mixed signals in recent days with their actions and words. They traded Beckham and Vernon to the Browns and allowed Collins to leave via free agency. Collins signed a record deal for a safety with the Washington Redskins.
General manager Dave Gettleman said in a statement to announce the trades that the Giants aren't tearing it down with their eyes completely on the future.
""You can win while you build a roster,"" Gettleman said. ""We do have a plan, and this is a part of it.""
The Giants agreed to a deal with Tate some 24 hours later. It's for four years and $37.5 million with $23 million guaranteed.
New York will be Tate's fourth stop. He started his career in Seattle, taken in the second round of the 2010 draft, and then signed as a free agent in Detroit before the 2014 season. He was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles midway through last season.
The seasoned veteran, who said he grew up a Giants fan and admired their history, isn't exactly a young building block. He turns 31 this summer.
Tate joins a Giants team that went 5-11 last season in Pat Shurmur's first year as the head coach. They have won just eight games the past two seasons combined. Only the Cleveland Browns have won fewer games over that same time span.
It's not stopping Tate from thinking the Giants can do some immediate damage.
""I really believe that you can win games while you build,"" Tate said. ""And we have a great division that is set up for us to do some great things in. Just really kind of excited to play. I think we have some very important key, good pieces in this locker room that I'm anxious to learn more about. It starts with, we have a really good quarterback, I believe. We have a really good running back and ample other really, really good players. We just need to build that camaraderie and play as a team, day in and day out, week in and week out, play by play.
""I just believe if we can get this team to be on the same page all the time, we're going to win games, and we're going to build as we go. I feel every team in the NFL is building to an extent.""

26263506,"Brees, 40, will still earn $23 million in salary and bonuses this year, and he is still scheduled to become a free agent after this season.
Free-agent quarterback Teddy Bridgewater met with the Dolphins on Wednesday night. Bridgewater will have to decide between joining Miami or re-signing with New Orleans.
But as the NFL Network first reported, his 2019 cap hit will drop from a league-high $33.5 million to $22.7 million. The catch is that the Saints will now have to account for a total of $21.3 million in ""dead money"" against the salary cap after Brees is done playing instead of just $10.5 million in dead money.
The Saints entered this offseason with somewhere between $4 million and $10 million in cap space. And they'll need more if they're able to land some of the big fishes they're still considering in free agency -- including Brees' potential successor,  Teddy Bridgewater.
The Saints and Miami Dolphins are competing for Bridgewater's services after the 26-year-old quarterback visited Miami on Wednesday. The Saints also have visits scheduled with the top tight end on the market, Jared Cook, elite pass rusher Ezekiel Ansah and defensive lineman Mario Edwards, according to sources.

To carve out the additional cap space in Brees' deal, the Saints added a automatically voiding year to the end of his contract in 2021 (they already had an automatically voiding year on the deal for 2020). And they converted part of his 2019 base salary and roster bonus into a signing bonus.
The Saints have been operating this way with their salary-cap accounting for years because they have essentially been in ""win-now"" mode during Brees' Hall of Fame career. The thinking is that they can catch up whenever he is done playing -- though that will be harder to do in the near future, with so many young stars approaching the end of their rookie contracts. Receiver Michael Thomas, in particular, is in the final year of his deal and will likely seek close to $20 million per year in his next one.
So far this offseason, the Saints have signed veteran backup running back Latavius Murray as a slightly cheaper alternative to Mark Ingram, who left for the Baltimore Ravens. They also re-signed restricted free agent kicker Wil Lutz to one of the richest kicker contracts in NFL history and re-signed core special-teams players Craig Robertson and Chris Banjo.

26153530,"After a number of offseason moves didn't work out last year, the Broncos have to be creative with cap money and nail these moves.
John Elway has two veteran QBs and no long-term scenario at the position, but taking someone like Dwayne Haskins might not fit the Broncos' plans.
The Broncos, in need of salary-cap space before free agency opens March 13, released safety Darian Stewart on Thursday. Stewart, who had two years remaining on his four-year extension through 2020, was slated to count $6.37 million against the salary cap in 2019.
With Bradley Roby also set to depart via free agency, cornerback Chris Harris Jr. will be the lone player remaining from a secondary that led the league in pass defense in back-to-back seasons and helped power the team to a Super Bowl 50 win.
Safety T.J. Ward was released in 2017, and Aqib Talib was traded before the 2018 season.
Stewart took to social media Wednesday to formally announce the move.
 Broncos country thank you all for the love you showed me and my family these past 4 years. But it's time for me to move on and I'm looking forward to the next chapter. I still got a whole lotta 🏈 left in me so I'll see y'all real soon.

Once the trade with the Ravens for quarterback Joe Flacco becomes official on March 13 and his $18.5 million salary is on the books, the Broncos will have about $17 million to $18 million worth of cap space then. They could turn base salaries into signing bonuses with some of their more highly paid players to create some room, but they will have to make roster moves -- and take on more ""dead money"" than they've carried in seasons past -- to be as active in free agency as they'd like to be.
Broncos president of football operations/general manager John Elway said at the NFL scouting combine that the team didn't have enough room to do what he wanted in free agency.
""No. What I want to do? There's a lot of things that I would ... we have enough to help our football team, which is the goal. But that's not exactly everything I would like to do,"" Elway said. ""I still think that we can be effective and get better.''

Stewart is the second veteran player on defense to be informed in recent weeks that he would not be retained. Linebacker Brandon Marshall also was told not to expect the team to pay an option bonus in the coming days, so he will be an unrestricted free agent as well.
With the Broncos finishing 5-11 and 6-10 over the past two seasons, Harris had predicted that ""every veteran is on a non-guaranteed deal.""
In recent weeks, Stewart had hoped to ""get some clarity'' on the direction of the new coaching staff, including head coach Vic Fangio and defensive coordinator Ed Donatell.
Stewart originally signed with the Broncos in 2015 and missed just three games in those four years. A respected voice in the locker room, Stewart had at least 56 tackles each season and finished with nine interceptions.
There is a long list of safeties available in free agency, including Adrian Amos, who played for Fangio with the Chicago Bears. But if the Broncos fill Stewart's job from within, the most likely candidate to play alongside Justin Simmons would be Will Parks.

26275527,"On Friday, Rath's attorney, Vicki Podberesky, entered a plea of not guilty on Rath's behalf at Ventura County Superior Court.
Rath, 35, was arrested Jan. 15 on suspicion of sexual battery, stemming from an incident in Moorpark, California (approximately 10 miles from the team's practice headquarters), on June 15, 2018, according to a press release from the Ventura County District Attorney's office.
The Rams placed Rath on leave following his arrest. Rath did not coach in the NFC Championship Game in New Orleans or in Super Bowl LIII against the New England Patriots in Atlanta.
""We are aware of the charges filed against Ted Rath,"" the Rams said in a statement Friday. ""We take these allegations very seriously. Once the charges were filed, we decided Ted would take a leave of absence from the team as this matter works its way through the justice system.""
During the week of the Super Bowl in February, NFL.com reported that Rath would not be in attendance because of a medical procedure. Rath had recently risen to moderate fame because of a viral video that promoted his role as Rams coach Sean McVay's ""get-back coach,"" tasked with keeping McVay from entering the playing field during games. ""We love him,"" McVay told NFL.com days before the Super Bowl. ""I know the players and coaches miss him when he's not here with us, but he's with us in spirit. He's done a great job of helping us get to this point and he knows that.""
On Friday, a Rams spokesperson confirmed that Rath underwent a medical procedure during his leave.
According to the press release from the district attorney's office, the charges allege that Rath ""touched an adult woman against her will on intimate parts of her body for the purpose of sexual arousal and gratification"" at a private residence in Moorpark.
Podberesky issued the following statement on behalf of her client: ""Mr. Rath takes these allegations very seriously. Ted is a man who has led a law-abiding life. He is a husband, a father and a dedicated family man. He has the utmost respect for women and would never intentionally act in a manner that was demeaning or otherwise inappropriate. We intend to defend this matter to the fullest extent possible in a court of law, and we believe that after there has been a full vetting of the facts of this case Mr. Rath will be shown to be not guilty of these charges.""
If convicted on all three counts, Rath could face a maximum sentence of 18 months in jail and would be required to register as a sex offender.
Rath has coached for 10 seasons in the NFL. He joined the Rams as their director of strength and performance last season following stints with the Miami Dolphins and Detroit Lions.

26127741,"It can be commonplace for players to have such surgeries after the season, as it accelerates their timelines to potentially be ready for the offseason program and other activities. Flowers' timeline, compared to most others around the NFL, was condensed after the Patriots' season ended Feb. 3 with the Super Bowl LIII win.
Flowers, 25, played in 15 regular-season games and all three postseason games last season. The one game he missed was due to a concussion.
With five coaches departing, New England's head coach might shift Joe Judge from special teams to offense as he puts together his group for 2019.
The 6-foot-2, 265-pound Flowers has led the Patriots in sacks each of the past three seasons, with his 7.5 in 2018 a career high.
In 46 regular-season games, he has totaled 164 tackles with 21 sacks and five forced fumbles. In nine playoff games, he amassed 39 tackles and 5.5 sacks.
Flowers' versatility is one of the reasons he is expected to be a coveted free agent.
""Trey is one of the hardest-working guys on the team -- running game, passing game, his physical development and maintenance in terms of getting treatment and taking care of himself,"" coach Bill Belichick said in November. ""A lot of times, he's playing inside. At his size, he's just lighter than a lot of guys that play in there over the guard and that position, so he does a good job of being able to hold up -- the techniques of playing inside, playing outside, playing on the open side, playing on the tight end side. He's a very versatile and valuable player for us.""
Flowers played just four snaps in his rookie season, in part due to a shoulder injury, but also as a result of the team's depth at the position. He was ultimately played on injured reserve in December of that season.
By ending his season early, Flowers got a head start on his rehabilitation, which Belichick later said was an important decision from a timing perspective. Flowers then worked his way into a four-man rotation, playing 54 percent of the defensive snaps in 2016, followed by 75 percent in 2017 and 70 percent in 2018.

The Patriots officially announced the acquisition of the 33-year-old Bennett on Thursday, although terms of the trade had been agreed upon late last week. The Patriots get Bennett and a 2020 seventh-round draft pick in exchange for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick.
Bennett's brother, Martellus, played for the Patriots in 2016 and part of 2017.
Last week, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that Martellus Bennett was interested in coming out of retirement to join his brother in New England.

26248413,"The Baltimore Ravens announced that they've agreed to terms with former Seattle Seahawks safety Earl Thomas and former New Orleans Saints running back Mark Ingram.
Thomas intends to sign a four-year, $55 million contract with the Ravens, a league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. The source said the deal includes $32 million fully guaranteed at signing, with $22 million coming in the first nine months.
Ingram plans to sign a three-year, $15 million deal with the Ravens, a source told Schefter and ESPN's Dianna Russini. Ingram was likely to leave New Orleans following reports on Tuesday that former Minnesota Vikings running back Latavius Murray expects to sign with the Saints.
Sources told ESPN's Mike Triplett that Ingram wanted more from the Saints than the three-year, $15 million deal he has agreed to with the Ravens and did not give New Orleans a counteroffer in that range. The Saints felt they had to move on to their four-year, $14.4 million contract agreement with Murray so they didn't risk losing out on him, too. A source said the Saints' best offer to Ingram was for four years and $17 million, with only $5 million guaranteed.
Thomas appeared to reference his deal with a tweet Wednesday that included the money-bag emoji. He also tweeted a goodbye to Seattle.
Yeaaaaaaaa !! 💰🙏🏾
Thank you Seattle for the love and memories that my family and I will never forget... ❤️☔️
Thomas' 2018 season ended Sept. 30 when he broke his left leg -- the same leg he broke in December 2016 -- while defending a pass in the end zone at the Arizona Cardinals. He had surgery a few days later.
The Seahawks were not in play to re-sign Thomas, a source close to the situation told ESPN's Brady Henderson. As strained as the relationship between Thomas and the Seahawks became over the past year, the source said the two sides parted on good terms.
Thomas, who will turn 30 in May, made six Pro Bowls in his nine seasons with the Seahawks and was named first-team All-Pro three times. His 28 career interceptions rank third among all players since 2010, when he was drafted by Seattle with the 14th overall pick out of Texas. His 107 consecutive starts from 2010 to 2016 represent the second-longest such streak in franchise history.
Thomas will return to CenturyLink Field this season, as the Ravens are slated to visit the Seahawks.
The arrival of Thomas gives the Ravens their best ball hawk since Pro Football Hall of Famer Ed Reed left following the 2012 Super Bowl season.
Thomas will fill the void left by Eric Weddle, who was cut last week. It's also a big step toward rebuilding last season's top-ranked defense, which lost linebackers C.J. Mosley, Terrell Suggs and Za'Darius Smith in the first two days of free agency.
The Ravens also got their targeted running back in Ingram. A source said Baltimore was never involved in negotiations with former Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell and always had its sights on the Saints free agent.

The move will be characterized as a letdown by many after Baltimore didn't land Bell, but Ingram has been an efficient runner, big-time producer in the red zone and valuable leader. He is the type of durable, physical back who should fit perfectly in the Ravens' running back-by-committee system.
Ingram ends Baltimore's patchwork tinkering at running back over the past four years, which included contributions from Justin Forsett, Terrance West, Alex Collins and Gus Edwards. Ingram also comes at a more moderate price than Bell, allowing the Ravens to address other needs as they build a supporting cast around quarterback Lamar Jackson.
Adam Schefter discusses Mark Ingram's intention to sign a three-year contract with the Ravens to become the lead back in Baltimore.
Veteran running backs often have thrived under new Ravens offensive coordinator Greg Roman. Frank Gore and LeSean McCoy enjoyed some of their best seasons with Roman as the playcaller.
Thomas has drawn comparisons to Reed throughout his career because of his great range. His ability to cover lots of ground should allow safety Tony Jefferson to play closer to the line of scrimmage.
Despite his stellar résumé -- Thomas is a shoo-in for the Seahawks Ring of Honor when his playing days are over -- his departure this offseason was considered a given following the tumultuous events of the past 15 months.
After a Christmas Eve win at Dallas in 2017, Thomas tracked down Cowboys coach Jason Garrett and told him to ""come get me"" if he was to become available. Thomas then missed the 2018 offseason program and training camp in protest of his contract situation, twice making public pleas for the Seahawks to either extend him or trade him as he entered the final year of a four-year, $40 million deal.
He returned from his holdout just before Seattle's season opener. After two interceptions in a Week 3 win over the Cowboys, Thomas told reporters that his absences in practice that week were tied to his displeasure over his contract, saying he needed to protect himself and that he would have been practicing if the Seahawks were invested in him like he was invested in himself.
No team values the free safety position more than Baltimore, so it ponied up serious money to secure a former member of the Legion of Boom.
The Saints intend to sign running back Latavius Murray, ending the eight-year run of Mark Ingram in New Orleans, a source told ESPN.
As he was being taken off the field on a cart after breaking his leg in Week 4, television cameras showed Thomas extending his middle finger toward the Seattle sideline. It would be the last image of him in a Seahawks uniform.
Ingram will turn 30 in December, which can be a taboo number for a running back. But the two-time Pro Bowler, 2011 first-round draft pick and former Heisman Trophy winner has played some of his best football over the past three seasons.
Plus, his mileage has been somewhat minimized by having spent much of his eight-year career with the Saints in time-shares -- including his historic pairing with Alvin Kamara over the past two seasons.
Kamara congratulated Ingram in a tweet on Tuesday.
Aye I gotta pay my rent... and my light bill.... and I got 6 girlfriends, I needa get dem situated. Lemme hold sum sir @MarkIngram22 💰 😂 love you bro congrats. You finna be cold as hell.
In 2017, they became the first duo to each surpass 1,500 yards from scrimmage in the same backfield, when Ingram ran for career highs of 1,124 yards and 12 touchdowns. Last season, Ingram became more of a No. 2 back after returning from a four-game suspension to start the season for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances; he finished with 645 rushing yards, 170 receiving yards and 6 touchdowns in 12 games.
Ingram also is respected off the field, as he was the Saints' 2018 Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee.
Due to the Saints' crowded backfield as well as a series of nagging injuries, Ingram's career got off to a slow start in New Orleans. But it really started to take off when he became the lead back in 2014 and was able to show off his versatility as both a runner and pass-catcher.
Ingram broke Deuce McAllister's franchise record for the Saints with his 50th rushing touchdown late last season, and his 6,007 career rushing yards are fewer than 100 yards shy of another franchise record. He also has 1,598 career receiving yards and five TD catches.

The Patriots relied on Dorsett more early in the 2018 season, when Julian Edelman was serving a four-game NFL suspension. Once Edelman returned and receiver Josh Gordon was acquired in a mid-September trade and eased into the team's system, Dorsett's playing time diminished.
Still, he showed a knack for catching most everything thrown in his direction and rising up in critical situations.
Dorsett joins four other Patriots receivers under contract for 2019: Edelman, Braxton Berrios, Damoun Patterson and Matthew Slater.
Dorsett told ESPN earlier this year that his goal is to be a starter, but he left open a return to New England.
""Me and him have a good relationship,"" he said of coach Bill Belichick. ""I believe he wants me back. I do believe that. At the end of the day, you really never know. I'm going in [to free agency] with blinders. I don't really know what's going to happen.
""Obviously, I want to win. I don't want to play this game just to play it. I play because I love it and the relationships. The whole organization was just amazing. Obviously, everyone has their personal goals, and I do want to be a bigger role. That's just the kind of guy I am. And helping the team win.""
Dorsett, who turned 26 in January, entered the NFL as a first-round draft choice (No. 29 overall) of the Colts in 2015. He has 95 receptions for 1,237 yards and six touchdowns in 57 games.
NFL Network first reported the agreement.

26267049,"ASHBURN, Va. --- The Washington Redskins' newest safety, Landon Collins, tapped the lectern and paused as he gathered himself, trying to recall a scene the previous night at an area restaurant: Owner Dan Snyder had presented Collins with an autographed game-worn Sean Taylor jersey.
Collins had plenty of other reasons to join the Redskins, but his desire started long ago thanks to Taylor, the Redskins' late safety who was murdered in 2007. Other safeties have joined the Redskins professing their love for Taylor. But Snyder didn't give them a signed jersey.
""It took me a good 30, 45 minutes to calm down,"" Collins said at his news conference Thursday. ""I couldn't even eat.""
The Redskins signed Collins to a six-year deal worth up to $84 million with $44.5 million in total guaranteed money. He was their one big free-agent splash and a player they had targeted as soon as they heard the New York Giants would not use the franchise tag on him. They were only going to be aggressive for certain players, with Collins at the top of their list. They also pursued linebacker C.J. Mosley.
Washington hopes the young safety finally ends its search for a physical presence in the secondary who can be a strong voice in the locker room.
Pro Bowl safety Landon Collins says he is signing with the Washington Redskins on six year, $84 million deal, with $45 million in guaranteed money.
""We weren't the only team in on [Collins] and rightfully so,"" said Doug Williams, the Redskins senior vice president of player personnel. ""Once we got in it, we were in it to win it.""
The Redskins have used 17 starting safeties in coach Jay Gruden's first five years. They need Collins to help solidify that area.
""We've gone against him many times and he was a major problem for our offense in the run game, in the pass game,"" Gruden said. ""People say he's just a box safety, but that's very far from the truth. I've seen him cover Jordan Reed out in space. He does a great job. He can do it all. Sure tackler. Fundamentals of tackling have gone out the window here. Not with him. He's a tone-setter. We have been looking for that type of player on our defense for a while.""
For Collins, playing in Washington represents change. He spent his first four seasons with the NFC East rival  Giants, where he earned three Pro Bowl berths and one All-Pro honor. But Collins said he knew once the Giants decided not to tag him that his days in New York had ended. At one point, Collins said he didn't think he'd ever leave New York, but once he saw other players get traded or cut, he knew his fate as well.
""When we were going through the turmoil that was going on up there and all the craziness, all the trades, all the cuts, I was like, 'I don't think I am here either,'"" Collins said. ""No talks were going on. Nothing was being said. ... But, at the same time I don't know what the future holds with the New York Giants, but I'm glad it happened because now I'm in that burgundy and gold.""
Collins said once he knew he'd be free, he chatted with former Alabama teammates currently on the Redskins' defense -- there are four on that side of the ball. He even called Dr. James Andrews, who is also affiliated with both Alabama and the Redskins, to have him talk with Washington owner Dan Snyder.
His desire to play for Washington began long ago as he grew up a fan of Taylor; he even told ESPN's Dianna Russini before the 2015 draft that his dream was to play in Washington. He said he watched only three or four games of his on TV. But he spent ""years and years and years watching tape after tape after tape"" of Taylor. Numerous safeties wear Taylor's old No. 21 in honor of him. The Redskins used two safeties the past two years who idolized Taylor in Su'a Cravens and D.J. Swearinger. But both are gone. And neither was a big-splash signing like Collins.
That's why Snyder presented him the jersey at the Wednesday dinner, a moment that still choked up Collins during his news conference. At the dinner, Snyder kept the jersey in a box -- Collins kept wanting to know the contents. But Snyder told him they would wait for Collins' mother and girlfriend to arrive first.
After they showed up, Snyder stood and told the story of what Taylor meant to him.
""Telling me how he loved him as a son,"" Collins said. ""And when he told me that it was a game-worn jersey signed by him in the box, instantly broke down, instantly broke down, straight into tears.""
Snyder tried to hand him the box, but Collins, whose son Camden was on his lap, said he couldn't grab it.

""I couldn't move, shaking, son on my lap, my son actually grabbed the box and started opening the box,"" Collins said. ""I'm still crying, the emotion behind it and my son pulls the jersey out of the box. I still can't touch the jersey, just staring at it the whole time. The jersey is right there on the table, everybody is kind of at the table quiet just sitting there and I look at Ryan Anderson who's at the table, I start shaking my head at him and he says, 'Man, I should have told you what's in the box so you don't have to cry.'""
Collins said he would like to wear the number.
""I have to ask Mr. Snyder and we have to talk to his family,"" Collins said. ""I love that burden. I love that passion. I love that on my shoulders. I definitely could carry that.""
It added up to an emotional week for Collins. When he got the news from his agent, David Mulugheta, about the deal, Collins was driving to work out in Miami.
""When he called me and told me the news, I literally broke down,"" Collins said. ""I broke down. I just broke down. I didn't pull the car over, I fought the urge because I still had to go get my shoes to go work out. From that point on I was just in shock and awe and humbly gracious for this opportunity.""

26243468,"The New York Giants traded superstar wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to the Cleveland Browns on Tuesday night, creating pandemonium in the sports world.
What should we make of the deal? We asked our experts who cover the league to weigh in, from projecting OBJ's statline this season to making a pick for the AFC North title.

The full details of the trade: OBJ to the Browns for a first-round pick (No. 17 overall), third-round pick (No. 95) and safety Jabrill Peppers, who was a first-rounder in 2017.
Jump to:
The love-it-or-hate-it scale: Browns | Giants
Predicting OBJ's stat line | Who will win the AFC North?
Matt Bowen, NFL writer: 10. Give Browns general manager John Dorsey the credit here. That's a strong move to land Beckham, a dynamic talent who can win at all three levels of the route tree. Playmaking ability to pair with QB Baker Mayfield, WR Jarvis Landry and RB Nick Chubb in Freddie Kitchens' system. That's going to be a tough offense to prep for.
Mike Clay, fantasy writer: 9. The Browns got the best player in the deal -- a 26-year-old superstar wide receiver and offensive game-changer signed through 2023. Draft picks are far from sure things, and though Jabrill Peppers did take a step forward in 2018, he was still playing only two-thirds of the defensive snaps.
Dan Graziano, national NFL writer: 10. Beckham is a monster player, an incredible difference-maker, and a better player than the Browns should have been able to get for their offense. With Landry (who honest-to-God is Beckham's closest friend in the world) working underneath and Beckham stretching the field, Baker Mayfield is going to be able to open things up even more than he did last season. The Browns were already a division favorite in my mind and now it's even clearer. Dorsey could end up a Cleveland legend, and Eliot Wolf, Alonzo Highsmith and all those former Packers execs he brought in for his front office are going to be hot GM candidates in no time.
Mina Kimes, NFL writer: 10. When I saw what the Browns gave up for Beckham, I was stunned -- I thought it would take more than one first-round pick. He's young, he's one of the most talented receivers in recent NFL history, and his contract, which will cost them a little more than $15 million a year going forward, is a relative bargain. This is a heist for Cleveland.
Jason Reid, The Undefeated senior writer: 10. Ah, that's all it took for the Browns to get a transcendent wideout who won't turn 27 until November? It's hard to fathom that the Giants would make such a move without receiving multiple first-rounders in return for Beckham. You're talking about a game-changer who demands double coverage. And when those safeties roll to Beckham, Landry will feast on midrange routes. Already on the cusp of being an elite passer as a rookie, Mayfield will enter his second season with the receiving corps he needs to skyrocket to Tier 1 status. And if you think that's a stretch, just sit back and watch.
From questions of ""what is going on?"" to claims of ""fake news,"" players are showing their surprise at New York's stunning trade of its star receiver to Cleveland.
Former top-10 pick Ereck Flowers is headed to Washington in one of the worst moves of free agency. Bill Barnwell evaluates the biggest deals.
We're keeping track of every notable signing, trade and cut throughout the month, with analysis from our experts.
Mike Sando, senior NFL writer: 7. Getting an elite talent in his prime and under contract is tough to do. The Browns pulled it off. The big question I have -- and it is a big one -- is how well Beckham fits into any larger culture the Browns might be trying to create. This concern is mitigated some by the presence in Cleveland of Beckham's college position coach (Adam Henry) and college teammate (Landry). But with Beckham, Landry and other strong personalities in that locker room, including possibly Earl Thomas, the Browns are asking a lot from first-time head coach Freddie Kitchens. This team could be spectacular or blow up spectacularly.

Kevin Seifert, national NFL writer: 9. Nothing and no one is perfect. The Browns have taken into their locker room a strong and emotional personality. They have a second-year quarterback and a rookie head coach. There will be some growing pains. On the field, however, this deal is lights out.
Field Yates, NFL analyst: 10. When you have a chance to acquire one of the premier playmakers in the NFL who is under contract for five more seasons, you don't blink. The Browns did not. This is a home run.
Bowen: 2. I'm struggling to figure out the direction of the franchise -- and the identity the Giants are trying to build -- after trading away Beckham in the prime of his career. Yes, the Giants got multiple picks and Peppers in the deal, but Beckham is a game-changer. Hard to find those guys.
Clay: 1. What on earth are the Giants doing? Dumping Beckham is their most egregious move yet, but they've also moved on from NT Damon Harrison, CB Eli Apple, LB Olivier Vernon and S Landon Collins over the past year. Newcomer Peppers is only 23 and certainly could emerge to become a difference-maker and they've done a nice job upgrading the offensive line, but at what cost? This 38-year-old-quarterback-led roster is officially one of the worst in the league.
Graziano: 1. The Giants are an unmitigated fiasco at this point. You can argue that they should be in rebuild mode and you'd be right. The problem is they should have been in rebuild mode last year and Gettleman insisted (and operated as if) they weren't. If you're in rebuild mode, you don't even sign Beckham to the deal you gave him last summer. Now they're eating $28 million in dead money over the next two years and have paid Beckham a little bit less than $22 million for 12 games. Last year was the QB draft, and they took a running back. This year is the defensive line draft, and they might need to take a QB instead. They're not keeping up with reality.
Dan Orlovsky sees the Browns as serious Super Bowl LIV contenders after their trade for Odell Beckham Jr.
Kimes: 2. I'm dumbfounded. Unlike Antonio Brown, Beckham didn't force New York's hand. The fact that they're trading him so quickly after extending him (the team will incur $16 million in dead money this year), makes me question the Giants' strategy. It seems possible that they're trying to accrue assets to pursue a young quarterback, but isn't that a need they should've foreseen last year before they paid Beckham?
Reid: 1. I would have gone lower, but the editors didn't provide that option. I've been saying for weeks that the Giants must have a plan. And they do: It just appears to be a really, really bad one. Why did they recommit to Eli Manning for another season and trade Beckham, who received a massive deal last summer? Why didn't they draft a quarterback in last year's quarterback-deep draft? And if they're about to begin a rebuild, why is Manning still atop the roster? What's clear is that Tuna (Bill Parcells), Lawrence Taylor and Phil Simms aren't walking through that door. And even if they did, they couldn't help fix this mess.

Sando: 3. It's usually a terrible sign when an organization led by the same people changes course so abruptly within a one-year span. What is the plan? If the Giants realized they made a mistake by signing Beckham to a rich deal, it's understandable that they might want to undo that mistake. However, they should have known all they needed to know about Beckham before entering into an extension. At least they got something in return.
Seifert: 2. Even if you could make a plausible argument for trading a transcendent player locked into a five-year contract, it's impossible to believe that this is all you could get for him. The only partially redeeming consequence for the Giants will be if they use the first-round pick to move up and draft a quarterback who could replace Manning sooner rather than later.

Yates: 1. This underscores what some around the NFL have believed for quite some time: The Giants were never fully sold on Beckham from the moment they signed him to an extension. In the NFL, it's important to have a clear path, even if it's one that means retooling or rebuilding. What is the Giants' path?
Bowen: 84 catches, 1,250 yards, 11 TDs
Clay: 95 catches, 1,241 yards, 10 TDs
Graziano: 96 catches, 1,374 yards, 12 TDs. How did I arrive at these numbers? Oh, I just averaged his first three NFL seasons.
Kimes: 80 catches, 1,400 yards, 10 TDs
Reid: 100 catches, 1,550 yards, 15 TDs

Sando: 85 catches, 1,300 yards, nine TDs
Seifert: 63 catches, 1,321 yards, eight TDs
Yates: 81 catches, 1,312 yards, 11 TDs
Bowen: Browns. Their nucleus of talent on offense will put them in a position to compete with the league's best, but don't forget about the defensive front Dorsey has put together. Those are the guys who will close out games in December to pull away from the Ravens and Steelers in the AFC North.
Clay: Browns. The Steelers' demise has been greatly exaggerated -- they still have a pretty good roster despite the Antonio Brown trade -- but Cleveland's acquisition of Beckham pushes the Browns to the top of the division for the first time in a long time. Cleveland still needs work at linebacker and safety, and the offensive line is OK at best, but the offseason is young. Mayfield & Co. are primed to get Cleveland back to the playoffs for the first time since 2002.
Graziano: Browns. They were my pick before this, and the way this week has gone for them, the Ravens and the Steelers wouldn't make anyone move off it. Even though I know Seifert is going to tell me it's the ""easy"" pick.

Kimes: Browns. I think the Steelers' offense shouldn't decline too much, even without Brown, but their defense isn't there yet. The Ravens' defense has taken a hit in free agency. And the Bengals ... yeah, I'll go with the Browns.
Reid: Browns. This will be the en vogue pick because of Beckham. I get that. It's also the correct pick.
Sando: Steelers. I go back and forth on this one. The Browns are the most talented team in the division. They should win it on talent. I'm just not sure a first-time head coach will handle the personalities, expectations and questionable ownership. I'll stick with Pittsburgh for now while reserving the right to abandon ship.
Seifert: Ravens. It's too easy to pick the Browns right now. (And the Steelers and Bengals are both a mess, of course.) Are we certain that the Browns' new coaching staff will pull all of these new (and talented) players together seamlessly and immediately in a way that hasn't happened in a quarter century for this franchise?
Yates: Browns. Sure, this will be perceived as a knee-jerk reaction. And that might be the case. It's fair to note that a first-time full-time head coach in Kitchens will have his work cut out for him to manage expectations surrounding the team and its swell of talent. But the Browns also showed last season that they're tough, explosive and unafraid.

The Browns traded for Collins the season after he led New England in tackles and went to the Pro Bowl. Cleveland then signed him to a four-year, $50 million contract before he hit free agency in 2017.
Collins started eight games for the Browns after the trade, but missed 10 games in 2017 after he needed surgery for a torn medial collateral ligament.

He returned to start all 16 games in 2018 and led the team in tackles with 104 (73 solo), with 4 sacks and an interception, forced fumble and a fumble recovery.
But while Collins' play was solid, it was never spectacular. In 30 starts in Cleveland, he had 7 sacks and 4 interceptions. But none were major game-changing plays worthy of a contract that made him one of the highest-paid linebackers in the league.
"
26272054,"The NFL has suspended Cleveland Browns running back Kareem Hunt for the first eight games of the upcoming season for violating its personal conduct policy, the league announced.
The NFL said that Hunt's suspension stems from a February 2018 incident in which he shoved and kicked a woman during an early-morning altercation outside his downtown Cleveland residence, and an incident in June 2018 that involved a physical altercation with other men at Put-in-Bay, Ohio.
Release of the video from the February incident, and the fact that Hunt had lied about it, prompted the Kansas City Chiefs to release the running back on Nov. 30. The NFL investigated a third incident in Kansas City, but said there would be no discipline from that.
Hunt was not charged in any of the incidents.
Hunt has advised the league that he accepts the decision.
Hunt will forfeit $303,529 of his $645,000 base salary with his eight-game suspension. Upon return he'll have a chance to earn $200,000 in per-game roster bonuses. He'll then be a restricted free agent next offseason for the Browns.
Ryan Fitzpatrick is headed to Miami to replace Ryan Tannehill. Is it a good deal for a rebuilding team? Bill Barnwell evaluates the biggest deals.
The Browns know that Odell Beckham Jr. brings some baggage, but general manager John Dorsey thinks his talent outweighs the risk.
""I want to again apologize for my actions last year. I know that my behavior hurt a lot of people, and I again apologize to them,"" Hunt said in a statement released by the team. ""I respect the league's decision on discipline, and I appreciate the time I spent with Commissioner [Roger] Goodell last week. I'm grateful for my time with the Browns over the last month and thankful to all the people in the organization that have welcomed me. I also appreciate all of the support I received from my union through this process. My commitment to earning the trust of the league, my teammates, the organization and this community through my actions will continue, and I understand there is a lot of hard work ahead of me before I'm able to fully return to playing the game I love.""
Hunt can take part in the team's OTAs, minicamps and preseason games. His suspension will not take effect until Aug. 31, the day of final roster reductions before the season opener. The Browns expect him to be present for the start of offseason workouts April 1.
Browns general manager John Dorsey drafted Hunt for the Chiefs in 2017, when Dorsey was the team's GM.
""I want everybody to know we have done extensive research in regards to this case, this player,"" Dorsey told reporters last month in explaining why the team signed Hunt. ""He understands and takes full responsibility for the egregious act he committed. He is extremely remorseful for his actions.""
Hunt led the NFL in rushing as a rookie in 2017 with 1,327 yards and eight touchdowns in helping Kansas City qualify for the playoffs. He also had 53 receptions for 455 yards and three touchdowns. Last season, he rushed for 824 yards and seven touchdowns in 11 games and had seven receiving touchdowns before he was released.

26255947,"Even as they signal a commitment to a rebuilding plan, the New York Giants still do not expect to move on from 38-year-old quarterback Eli Manning this year, according to multiple sources familiar with their strategy.
Manning has one year left on his contract. He is scheduled to earn an $11.5 million salary, a $500,000 workout bonus and a $5 million roster bonus if he is still on the roster at 4 p.m. ET this Saturday.
If the Giants were to release Manning prior to that time, they would save all $17 million of that salary and bonus money in both cash and cap space this year, as well as carry a reasonable $6.2 million dead-money cap charge for what's left of Manning's signing bonus.
However, while such a plan might make sense for a rebuilding team, sources said the Giants at this time expect to keep their two-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback on the roster through that deadline and start him at quarterback for one more season.
""He's what we have at this point,"" one Giants source said Wednesday.
Kyler Murray completed 61 of his 67 workout passes at his pro day on Wednesday, throwing in front of about 75 NFL executives, coaches and scouts. He confirmed he met with the Giants after the pro day.
Could Cleveland really be favorites to make the playoffs? How many touchdowns will OBJ score in 2019? Our experts discuss.
The Giants do, according to the sources, acknowledge the need to address the issue of Manning's successor at some point soon. Following this week's trade of star wideout Odell Beckham Jr. to the Cleveland Browns, the Giants hold the No. 6 and No. 17 picks in the first round of this year's draft. Giants executives were at Oklahoma's pro day Wednesday to check out and meet with quarterback Kyler Murray, and they'll surely do the same with Ohio State's Dwayne Haskins, Missouri's Drew Lock and others.
However, the Giants are not certain to take a quarterback in the first round of this year's draft. The sources said the team was still in the process of evaluating the available quarterbacks and wouldn't feel compelled to take one if it didn't think they were worth it. The Giants held the No. 2 pick in last year's draft, in which four quarterbacks were picked in the top 10, but they used it to take running back Saquon Barkley.
Should they decide not to take a quarterback early in this year's draft, perhaps instead using those two first-round picks to help rebuild their defense in a defense-heavy draft, the Giants believe they have options.
Sources said they would explore a trade for Arizona's Josh Rosen, if the Cardinals decide to make him available, but that they aren't sure yet whether that will happen or whether they would be sure to make an offer for Rosen if it did.
There's also a belief that next year's first round could feature promising quarterback options such as Oregon's Justin Herbert and Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa or that a current young NFL option such as Teddy Bridgewater could be available again next offseason.
Giants general manager Dave Gettleman insisted last offseason that he believed the team could compete in 2018. Sticking with Manning, drafting Barkley, signing expensive players such as Nate Solder and Patrick Omameh and trading for pricey veteran linebacker Alec Ogletree signaled that intention. They signed Beckham to a five-year contract extension last summer that included a $20 million signing bonus and $41 million fully guaranteed at signing. Gettleman said more than once since that extension that the Giants ""didn't sign Odell to trade him.""
But the Giants went 5-11 last season, and trade Beckham they just did -- to the Browns for a first-round pick, a third-round pick and safety Jabrill Peppers. The Giants also sent veteran defensive end Olivier Vernon -- one of the prized 2016 free agents than helped them to their only winning season in the past six years -- to Cleveland for guard Kevin Zeitler.
The Giants let former All-Pro safety Landon Collins become a free agent rather than using an $11.15 million franchise tag on him. And they didn't make any pricey signings during this free agency's first wave. All of this signals a team determined to use 12 draft picks this year to help it rebuild around young players, with Barkley as the focus of the offense and the long-term face of the franchise.
Manning, however, will apparently stick around for one more season in spite of New York's decision to go young. One source said the Giants believe Manning can play better than he has in recent years if the team continues to improve the offensive line, and Zeitler should help with that.
Another source pointed out that cutting Manning, a surefire future Giants Ring of Honor member, to save $5 million wouldn't be the classiest way to treat one of the most accomplished and decorated players in the team's long history. So, it appears Manning will stay, perhaps with the assignment to help groom a drafted successor, possibly while the team continues to figure out its long-term plan at the position.
The Giants are rebuilding, but at this point that doesn't mean they're ready to move on from their longtime franchise QB.

26239259,"Former Minnesota Vikings running back Latavius Murray intends to sign a four-year, $14.4 million deal with the New Orleans Saints, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Tuesday, spelling the end of the Mark Ingram era in the Big Easy.
Murray thanked the Vikings for his time with the team in an Instagram post Tuesday.
 Thank you to the Vikings organization for giving me an opportunity to do what I love to do. My time in Minnesota has been unforgettable because of the fans, the community and most importantly because of the guys in that locker room. Thank you for being the birthplace of my first child and spoiling my family with those Minnesota nice vibes. Nothing but love from the Tay 🚂...Skol Vikes
A post shared by  Latavius Murray (@lataviusmurray) on Mar 12, 2019 at 1:50pm PDT
Before the Vikings drafted running back Dalvin Cook in 2017, Murray joined the team in free agency as the expected heir apparent to Adrian Peterson. Out of respect for Minnesota's all-time leading rusher, Murray decided to switch his jersey from No. 28, which he wore in Oakland, to No. 25 ahead of the 2017 season.
Cook ended up winning the starting job in training camp as a rookie but suffered an ACL tear four games into the 2017 season. Murray stepped in and, paired with Jerick McKinnon, led a Vikings rushing attack that ranked seventh in the league during the team's run to the NFC Championship Game.
Quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is nearing a deal to remain with the Saints, but no agreement has yet been reached, sources told ESPN.
During free agency in 2018, the Vikings restructured Murray's contract to avoid making the running back a cap casualty. In turn, the third year of his current deal was voided, making him a free agent this offseason.
Murray, who turned 29 in January, again filled an important role last season when Cook missed all but one half of play from Weeks 3-8 while recovering from a hamstring injury. In 16 games with six starts, Murray totaled 578 rushing yards and six touchdowns.
After a disappointing end to the 2018 season and with his future in Minnesota uncertain, Murray had expressed a desire to earn a starting role for the following season.

He played his first three seasons with the Raiders and earned his lone Pro Bowl selection in 2015 when he rushed for a career-best 1,066 yards. He has rushed for 3,698 yards and 34 touchdowns in 77 games. He also has 128 receptions for 883 yards.
Ingram turns 30 in December, which can be a taboo number for a running back. But the two-time Pro Bowler, 2011 first-round draft pick and former Heisman Trophy winner has played some of his best football over the past three seasons.
Plus, his mileage has been somewhat tempered by spending much of his eight-year career with the Saints in timeshares -- including his historic pairing with Alvin Kamara over the past two seasons.
In 2017, they became the first duo to each surpass 1,500 yards from scrimmage in the same backfield, when Ingram ran for career highs of 1,124 yards and 12 touchdowns. Last season, Ingram became more of a No. 2 back after returning from a four-game suspension to start the season for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances.

In the wild-card playoff win at Baltimore, he became the first player in nearly two years to have an interception and fumble recovery in a postseason game.
Phillips earned a chance to play regularly last season because injuries at linebacker forced defensive coordinator Gus Bradley to play seven defensive backs.

With 13,318 yards, Peterson is the eighth-leading rusher in NFL history. He moved up five spots on the all-time list last season, passing Marshall Faulk, Jim Brown, Tony Dorsett and Eric Dickerson. He has 106 rushing touchdowns for his career, tied with Brown for fifth all time.
Due to a diminished role with the New Orleans Saints and a neck injury after a trade to the Arizona Cardinals, Peterson finished the 2017 season with just 529 yards. He remained unsigned until the Redskins called him in mid-August, after losing Guice.
Peterson spent his first 10 seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, where he was named to seven Pro Bowls and was first-team All-Pro four times. His best season was 2012, when he rushed for 2,097 yards and was named NFL MVP -- after tearing his ACL the previous December.
He surpassed 1,000 rushing yards seven times with the Vikings and led the league in rushing on three occasions.

26104212,"In total, there were 217 diagnosed concussions in practices and games during the 2018 season, compared to 291 in 2017, the league revealed Thursday during a meeting of its Head, Neck and Spine committee at the scouting combine. League officials had previously acknowledged a drop in concussions during the preseason and regular season but had not yet added the playoff numbers. There were 10 concussions during the 2017 playoffs.
The overall drop of approximately 25 percent from 2017 to 2018 came after a ""call to action"" from Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL's chief medical officer, during the 2017 combine. The league joined the NFL Players Association to produce a three-part concussion-reduction strategy: intervening in early training camp practices, prohibiting underperforming helmet models and instituting a series of rule changes rooted in biomechanical research.
Concussions did not decrease during training camp practices, Sills said during Thursday's meeting, a portion of which was open to reporters. But 50 percent of players moved into better-performing helmets, according to the league. Meanwhile, two significant rule changes -- use of helmet and a reimagined kickoff -- were passed with concussions in mind and contributed to a 29 percent drop in concussions during games.
Sills said the 2018 numbers were ""very positive"" but said the league asked its injury-data consultants to determine whether the numbers could be attributed to the reduction strategy or random variance. Concussion totals over the past six seasons have ranged from 206 in 2014 to last season's high of 291.
The league is convinced, Sills said, that the drop was not random.
""As physicians and scientists,"" Sills said, ""we would all say if we had a disease and came up with a plan to attack it, a 25 percent reduction in one year is really a very positive start. At the same time, we have to say that the work is clearly not done. There is no finish line in health and safety. We're very pleased and proud of this start, but there is more work to be done.""

The Redskins had pursued him last offseason as well, but Rodgers-Cromartie wanted to wait and Washington instead signed Orlando Scandrick. The Redskins released Scandrick in camp. Rodgers-Cromartie was enticing for Washington last year because of his versatility. The Redskins wanted someone who could play either in the slot or outside or even safety in a pinch.
Former top-10 pick Ereck Flowers is headed to Washington in one of the worst moves of free agency. Bill Barnwell evaluates the biggest deals.
Who is still out there on the open market? Here are the top free agents looking for new homes, including pass-rusher Ezekiel Ansah.
Washington lacked a veteran backup corner in 2018 and it hurt them. The Redskins had three rookies as backups and suffered their growing pains in several games,  especially with veteran Quinton Dunbar slowed by a nerve issue in his leg that eventually landed him on injured reserve. The Redskins also have Josh Norman, who has a $14.5 million salary-cap hit this year, and third-year cornerback Fabian Moreau, who started in the slot.
Rodgers-Cromartie turns 33 in April so it's uncertain how much he has left. He was with Oakland for seven games but did not play in two. He made one start, but did not play the following week and then announced his retirement. Rodgers-Cromartie was a first-round pick by Arizona in 2008 and played three years with the Cardinals. He also played two years with Philadelphia, one with Denver and four with the Giants. He spent three years with Collins, whom the Redskins signed earlier this week.

26230526,"The Detroit Lions have made big moves to bolster their defense on the first day of the NFL's negotiating period.
Defensive end Trey Flowers has agreed to a five-year deal with Detroit that's expected to average between $16 million and $17 million per year, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Nickel cornerback Justin Coleman is heading to Detroit on a four-year deal worth $36 million, according to ESPN's Michael Rothstein and multiple reports. Coleman's deal would be the richest ever for a nickel cornerback.
Bob Quinn and the Lions were willing to spend to fill needs at pass-rusher and cornerback, and they got not only good players but good fits.
Wide receiver Danny Amendola has signed with the Lions, where he will reunite with general manager Bob Quinn and coach Matt Patricia.
Lions head coach Matt Patricia was New England's defensive coordinator before taking over in Detroit ahead of last season, and Flowers and Coleman have Patriots ties.
A fourth-round selection by New England in 2015, Flowers, 25, led the Pats in sacks each of the past three seasons, with his 7.5 in 2018 setting a career high.
Coleman, who will turn 26 on March 27, was a steal for the Seattle Seahawks after they acquired him from the Patriots for a seventh-round pick shortly before the 2017 season opener.
At 6-foot-2 and 265 pounds with unusually long arms (34¼ inches), Flowers was a chess piece for the Patriots' ever-changing defense with his ability to play a variety of techniques. In 46 regular-season games, he has totaled 164 tackles, 21 sacks and five forced fumbles. In nine playoff games, he has amassed 39 tackles and 5.5 sacks.
Coleman spent the past two seasons as Seattle's nickelback, recording 90 tackles, three interceptions and 19 passes defended. He returned both of his interceptions for touchdowns in 2017, and he had a fumble return for a touchdown last season.
According to Pro Football Reference, Coleman appeared in 59.6 percent and 67.8 percent of Seattle's defensive snaps the past two regular seasons and did not miss a game.

The 25-year-old James proved to be a versatile, reliable and durable option during his first four NFL seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers, catching 120 passes for 1,189 yards and nine touchdowns. He also proved crucial in the running game and the team's coveted two-tight-end sets.
The former fifth-round pick (160th overall) in 2015 might be best known for the catch he didn't actually make. James' play against the Patriots in 2017, ruled incomplete because he didn't ""survive the ground"" while lunging over the goal line, sparked controversy leaguewide.
The play was a catalyst for the NFL competition committee's decision to tweak the catch rule to accommodate players attempting football moves after securing the ball. The Steelers failed to score at the end of that New England game, and losing to the Patriots cost the team home-field advantage in the playoffs.

26093177,"The Indiana Gaming Commission said Jones was arrested for disorderly conduct, public intoxication, intimidation and resisting arrest at the casino, which is located about 25 miles southwest of Cincinnati.
The commission said its agents were called to the casino ""to investigate a patron for possible cheating at a table game"" and that Jones ""immediately became verbally combative and disorderly with agents and casino staff.""
The 35-year-old Jones was booked into the Dearborn County Law Enforcement Center in nearby Lawrenceburg at 3:10 a.m. ET.
Jones, a veteran of 14 NFL seasons, appeared in seven games for the Broncos last season, making two starts, and had an interception, three passes defensed and nine tackles. He also returned 10 punts and four kickoffs for Denver.
Prior to joining the Broncos, Jones spent eight seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals. He was arrested in January 2017 for allegedly pushing a security guard and failing to comply with law enforcement.
A video from the back of a cop car showed Jones going on a tirade against the arresting officer and telling him ""I hope you die tomorrow."" The NFL suspended Jones for the 2018 season opener after the incident.
He was charged with misdemeanor assault, disorderly conduct and obstructing official business, along with a felony charge of harassment with a bodily substance for spitting on the hand of a nurse while being booked.
The prosecutor declined to pursue the felony charge, and all other charges were dropped except obstructing official business, to which Jones pleaded guilty.
Jones, who joined the Bengals in 2010, turned his career around in Cincinnati after it almost ended when he was suspended for the entire 2007 season after an incident in a Las Vegas nightclub that resulted in a man being paralyzed. Jones was later ordered to pay $12 million in damages to the victim.

26119276,"Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown said he believes he will be dealt by the team because that's ""what's good for their business,"" but he does not ""take any blame"" for the breakdown of his relationship with the franchise that has led to him being on the trading block.
In an extensive interview with ESPN's Jeff Darlington following a tour of his childhood neighborhood of Liberty City in Miami earlier this week, Brown also talked about situations with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, coach Mike Tomlin and ownership that contributed to his desire to get out of Pittsburgh.
""I don't take any blame,"" Brown told Darlington. ""I just think I took responsibility for my situation. You know, I didn't point the finger, I didn't make no one look bad, I didn't throw no stones at anyone.""
Although other teams could emerge, the belief right now is that the Raiders, Redskins and Titans are the most likely landing spots for receiver Antonio Brown, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown told ESPN on Tuesday that he is not ""angry"" with the team, but he maintained his desire to be traded.
Brown is officially on the trading block after meeting with Steelers brass earlier this month in South Florida. Both parties agreed that it's best to work on a trade, though general manager Kevin Colbert made it clear the team wants ""significant compensation.""
The three teams that have shown the most interest in Brown to date are the Oakland Raiders, Washington Redskins and Tennessee Titans, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Other teams have had conversations with the Steelers and another could emerge. But the belief as of now is that the Raiders, Redskins and Titans are the most likely landing spots, sources said.
As far as what went wrong this season, Brown described what he believed was a disconnect with ownership.
""Sometimes things are bigger than just my issues, you know?"" Brown said. ""If you work for me for nine years, wouldn't you expect you to know my girlfriend's name or my dad's name or my kid or, you know, would you expect me to meet your kid or at least know you on the level of some sort of integrity to know, like, 'Hey, man, I appreciate what you do.'""
Brown also talked about his relationship with Roethlisberger, who publicly questioned the wide receiver's route-running after a game-ending interception to the Denver Broncos in Week 12 of the 2018 season.
""Criticism really is a part of the job, you know what I'm saying? I answer criticism with achievement,"" Brown said. ""But, you know, and the professional level is, like, yo, like, if I'm your guy, make me know I'm your guy. But don't say I'm your guy and then point the finger. Don't say I'm your guy and then don't throw me the ball the whole first quarter.
""I would've liked for me and Ben to be cool. You know what I mean? I thought we was cool. But when I think ... I've been to his house one time. He's been to my house one time. You know what I mean? We don't work out in the offseason. You think that's winning? That's not winning.''
Brown owns an NFL record six consecutive 100-catch seasons, but he frustrated the organization when he failed to show up for a workday in Week 17 and was benched for the season finale.
He said he was told to ""go home"" by Tomlin after telling him he was ""sore"" ahead of the Week 17 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals. Tomlin said he attempted without success to communicate with Brown leading up to game day but did not hear from Brown's agent until the day of the game, when Tomlin was told Brown was available to play.
Said Brown: ""So the last game of the year, I went home.""
The Steelers' asking price for Brown started as a first-round pick and other compensation but has been reduced to a first-round pick, sources told Schefter. Brown said he believes he will be traded because the Steelers can avoid paying him a $2.5 million roster bonus by trading or releasing him before March 17.
""Why wouldn't they not trade me? They gotta pay me $2.5 million on March 17,"" he said. ""If I invoice you March 17, $2.5 million that you gotta pay me, would you pay it or would you get somebody else to pay it? So it's what -- pretty much what's good for their business. ...
""They want to start a fresh offseason with no bad blood so their team could just focus on football. No distraction from any player. So I think they'll get it done.""

26274477,"Baker Mayfield summed up his attitude about Odell Beckham Jr. joining Jarvis Landry in the Cleveland Browns offense this way: Let it rip.
""You could say the same thing about me; you don't want to tame it,"" the Browns quarterback told reporters in the Milwaukee Brewers locker room in Phoenix.
""You just let them be themselves and make plays. That's who they are, and when it comes down to it, the guys in that locker room, you're going to love playing with them.""
Mayfield was at the Brewers' spring training camp because he is friends with outfielder Christian Yelich. Mayfield's comments were the first since the Browns acquired Beckham and defensive end Olivier Vernon in a trade with the New York Giants earlier in the week.
The Browns signed Kareem Hunt in February and now know they won't have him available for the first eight games of the season.
Mayfield's attitude has been his mantra since he joined the Browns and was part of the reason he set a rookie record with 27 touchdowns passes in 2018. His comments came in response to a question about Beckham and Landry being large personalities, and with them, maybe he should just let it rip.
""I know from Saquon [Barkley] and Sterling Shepard [of the Giants], who I'm very close with, I know exactly who OBJ is inside the locker room and who he is to his teammates,"" Mayfield said. ""That's the most important thing. People can have their attitudes and perspective on it, but he's himself and he also has his teammates' back.""
Mayfield called the Browns' potential exciting and said the team's offense will ""be a thing where you pick your poison"" given the talent available, which also includes running back Nick Chubb and will include Kareem Hunt after he serves his eight-game suspension.
""It's an exciting time in Cleveland, absolutely,"" Mayfield said. ""The fans there, after having a decent year, nothing that we were too happy about [7-8-1], were unbelievably satisfied. But now, I can't even imagine.
""I haven't been back yet, so it's going to be really exciting to go back.""

Bridgewater, 26, had an 11-5 record and a playoff appearance in 2015, his second season with the Vikings. However, his career was derailed for nearly two full seasons after a gruesome left knee injury in the summer of 2016 that included a torn ACL and other structural damage.
He signed a one-year, incentive-laden deal with the New York Jets as a free agent last March, then was traded to the Saints during the preseason for a 2019 third-round pick. Bridgewater made his first start in nearly three years when the Saints rested Brees in Week 17.
Although Bridgewater threw for just 118 yards with one touchdown and one interception in a loss to the Carolina Panthers, he continued to show teams that he was healthy again.
The 6-foot-2, 215-pounder was drafted 32nd overall by the Vikings in 2014. He went 6-6 as a rookie starter and helped Minnesota reach the playoffs the following season. He threw for a total of 6,150 yards, 28 touchdowns and 21 interceptions in those two seasons.

By releasing the 31-year-old Lang, the Lions saved $8,843,750 in cap room and also avoided paying him a $750,000 roster bonus that would have been due next week.
""I'd like to express my sincerest appreciation to the Detroit Lions organization, particularly Bob Quinn, for allowing a kid from Ferndale a chance to accomplish a dream of mine and play for my hometown team,"" Lang said Friday on Twitter. ""... Thanks to you, the fans, for taking me in as one of your own 2 years ago. The love and support has been overwhelming.""
Injuries hampered Lang's career with the Lions and, even toward the end of the season, he said he wasn't sure what his future was going to hold.
Lang made the Pro Bowl in back-to-back years in 2016 with Green Bay and 2017 with the Lions. And when he was healthy, Lang was a good asset for the Lions.
But he dealt with injuries throughout his two seasons in Detroit, including being limited to six games last season while dealing with a concussion and a neck injury among other ailments.
Before going to Detroit, Lang was a stalwart at right guard for Green Bay. Between the Lions and Packers, he has played in 138 games, starting 113 of them.

26265948,"The move, which leaves the team with a $14.7 million hit in dead money, has a post-June 1 designation.
Former general manager Dave Gettleman signed Kalil in free agency prior to the 2017 season to fill a void on the line. That reunited Kalil with his brother, longtime Panthers center Ryan Kalil, who retired after this past season.

The five-year, $55.5 million deal for Matt Kalil, who missed most of the 2016 season for Minnesota with a hip injury, was criticized by league pundits. The criticism continued as Kalil struggled early in the 2017 season, receiving a 36.6 grade from Pro Football Focus that was one of the worst among starting left tackles.
He missed the 2018 season with a knee injury.
The release came shortly after the Panthers finalized the one-year, $6 million contract for tackle Daryl Williams to return. Williams graded out as one of the top right tackles in 2017 before missing most of the 2018 season with a knee injury.
Kalil's release likely means the Panthers will open offseason workouts with Williams at right tackle and 2017 second-round pick Taylor Moton at left tackle.
Moton opened the 2018 season at left tackle, but was moved to the right side after Williams was injured in the opener and veteran Chris Clark was signed to play the left side.
Moving on from Kalil doesn't mean the Panthers won't look at a left tackle with the 16th pick of the April draft, even though they have a big need for an edge rusher after future Hall of Fame defensive end Julius Peppers retired.
The release means the Panthers now have enough cap space -- estimated at $13.5 million based on calculations from ESPN's Roster Management and free-agent signings -- to potentially pursue former Kansas City linebacker Justin Houston or former Detroit defensive end Ezekiel Ansah.
Houston was released as the Chiefs transition from a 3-4 scheme to the 4-3. The Panthers are transitioning to a mix of 3-4 scheme with their traditional 4-3 under coach Ron Rivera.
Carolina released outside linebacker Thomas Davis prior to free agency, telling the 35-year-old Pro Bowl selection they were moving in another direction. Houston, 30, could help with that transition. He has 78.5 career sacks, including nine this past season, and is a four-time Pro Bowl selection.
Ansah, 29, has 48 career sacks since the Lions selected him with the No. 5 pick of the 2013 draft. He missed nine games last season, collecting four sacks in seven games.
Regardless, an edge rusher is a priority.
Panthers general manager Marty Hurney and defensive coordinator Eric Washington were at Clemson for pro day on Thursday. The Tigers have four defensive linemen -- Clelin Ferrell, Christian Wilkins, Dexter Lawrence and Austin Bryant -- who could go in the first round of the draft.
Ferrell and Bryant said they have official visits set up with the Panthers. Wilkins and Lawrence said they met with team officials at the NFL combine.
Ferrell and Bryant said their conversations with the team involved being able to play in a 3-4 and 4-3 scheme. Ferrell can play end in a 4-3 scheme and outside linebacker in a 3-4. Bryant can play end in a 4-3, end or tackle in a 3-4.
Wilkins and Lawrence also talked about position flexibility, saying they can play anywhere on the line.

Taylor, however, left the third game of the season against the Jets with a concussion, and Baker Mayfield took over and guided the Browns to their first win since Christmas Eve of 2017.
Mayfield never let go of the job, while Taylor threw just one pass the rest of the season -- an 11-yard completion on Nov. 4 while Mayfield was being checked for a concussion.
In three games, Taylor was sacked 13 times and went 42-for-85 for 473 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions (64.5 rating). He also earned $16 million -- $6 million in a roster bonus -- and was the Browns' most expensive player under the salary cap in 2018.
Taylor played better and longer in Buffalo, where he started 43 games in three seasons and completed 62.6 percent of his passes with 51 touchdowns and just 16 interceptions. He was the Bills' career leader in passer rating (92.5), and his 1,575 rushing yards are also the most in franchise history.

Jackson, 32, was a second-round draft choice of the Eagles in 2008 and spent his first six seasons in Philly, where he averaged 59 catches, more than 1,000 yards and five touchdowns per year. He was unceremoniously cut by coach Chip Kelly in March 2014 following a career year in which Jackson posted 1,332 receiving yards and nine touchdowns.
Nevertheless, Philly was his preferred destination, according to a source.
On Monday, Jackson took to social media to say goodbye to Tampa prior to reports of an agreed-upon trade.

Eli Manning, scheduled to earn an $11.5 million salary, a $500,000 workout bonus and a $5 million roster bonus if he is still on the roster at 4 p.m. ET this Saturday, won't be released by the Giants, sources said.
The Giants traded Beckham to the Cleveland Browns on Wednesday in a blockbuster deal that shook the league.

The trade paid dividends in the postseason, though, as Tate caught the game-deciding touchdown for a wild-card win against the Chicago Bears.
Tate, 30, plays mostly in the slot at this point in his career, and the Eagles are due to pay Nelson Agholor, another slot receiver, more than $9 million in 2019. With limited funds and needs in other areas, it didn't make much sense for the Eagles to double down on the inside.
Tate finished with 74 catches for 795 yards and four touchdowns in 15 games with the Lions and Eagles last season, and he also contributed on special teams as a punt returner. He had 90-plus catches in each of his previous four seasons with Detroit, surpassing 1,000 yards three times.
The second-round draft choice (60th overall) by the Seattle Seahawks out of Notre Dame in 2010, Tate has 611 receptions for 7,214 yards and 38 touchdowns in his nine-year NFL career.
In other free agent news, the Giants have an agreement in place on a one-year deal with outside linebacker Markus Golden, sources told ESPN's Jordan Raanan. He played under defensive coordinator James Bettcher in Arizona and had 12.5 sacks in 2016. He's looking to prove himself in his second season back from a torn ACL.

Thomas was involved in a crash on Feb. 16, a few days after he was released by the Texans. In a statement laying out the reasons for his arrest, police said Thomas was driving over 70 mph, more than twice the speed limit, at around 12:20 a.m. near downtown Denver when his SUV went off the road and flipped end-over-end, after hitting a median. The SUV landed on its wheels and one of his two passengers suffered serious injuries, the document said.
Thomas and the other passenger also were taken to the hospital after the crash.
Thomas' agent, Todd France, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from the AP.
Thomas played seven games for Houston last year, making 23 receptions for 275 yards and two touchdowns, before his season ended prematurely when he tore his left Achilles tendon.
For his nine pro seasons, Thomas has 688 catches for 9,330 yards with 62 touchdowns. He has made four Pro Bowls and won the Super Bowl following the 2015 season with the Broncos. The 31-year-old was a first-round pick by the Broncos in 2010 and spent his entire career there before last year's trade.

26243093,"New York Giants general manager Dave Gettleman took to the podium on Feb. 27 to address the media during the NFL combine. Someone asked about the rumors swirling around star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., whom the Giants signed to a five-year, $90 million extension in August 2018. ""We didn't sign Odell to trade him,"" Gettleman said. ""That's all I need to say about that.""
Thirteen days later, the Giants traded Beckham to the Cleveland Browns for first- and third-round picks and safety Jabrill Peppers. To my knowledge, nothing changed in those 13 days. Beckham appears to have all of his extremities intact. The NFL did not ban the forward pass. The Giants traded Olivier Vernon for Kevin Zeitler and let Landon Collins leave in free agency, but they didn't suddenly build a time machine and bring 1987 Jerry Rice through a portal and into Giants colors.

Browns get: WR Odell Beckham Jr.
Giants get: S Jabrill Peppers, No. 17 pick, No. 95 pick

Something dramatic and inexplicable needs to have happened in those 13 days to make this trade make sense because it otherwise reads as if the Giants were hacked. Months after paying him a $20 million signing bonus, they traded one of the league's best young players at any position to the Browns for the sort of offer the computer would reject in a video game.
This has the potential to be a franchise-resetting trade, the sort of deal that gets everyone fired and leaves fans muttering for decades about what could have been. The Giants have never had a player like OBJ before. Now, they don't have him -- or much of anything -- at all.
It's fair to say that Gettleman didn't inherit much when he took over as Giants GM in December 2017. Jerry Reese left the team after a string of horrific drafts, and while the Giants were able to paper over those holes by spending big in free agency to make the 2016 playoffs, regression then took hold, and they fell to 3-13.

Even given the fact that Reese left Gettleman with precious little in the cupboard, what Gettleman has done since is scarcely believable:
His 2018 free-agent haul was a disaster. Nate Solder, whom Gettleman made the highest-paid tackle in football, had the worst year of his career. Patrick Omameh, signed to a three-year, $15 million deal to play guard, was cut halfway into the season. Running back Jonathan Stewart, signed to a one-year, $3.5 million deal, touched the ball six times in three games before going on injured reserve.
The Giants used the second overall pick on running back Saquon Barkley, ignoring the simple concept of positional scarcity and passing on impactful players at more important positions such as Sam Darnold, Denzel Ward and Bradley Chubb. Barkley looked brilliant with the ball in his hands and made highlight-reel runs, but he was inefficient and racked up yards in garbage time. The Giants were 18th in rushing DVOA with their new star back but were left with holes or subpar players at most of the critical positions in their lineup.
In October, Gettleman traded former first-round pick Eli Apple to the Saints for fourth- and seventh-round picks. Apple almost immediately stepped into the starting lineup for New Orleans and helped turn around a struggling defense, which improved dramatically in the second half of the season. New York finished the season with veterans minimum corner B.W. Webb starting in Apple's place.
Earlier this month, Gettleman declined to put the franchise tag for safeties on Collins, which would have held the three-time Pro Bowler's rights for one more season at $11.2 million. Collins promptly signed a six-year, $84 million deal with Washington, which more realistically amounts to a three-year, $45 million pact with options. The $15 million annual figure and the rest of the safety market in free agency suggest that Collins would have held meaningful trade value if the Giants had held his rights.
The most bizarre path of all, though, is the one Gettleman has walked with his star wide receiver. After rumors that they were considering a Beckham trade last offseason, Gettleman signed OBJ to a massive extension in August. Beckham got a five-year, $90 million deal to stay in New York, with a $20 million signing bonus and $41 million guaranteed at signing. The $18 million annual average salary was the largest for a wideout in league history.
Less than a year after deciding they wanted Beckham, the Giants have decided he isn't part of their future. In doing so, they've burned all kinds of actual cash and cap space. Let's look at two scenarios. Scenario 1 is what would have happened if they hadn't given him a long-term deal and franchised him for 2019 before making the trade. (Remember, the Giants didn't use their franchise tag this offseason.) Scenario 2 is what actually happened.
Scenario 1: $8.5 million paid to Beckham in cash, $8.5 million on the Giants' 2019 cap, $0 in dead money on the 2019 cap
Scenario 2: $21.5 million paid to Beckham in cash, $5.5 million on the Giants' 2019 cap, $16 million in dead money on the 2019 cap
That's not a typo. Because Gettleman (or ownership) temporarily decided to keep Beckham around, the Giants paid an extra $13 million out of their coffers and will eat $16 million in dead money on this year's cap for the privilege of doing so. This isn't really a big competitive concern since the Giants don't appear to be particularly close to contending in 2019, but it's a sign of how shortsighted the franchise was in signing OBJ before giving things up seven months later.
In making this move and moving on from Collins and Vernon, Gettleman essentially wipes the slate clean of the Reese era and further builds the Giants in his image. As ESPN's Dan Graziano pointed out on Twitter, the Giants have one player left on their roster from Reese's first nine drafts as general manager from 2007 to '15, and that is long-snapper Zak DeOssie. The only other draftee left on the roster who precedes Reese's final two drafts is quarterback Eli Manning, who was technically acquired via a draft-day trade with the Chargers when Ernie Accorsi was general manager in 2004.
Manning is somehow still the quarterback, but trading Beckham cuts whatever's left of the 38-year-old's aging legs out from underneath him. Manning has been borderline passable with Beckham on the field since he entered the lineup in Week 5 of the 2014 season, but when the former LSU star has been injured or suspended, the QB has been limited to checkdowns and has been essentially unplayable:
Seventeen quarterbacks have thrown at least 2,000 passes in that time. Manning's marks without OBJ would put him 15th in completion percentage and last in both passer rating and yards per attempt. The only quarterback with a worse Total QBR in that span is Blake Bortles. The Giants will run out Sterling Shepard and Evan Engram, but in a draft that doesn't appear to have a stud wide receiver and a free-agent pool that doesn't have a No. 1 wideout, Manning is going to fire up the checkdown machine to Barkley.
The same trends hold true for New York's performance on the whole without Beckham in the lineup. There is certainly a subset of Giants fans who will suggest that Beckham has been cancerous to the team's chances of winning. That is not borne out by reality. When he has played the past five seasons, the Giants have gone 25-34 (.424). They've scored an average of 22.6 points and allowed 23.8 points per game.

From questions of ""what is going on?"" to claims of ""fake news,"" players are showing their surprise at New York's stunning trade of its star receiver to Cleveland.
Without OBJ, the Giants have gone 6-15 (.285). Their defense has been slightly worse, allowing 24.8 points per game, but their offense has shut down and scored a mere 18.5 points per contest. If you're making the argument that the Giants can finish last with or without Beckham, they certainly appear to have a much better shot of doing so without their star receiver.
It almost seems like a waste of time to explain how good he has been for the Giants. You've seen him play. I wrote about how great Beckham was before last season, and I noted that he was on a path that suggested he had about a 50-50 shot of making the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He missed four games in 2018 and did not make the Pro Bowl, which reduces his chances some, but we're talking about a 26-year-old whose performance record still points significantly toward a gold jacket in Canton. Ask the Raiders how they feel about trading away a player in that sort of class these days.
Because the Giants are eating the $20 million signing bonus on Beckham's deal, the Browns are getting a relative bargain as part of this contract. Cleveland essentially has OBJ signed on a five-year, $77 million pact with $19.5 million guaranteed, all but $2.75 million of which comes this season. From the Browns' perspective, his deal averages $15.4 million per season. He's owed $47 million over the next three seasons, which is less than Sammy Watkins -- an inferior wide receiver with far less of a track record -- received in unrestricted free agency last year.
This is a virtually impossible trade for the Browns to resist, even given that they handed Jarvis Landry a five-year, $75 million contract last offseason. Beckham and Landry are good friends going back to their days together at LSU and repeatedly tried to recruit each other on social media to come play for their respective teams. Now, they'll play together. They're going to each want the football, and this is a lot of money to devote to two wide receivers, but these two wideouts complement each other's skill set well and shouldn't experience any jealousy if the other has a big game.
While some will lump Beckham in with Antonio Brown as possible problem children for their respective new organizations, I wouldn't be so sure. As former teammate Geoff Schwartz pointed out on Twitter, Beckham was a hard worker who was beloved in the Giants' locker room. You might remember his teammates celebrating with a dance party after Beckham signed his extension in August. He gave an interview to ESPN in October in which he expressed frustration that the offense didn't allow for him to make big plays, but he hasn't skipped practice before key games. Unless there's a major off-field incident that isn't yet public record, this is not Brown redux.
It's clear that Beckham is getting a major upgrade in going from Manning to 2018 first overall pick Baker Mayfield, who excelled during the second half of last season. In the final eight games, Mayfield ranked sixth in passer rating (106.2), seventh in QBR (70.1) and second in yards per attempt (8.6). What has to be most exciting for OBJ, though, is that Mayfield consistently made plays downfield. He led the league with 34 completions on deep passes in that time, posting a 113.9 passer rating on those throws. In that same span, Manning posted an 81.4 passer rating on deep passes.
Suddenly, the Browns look as if they have one of the deepest skill-position groups in the league. The Browns ranked 13th in my weaponry rankings last season, but that was with Josh Gordon, Corey Coleman and Carlos Hyde playing key roles. All are gone.

Now, the Browns can start the season with Nick Chubb at running back. Kareem Hunt will surely be suspended for a good amount of the 2019 season, and the move to sign the former Chiefs back after he was cut for assaulting a woman in the Cleveland hotel where Hunt lived was abhorrent, but his talent is undeniable. The Browns also have Duke Johnson as a receiving back, though there are rumors he might become available in trade talks.
At receiver, the Browns are suddenly blessed with Beckham and Landry. You might prefer the Vikings' duo of Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs, and the Rams are deeper one through three, but nobody would fight you if you suggested that the Browns have the best duo of starting wideouts in football. Second-year receiver Antonio Callaway moves into a third wideout role, and he's going to spend all of 2019 facing single coverage. The Browns appeared to re-sign Breshad Perriman to a one-year deal earlier Tuesday, but after the Beckham deal came together, Perriman asked to be let out of his agreement and will sign a one-year contract with the Buccaneers. Throw in tight end David Njoku, who racked up 639 yards and four touchdowns as a sophomore, and the Browns have explosive receivers at every spot in the lineup.
This is the official end of the Browns' rebuilding period. For the first time in a decade, pressure will be on them to win regularly. The Ravens just lost four defensive starters, including star linebacker C.J. Mosley, though they added safety Earl Thomas on Wednesday. The Steelers traded Antonio Brown for a pair of midround picks and lost Le'Veon Bell in free agency. The Bengals nearly made it to the combine before they could find a defensive coordinator. After adding OBJ, trading for Olivier Vernon and signing Sheldon Richardson, the Browns have spent too much money and have too much talent to be happy with a 7-8-1 season again. Anything short of a playoff berth next season might qualify as a disappointment.
It's a totally new set of expectations, and while I'm sure Mayfield is happy to take on that challenge, teams don't always respond well. Look at the Jaguars, who ran to the playoffs in 2017, brought back their entire young core, blew out the Patriots in Week 2 last season and then totally collapsed. New coach Freddie Kitchens will have a lot of personalities to manage in his first season as a head coach.

This is yet another reminder of how valuable it is to find an effective quarterback on a rookie deal, which has been the cheat code for unlocking a playoff team under the current CBA since 2011. The Browns can afford to devote nearly $30 million of their cap to Beckham and Landry in 2019 because Mayfield has a cap hit of $7.4 million, which is less than one-third of the $23.2 million Manning will eat up on the Giants' cap this season. Manning's base salary of $11.5 million means he'll make $718,750 per game this season, which is more than Mayfield will make in base salary all season, at $570,000.
Browns GM John Dorsey will deservedly get credit for making this trade, but one of the reasons the Browns can make a trade such as this and send away two draft picks is that they amassed a massive amount of draft capital from 2016 to '17 under Sashi Brown. Brown certainly made his fair share of mistakes, and the comparisons between the former Jaguars executive and similarly doomed tanking magnate Sam Hinkie are grossly overstated, but if you want to make cross-sport comparisons, the Browns just traded for their Jimmy Butler.
When there are moves such as this in which the vast majority of public opinion seems to fall toward one side being correct, I like to at least consider the scenario in which the trade might work out for the unpopular side. I'm not doing that to be contrarian -- the Browns won this trade, and it isn't particularly close -- but I want to at least try to understand how the Giants might think they'll be able to win it. In the case of the Amari Cooper trade, while the Cowboys were initially lambasted in the media for giving up a first-round pick, their best-case scenario quickly came true.
Assuming there's no significant off-field incident that the Giants are covering up, they will move forward with a limited roster. Adding Peppers gives them a replacement for Collins, though Peppers' struggles in space when he played free safety as a rookie were more extreme than Collins' issues in coverage. Peppers hasn't been a great return man as a pro and hasn't exhibited the sort of takeaway skills Collins showed. Though Collins forced 11 takeaways in four seasons, Peppers has only two picks to show in two seasons with the Browns. Giants fans will appreciate having a born-and-raised New Jersey high school player back in the area, and Peppers will make just $3.2 million over the next two seasons, but he would have netted only a midround pick if the Browns had made Peppers available via trade this offseason.
The Giants will net the 17th and 95th picks with this trade; it has to be a disappointment that they couldn't convince the Browns to give them the better of their two third-round picks, and Gettleman will settle for the third-rounder the Patriots sent the Browns for Danny Shelton. By the Chase Stuart chart, those selections combine to something between the seventh and eighth overall pick in a typical draft. The traditional Jimmy Johnson chart is less impressed with midround picks and values the return as closer to the 15th overall pick.
Either way, the Giants have an extra first-round pick in the top half of this year's draft, and they get back a third-rounder after forfeiting their pick to take cornerback Sam Beal in the supplemental draft last season. (Beal missed the entire season because of a shoulder injury.) They turned their extra fourth-round pick from the Apple trade into a high fifth-rounder as part of the Olivier Vernon trade.
The Giants don't exactly have a draft bonanza the way the Browns did in years past or the Colts enjoyed last season, but the two first-rounders give them a lot of flexibility to move up. If they want to draft Dwayne Haskins before the Raiders come on the board at No. 4, they can move up from No. 6 to No. 2 without having to touch any future picks. The sixth and 15th picks are a nearly perfect swap on the Johnson chart for the second overall selection, and while the 49ers might have been positioned to draft Nick Bosa with that selection, they aren't as desperate to add edge rushing talent after trading for Dee Ford on Tuesday. The OBJ trade might also indicate that ownership has decided to rebuild the roster, a move that would make Manning even less essential.
If the Giants land Haskins, and he's a superstar, Giants fans will get over losing Beckham, just as Browns fans don't complain about missing out on Carson Wentz or Deshaun Watson anymore. There's also a possibility that Haskins simply falls to the Giants at No. 6, which would give them a chance to add immediate starters on both sides of the ball. Of course, even if they draft a quarterback, the Giants won't have a superstar receiver to make life easier for Haskins as he develops. (Gettleman and coach Pat Shurmur have said on record that they prefer taller quarterbacks, which would seem to rule out Kyler Murray, but given what Gettleman said about trading Beckham, it seems as if we shouldn't treat his public word as gospel.)
Adam Schefter reports that the Giants have traded Odell Beckham Jr. to the Browns for a first-round pick, a third-round pick and safety Jabrill Peppers.
On the other hand, while Gettleman's defense finished 24th in DVOA for the second consecutive season and is mostly bereft of young talent, the Giants now have three of the first 37 picks in a draft full of possible defensive stars. If he wants to build his team around running the ball with Barkley and a stout defense, this is his chance to add a significant influx of talent to the defensive side of the ball.
The Giants also will save significant money in future seasons as part of the trade, and though they don't have a ton of cap space, given their needs across the board, they can structure a deal with a low cap number in Year 1 before using the Beckham savings in future seasons. They still need a right tackle, and it wouldn't shock me if Gettleman went after former Panthers starter Daryl Williams to help solidify the weakest remaining spot on his offensive line.
It's hard to feel good about this trade if you're a Giants fan. Even in the best-case scenario, it will take years for the Giants to recover from this deal and reap the benefits of their pick. The Giants were often a frustrating team to watch with Beckham, who seemingly had to carry the offense to competence some weeks. They're going to be an even more frustrating team to watch without him.
In an offseason that has been full of big bets, nobody made a bigger one than Dave Gettleman did Tuesday. I don't think it's going to pay off.

26276459,"The deal is for $21 million and includes $10 million fully guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Callahan's 2018 season ended in December, when he broke his left foot in the Bears' 15-6 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in a Sunday night game.
Which teams have gotten free-agent bargains, and which teams have overpaid? Pro Football Focus uses its grading to evaluate the frenzy.
Who is still out there on the open market? Here are the top free agents looking for new homes, including pass-rusher Ezekiel Ansah.
Callahan, 27, emerged over the past three years as a valuable member of the Bears' secondary. He started 10 games last season, recording 45 tackles, two sacks, two interceptions and six pass breakups.
An undrafted free agent out of Rice in 2015, Callahan also picked off two passes in the 2017 season.
He received the 11th-best grade (81.4) among cornerbacks from Pro Football Focus last season.
ESPN's Jeff Dickerson contributed to this report.
"
26084782,"He is the first player to receive the franchise designation this offseason.
The 2019 franchise tag for punters and kickers is projected to be just more than $5 million on the one-year tender offer. That money would be fully guaranteed should Gould elect to sign it, and the two sides can continue working on a long-term deal until the July 15 deadline.
Robbie Gould has made 82 of 85 field goals (96.5 percent) over the past three seasons, the highest percentage in the NFL. He led the league in field goal percentage at 97.1 percent last season when he actually missed more extra points (two) than field goals (one).
Gould received the non-exclusive tag, meaning he can receive offers from other teams, but the 49ers can match any offer sheet he might sign.
Since 2009, half of the 12 kickers that have received the franchise tag then have gone on to sign new contracts with the team that tagged them.
Before tagging Gould, the 49ers attempted to work out a long-term contract with him. Lynch said at Senior Bowl in January that the team was ""hopeful"" it would be able to re-sign Gould and acknowledged talks had been underway.
""He's kicked unbelievably for us,"" Lynch said. ""He's been incredibly clutch for us. We'd like to reward him for that.""
But with the two sides unable to work out a deal, the Niners, who project to have more than $70 million in salary cap space, opted to use the tag in order to prevent Gould from leaving without a chance to match outside offers and/or receive compensation for him.
Gould is the first Niners player to be tagged since safety Dashon Goldson in 2012 and the first kicker the team has opted to give the designation since the tag's inception.
Based on Gould's productivity in two seasons with the team, it's no surprise the Niners elected to retain control of his rights.
San Francisco signed Gould to a two-year, $4 million contract via free agency after he'd converted all 10 of his field goals in 2016 for the New York Giants, where he resurfaced after being released by the Chicago Bears, where he'd spent the first 11 years of his career.
Gould quickly acclimated to the normally difficult kicking conditions at Levi's Stadium and has been the most accurate kicker in the league since. Over the past two seasons, he has made 72 of 75 field goal attempts, and his 96 percent conversion rate is tops in the NFL with only the Baltimore Ravens and Los Angeles Rams attempting more field goals in that time.
All of that was enough to easily make Gould the Niners' most important free agent in an offseason in which only a couple of fringe starters on offense and defense are set to hit the open market.
""Of course we want Robbie back,"" Shanahan said at the end of the season. ""He's been great for two years. It's nice for a coach, that ... I'm not thinking about him missing [kicks] at all.""
Shanahan's desire to keep Gould can be traced to previous teams he's coached in which kicking has been a serious issue. In two seasons with Houston (2008-09), the Texans made 76.9 percent of their field goal attempts, which ranked 28th in the NFL in that span. When Shanahan ran the Washington Redskins' offense, they converted just 75.8 percent of field goals from 2010 to 2013, the worst in the NFL in that period. In Shanahan's one year in charge of Cleveland Browns' offense, they were successful on just 78.1 percent of their attempts, also 28th in the NFL.
Combined, kickers on teams for which Shanahan called plays in his first seven years made 175 of 229 attempts -- a 76.4 percent conversion rate that would rank dead last in the NFL and well below the league average of 83.7 percent for those seven seasons.
The 49ers' decision to tag Gould comes after a couple of months in which it seemed a reunion with the Bears could be in the offing for the kicker, whose family lives in Chicago during the season while he has stayed at a hotel near the 49ers' facility.
While indicating he would be open to a Windy City reconciliation, Gould also expressed that staying in San Francisco would be a good thing.
""It's probably been the best two-year stretch I've had in my career, one of the best in the history of the game, and that happens with a lot of great people, right?"" Gould said after the season. ""... It just kind of worked since I've been here. And it's been pretty easy. So, the organization checks a lot of boxes for me.""

There are a ton of veteran safeties on the market, but Collins is the youngest, and age is a key data point in free-agent negotiations. And while he might not have elite one-on-one coverage skills, he has plenty of other playmaking attributes that have propelled him to three Pro Bowl nods. -- Seifert

Is Flowers one of the NFL's top pass-rushers? Probably not. But is he the best on the market? Quite possibly. Teams always pay for that ... and teams always need reliable pass-rushers. -- Seifert

2018 team: Chargers | Age: 27
Since the start of the 2016 season, Williams has averaged more yards per reception (15.9) than all but six pass-catchers in the NFL (minimum 43 catches). He might be the best big deep threat available. -- Seifert
2018 team: Patriots | Age: 26
You rarely find an available free agent capable of playing left tackle at a relatively high level. It isn't any easier in the draft. Brown demonstrated he could do that last season for the Patriots. -- Seifert
2018 team: Steelers | Age: 27
Bell held out all of last season to put himself in a position to get a precedent-setting contract that reflects his unique pass-catching skills. Even if he falls short, however, the expectation is that he will sign a deal that puts him in the upper echelon of running backs. -- Seifert
2018 team: Bears | Age: 27
Slot cornerbacks are valuable to a defense, and Callahan was one of the NFL's best last season. According to Pro Football Focus, opposing quarterbacks had a 78.9 passer rating when targeting Callahan in 2018, among the five lowest in the league. -- Seifert
2018 team: Eagles | Age: 25
A torn ACL in November will drive down his price. But assuming he recovers fully, Darby can be a pretty decent cover corner and playmaker. -- Seifert
2018 team: Chiefs | Age: 27
Injuries, most notably a concussion that cost him six games last season, will chip away Morse's price. Still, teams looking to elevate their offensive line can get a bigger bang for their buck by trying to upgrade at center than, say, left tackle. -- Seifert
2018 team: Packers | Age: 27
Last year at this time, Breeland was considered among the top cornerbacks on the market. A failed physical with the Panthers set him back and could continue to limit his price. If so, someone will get a good player at a key position without overstepping. -- Seifert
2018 team: Washington | Age: 26
A series of poorly timed injuries scuttled his contract year. With the number of creative offensive minds around the league, someone will find a way to maximize his considerable playmaking skills. -- Seifert
2018 team: Saints | Age: 26
With Joe Flacco headed to Denver and Nick Foles expected to land in Jacksonville, there just aren't a lot of landing spots for Bridgewater. He might have to go back to New Orleans, back up Drew Brees for another season and try again in 2020. -- Graziano
2018 team: Lions | Age: 30
Coming off a franchise-player season in which he missed nine games and collected just four sacks, Ansah will turn 30 next month and find it difficult to convince a team to invest in him long term. -- Graziano
2018 team: Jaguars/Rams | Age: 25
Fowler doesn't turn 25 until August, so he's in a different boat than Ansah. His issue is that he hasn't proved anything yet. The No. 3 pick in the 2015 draft missed his first season due to injury and has 16 total sacks in the three seasons since. -- Graziano
2018 team: Panthers | Age: 25
He had a chance to become Carolina's No. 1 receiver when the team traded Kelvin Benjamin in 2017, but he couldn't sustain enough production and has since been surpassed by more recent draft picks. There's still upside here. -- Graziano
2018 team: Rams | Age: 32
He just pocketed $15 million for one season with the Rams and likely moves on. It's not hard to imagine the still-productive Suh year-to-yearing it through the final portion of his career the way Darrelle Revis did and pocketing a boatload of money in the process. -- Graziano
Marcus Spears breaks down the impact Antonio Brown will have on another team, as he is expected to be traded by Friday.
2018 team: Patriots | Age: 26
Brown was seen as a top right tackle when he was with San Francisco. The Patriots traded for him, moved him to left tackle and won a Super Bowl. Now he'll get paid as a left tackle. But is he, really? -- Graziano
2018 team: Patriots | Age: 26
The beneficiary of all those teams franchising all those edge rushers. Flowers is the cream of the remaining crop and could clear $17 million a year on his next deal. The Patriots' former defensive coordinator is coaching the pass-rush-starved Lions -- just sayin'. -- Graziano
2018 team: Chargers | Age: 27
Went over Williams earlier, but he's all potential right now. Someone is going to sign him to be their No. 1 receiver, which means he'll get more than his production to date warrants. Will he live up to it? -- Graziano
2018 team: Broncos | Age: 29
Coming off an injury, but he's far and away the top center available. Any team with a need at the position will be interested, which will drive up his price. -- Graziano
2018 team: Dolphins | Age: 27
James might be only a right tackle, but it's a tackle-starved market and not a great draft for the position. James should clear eight figures on average in his next deal. -- Graziano
2018 team: Vikings | Age: 27
Barr is a very good player who will make some team's defense better. And it's entirely possible he lands a deal worth close to $12 million per year. But linebackers who don't rush the passer aren't generally valued too highly, and Barr could end up having to wait. -- Graziano
2018 team: Panthers | Age: 25
The receiver class isn't loaded, but even so, this is a player with a very specific skill set who might not be in demand until teams have their rosters a little more set than they are now. -- Graziano
With free agency right around the corner, NFL Nation assesses whether each team's top internal free agent will stay or go.
The NFL free-agency period is here. We rank the top 100 players to hit the open market, from Le'Veon Bell to depth defenders.
The Giants let one of their best players walk for virtually nothing. Teddy Bridgewater might not have a market. Here's what you should know.
2018 team: Rams | Age: 28
The flooded safety market could make life difficult for Joyner, whose 2017 season was better than his 2018 and who's coming off a year in which he made $11.287 million as the Rams' franchise player. -- Graziano
2018 team: Saints | Age: 29
If Ingram wants to take himself out on the market and look for a job where he's some team's No. 1 running back, I fear he'll be disappointed. If he wants to stay with the Saints for $4 million a year or so, he could sign sooner. That might be his top option. -- Graziano
2018 team: Lions/Eagles | Age: 31
Tate is coming off a down year by his own lofty standards. He could bounce back and be a great value signing for someone. Feels like a guy the Patriots snatch up once the first wave passes him by. -- Graziano
2018 team: Eagles | Age: 30
Foles learned in St. Louis how a career can spiral downward in the wrong environment. He is a good but not transcendent player who needs help to win. His reported destination in Jacksonville, where he is familiar with offensive coordinator John DeFilippo, seems like a good spot. -- Seifert
2018 team: Lions | Age: 30
Size, age and injury history dictate that Ansah will have to be a part-time player moving forward. If a team with a 4-3 scheme has the personnel flexibility to cover for him on most downs, Ansah could make a big impact as a situational pass-rusher. -- Seifert
2018 team: Cardinals | Age: 27
He isn't a conventional linebacker or safety, but Bucannon has a unique skill set that could be utilized by a team willing to think outside the box. The mistake would be trying to shoehorn him into a classically defined role. -- Seifert
2018 team: Patriots | Age: 28
Patterson is lights out when he gets the ball in space, as seen on kickoff returns in the earliest days of his career. But his success on offense needs creativity. You can throw him only so many bubble screens. The Patriots showed another alternative: traditional handoffs in the backfield. -- Seifert
2018 team: Vikings | Age: 27
Barr has never been used as a traditional pass-rusher, in part because he is fast enough to provide decent coverage and tackling in space. But a team that signs him thinking he can produce double-digit sacks might be overprojecting. -- Seifert
2018 team: Ravens | Age: 29
If a team needs a deep threat, it could do a lot worse than signing Brown. Even though he's relatively older, he ranked fourth in the NFL last season with an average of 17 yards per catch. -- Seifert
2018 team: Broncos | Age: 29
If you can't find a new left tackle to upgrade your struggling offense, the next-best place to turn is center. And Paradis is the best available. -- Seifert
2018 team: Buccaneers | Age: 26
Productive slot receivers make the world go 'round. Humphries is the kind of player you can pencil in for 70 receptions in just about every scheme NFL teams run. -- Seifert
2018 team: Steelers | Age: 27
His fresh legs alone, after a season-long holdout, should put Bell in position for an early-season impact. It will be fascinating -- in a good way -- to see how, or if, his game has changed. -- Seifert
2018 team: Texans | Age: 27
Of all the free-agent safeties available -- and there are many -- Mathieu and Earl Thomas have the best playmaking ability in the passing game. -- Seifert
2018 team: Seahawks | Age: 30
Did we forget about this guy? He's healthy, two months shy of 30 and was one of the best in the league at his position last season before he got hurt. There has been speculation around the league that Thomas will get more than $13 million a year on his new deal. Don't be surprised if he's patrolling the deep middle of the field for a Southern California contender. -- Graziano
2018 team: Chargers | Age: 27
In a thin wide-receiver market, the speedy, 6-foot-4 Williams wants to sell himself as a No. 1 wideout after being stuck down the Chargers' depth chart the past couple of years. He's going to convince someone, and he could end up making $12 million or more with a team that sees him as a potential No. 1. -- Graziano
2018 team: Eagles | Age: 25
He suffered a torn ACL in November, but he also just turned 25 and is expected to be ready for the start of the season. Multiple teams are prepared to pursue him, and Darby could end up with a price tag upward of $12 million per season. -- Graziano
2018 team: Falcons | Age: 26
Coleman is likely gone from Atlanta after several productive seasons as part of a tandem with Devonta Freeman. Is he ready to be someone's feature back? Is he the consolation prize for teams that don't get Le'Veon Bell? -- Graziano
2018 team: Rams | Age: 31
The Rams could end up needing to replace multiple players on an offensive line that has been a key factor in their success the past two seasons. Saffold looks bound for another team, and he should be the top guard on the market this offseason. -- Graziano
Current team: Chiefs | Age: 28
The Chiefs franchised Ford, who played outside rush linebacker in their 3-4 defense. But they're moving to a 4-3 front under new defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, and it's possible Ford won't fit. If some team wants to take a shot on a pass-rusher who had 13 sacks last season, the Chiefs might be open for business. -- Graziano
Current team: Buccaneers | Age: 32
The speedy veteran is scheduled to make $10 million this season. The Bucs are deep at receiver and would save that entire amount on their cap by cutting Jackson. But with receiver not a strong position in free agency this year, they could find a market for him. -- Graziano
Current team: Buccaneers | Age: 31
It's a new coaching staff and potentially a lot of change in Tampa. McCoy is a phenomenal player and a team leader, and Tampa Bay would have to be overwhelmed by an offer if it were going to move him. But he is signed for three more years at nearly $13 million a year, so who knows? -- Graziano
Current team: Eagles | Age: 26
The former first-round pick has been a very useful player for a very successful Eagles team the past two seasons. But there's a difference between ""very useful player"" and ""$9.4 million player."" That's what Agholor is scheduled to earn in his fifth-year-option season, and a 550 percent raise might be too much for the cap-strapped Eagles to handle. -- Graziano
Current team: Bills | Age: 25
His fifth-year-option season isn't until 2020, but that means an acquiring team could get a bargain in Year 1 and then decide later on Year 2. The talent is there, but the production hasn't been consistent. Every teams needs pass-rushers, and maybe the Bills can get something for this one. -- Graziano

The Jets have more than $100 million in cap space. But more important, they have a league-low $75.9 million in cash dedicated to 2019 contracts. That gives them maximum flexibility in the budgetary category that means the most to owners. -- Seifert
With a league-leading $106 million in cap space, the Colts can do pretty much whatever they want. But it's important to note that they have committed more than $115 million in 2019 contracts. They're still likely to seek high-level help -- safety Landon Collins is a rumored possibility -- but there will be some budgetary limitations. -- Seifert
While it has become cliché to project the Raiders to hit the maximum boundaries of silliness, the table is set for them to spend freely. They have plenty of holes and more than $70 million in cap space, among the top five figures in the league. -- Seifert
With nearly $70 million in cap space, the Niners have the ability to make a number of big signings. They tried to gird themselves against that pressure by giving matching six-year contracts to general manager John Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan, but the truth is, they have 4-12 and 6-10 seasons hanging over them and need to make a jump one way or the other. -- Seifert
Although they don't have much cap space at the moment, expected maneuverings will give the Eagles enough to make a handful of moves. History shows that general manager Howie Roseman isn't afraid to wade into the market. -- Seifert
You've heard all about the loaded defensive line class. Teams picking in the first half of the first round could play hardball with agents for guys like Trey Flowers and Dante Fowler Jr. by asserting that they can get a high-impact guy in the draft. And with players such as Nick Bosa, Quinnen Williams, Montez Sweat, Rashan Gary and others just having torn up the combine in Indianapolis, they could be right. -- Graziano
The free-agent tight end market is spotty. Jared Cook is coming off a big year. Always-injured Tyler Eifert is back again if you feel lucky. But the draft is stacked. Two Iowa tight ends -- T.J. Hockenson and Noah Fant -- could go in the first round, along with Alabama's Irv Smith Jr. And guys such as San Jose State's Josh Oliver, LSU's Foster Moreau and UCLA's Caleb Wilson starred in their combine workouts and could be strong Day 2 picks at the position. -- Graziano

There's no top-five, Saquon Barkley- or Ezekiel Elliott-style running back in this year's class, but there's intriguing depth and variety at the position. Teams always believe they can find starting running backs in the middle or late rounds, and they're usually right. So why stretch for a Mark Ingram when you might be able to get Iowa State's David Montgomery on Friday night? Or Washington's Myles Gaskin on Friday or Saturday? Oklahoma State's Justice Hill had the top 40-yard dash, vertical jump and broad jump of any back at the combine. The only other running back since 2003 with a 4.4-second 40 and a 40-inch vertical at the combine was Barkley. There's running back talent throughout this draft. -- Graziano
Conversely, evaluators don't seem to think this is a particularly stellar year for defensive backs in the draft. This might be why young free agents such as Ronald Darby and Landon Collins have stronger markets than they might have found in other years. Teams are still getting prime seasons with those players. -- Graziano
There might be a couple of tackles going early in the first round, but teams have some trepidation about the readiness of this year's draft linemen to step in right away and perform as reliable starters. Which is why free agents such as Trent Brown and Ja'Wuan James get paid as starting tackles. If there were a Tyron Smith or a Trent Williams in this group, things might be different. -- Graziano

Team needs are determined by research and analysis from ESPN Stats & Information. Cap-space figures are from Roster Management System databases as of March 6.

26276208,"Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
It's the third deal for Telesco while with the Chargers. Telesco, 46, signed a three-year contract extension before the start of the 2015 season that was due to expire at the end of this year. Telesco answers to John Spanos, director of football operations for the team, and son of Chargers chairman Dean Spanos.
Telesco joined the Chargers in January 2013. The Bolts have a 48-48 record during his tenure, making the playoffs twice, with a 2-2 mark in the postseason.
After the firing of Mike McCoy two years ago, Telesco was instrumental in the hiring of head coach Anthony Lynn, who has a 21-11 regular-season record in two seasons as head coach for the Chargers.
""With anything needed to help us win -- their answer is always yes,"" Telesco said about the Spanos family, owners of the team. ""It's even more than financial [resources]. It's about their time, their advice and support for all of us. It's critical for a winning team to have that, and we have that here.""

26247423,"The Supreme Judicial Court also scrapped the legal principle that wiped out Hernandez's conviction for future cases, calling it ""outdated and no longer consonant with the circumstances of contemporary life.""
Hernandez was convicted in 2015 of killing semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd. Two years later, the 27-year-old killed himself in his prison cell days after being acquitted of most charges in a separate double-murder case.
A judge threw out Hernandez's conviction that year, citing the legal principle that holds that a defendant convicted at trial who dies before an appeal is heard should no longer be considered guilty in the eyes of the law, thereby returning the case to its pretrial status.
Under the doctrine, rooted in centuries of English law, a conviction should not be considered final until an appeal can determine whether mistakes were made that deprived the defendant of a fair trial, legal experts say.
Prosecutors have said the legal doctrine is outdated and unfair to victims. Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn III argued the defendant's estate should be allowed to appeal the case, if they wish. Otherwise, the conviction should stand, he said.
""He goes through a full trial, a jury who speaks for the public convicts him and because he dies, in this case commits suicide, the whole thing is wiped out like it never happened? It's not fair or just and should be changed,"" Quinn told reporters after the November hearing.
Under the new rule laid out by the court, the conviction will stand, but the court record will note the conviction was neither affirmed nor reversed because the defendant died while the appeal was pending.
Other high-profile Massachusetts criminals whose convictions have been erased after their deaths include John Salvi, who was convicted of killing two abortion-clinic workers and wounding five other people during a shooting rampage in Brookline in 1994.
Roman Catholic priest John Geoghan, a key figure in the clergy sex abuse scandal that rocked the Boston archdiocese and spread across the globe, also had his child molestation conviction vacated after he was beaten to death in 2003 in his cell at the same Massachusetts maximum-security prison where Hernandez died.
Hernandez's attorney had previously argued the legal doctrine should remain intact, saying juries make mistakes.
How other states handle cases such as Hernandez's varies widely. Some states, such as Massachusetts, toss the convictions, while others dismiss the defendant's appeal and the conviction stands. Other states allow appellate courts to consider a dead defendant's case, prosecutors say.

26056293,"New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft is facing misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution charges, South Florida police said Friday. Let's take a closer look at what this story means.
Kraft is among more than 200 people, police say, who engaged in sex acts with employees of targeted massage parlors in South Florida. According to police, every person who will be charged was caught on videotape. Police said Kraft made two trips to the Orchids of Asia massage parlor in Jupiter, Florida, about one month ago, and thus faces two counts of the charge. Police said details about the charges against Kraft will not be released until next week.
Police in Florida say they have videotape of Patriots owner Robert Kraft paying for a sex act inside an illicit massage parlor in Florida.
No. A warrant will be issued, and his attorneys will be notified. In a statement, a spokesman for Kraft said he ""categorically"" denies ""any illegal activity.""
This case was part of a larger crackdown on a human trafficking ring in the South Florida region, police said. According to TCPalm.com, affidavits obtained last week indicated that employees at Orchids of Asia were living at the parlor and were trapped there as part of the trafficking ring. Many of them are from China, according to the report.
Updated on Feb. 25: The charges are punishable with up to one year in jail, a $5,000 fine and 100 hours of community service, according to Palm Beach County state attorney Dave Aronberg. The maximum discipline is higher than initially believed because Aronberg opted to charge Kraft with a first-degree misdemeanor.
Almost certainly not, but he is subject to NFL discipline on an individual level.
Everyone in the NFL, including owners, are subject to the league's personal conduct policy. The policy covers ""conduct by anyone in the league that is illegal, violent, dangerous, or irresponsible, puts innocent victims at risk, damages the reputation of others in the game, and undercuts public respect and support for the NFL,"" per its text. Owners and club or league management are held to higher standards under the policy and are ""subject to more significant discipline when violations ... occur.""
The league released this statement on Friday: ""The NFL is aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments.""
There isn't much precedent here, but most recently Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay was suspended six games and fined $500,000 in 2014. Irsay had been arrested on drug charges and ultimately pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Irsay also admitted to a judge that he was under the influence of the painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone. In 2010, Detroit Lions team president Tom Lewand was suspended for 30 days and fined $100,000 after a guilty plea to driving while impaired.
Lewand and Irsay pleaded guilty, but Kraft denies he broke the law.
That will be determined by the judicial process. But the NFL has made clear that guilty verdicts aren't required for league discipline. The policy states: ""It is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime. We are all held to a higher standard and must conduct ourselves in a way that is responsible, promotes the values of the NFL, and is lawful.""
In theory, yes.
Goodell has punished Kraft's Patriots more severely than any other franchise during his tenure. He fined them $250,000, and coach Bill Belichick $500,000, for spying on an opponent's defensive signals in 2007. In 2015, Goodell fined the Patriots $1 million, stripped them of two draft choices and suspended quarterback Tom Brady as part of the Deflategate investigation. Kraft threatened legal action against the league but eventually backed off.
That's getting a little ahead of ourselves, but the Patriots are a family-run business. Kraft's son Jonathan is the team president and presumed heir to the franchise.

26020410,"The NFL offseason is upon us. Most of the league has spent January thinking about what it's going to do in the player-acquisition period stretching through the end of April, and while the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams are a little behind the pack, I suspect they aren't too upset about having to catch up.
Over two weeks, I'm going to detail the first five moves I think every team should make this offseason. After hitting the NFC last week, I'm getting to the AFC this week. I'll start out West and finish with the Super Bowl champion Patriots in the East on Friday, as you can see from the schedule below:


Tuesday: AFC West
Wednesday: AFC South
Thursday: AFC North
Friday: AFC East
Last week: Five fixes for every NFC team
JUMP TO A TEAM:
AFC East: BUF | MIA | NE | NYJ
AFC North: BAL | CIN | CLE | PIT
AFC South: HOU | IND | JAX | TEN
AFC West: DEN | KC | LAC | OAK
NFC East: DAL | NYG | PHI | WSH
NFC North: CHI | DET | GB | MIN
NFC South: ATL | CAR | NO | TB
NFC West: ARI | LAR | SF | SEA
Let's finish the series in the AFC East, where the rest of the division continues what feels like an endless chase of the Patriots ...
1. Pick up the fifth-year option on Shaq Lawson. The former Clemson defensive end hasn't yet turned into the difference-maker Bills fans would have hoped for when the organization took him with the 19th pick of the 2016 draft, in part due to injuries. A hamstring problem kept him out of two games in September, but over the rest of the season, he quietly took a leap forward. Lawson produced four sacks, as he did in 2017, but his knockdown total leaped from five to 12 last season.
The only reasons to pass on a fifth-year option are if a player isn't worthy of a roster spot, or if he is such a significant health risk that the team is likely to end up paying him precious cap space for a season where he isn't able to pass a physical. Lawson doesn't fit either scenario, given how much room Buffalo is likely to have in 2020. With Jerry Hughes a free agent after this season, it should see in 2019 whether Lawson is a big part of the future.
2. Cut Chris Ivory and Russell Bodine. A pair of 2018 free-agent additions who had low expectations coming in and didn't exceed them, the Bills can do better in both spots. Ivory averaged 3.3 yards per carry as the backup to LeSean McCoy and is a replacement-level back at this point of his career. Bodine's spot at center already has been filled by Spencer Long, who signed a three-year, $12.6 million deal earlier this month. The team can free up about $4.5 million in cap space with these two cuts.

3. Add offensive-line help. The Bills have a trio of starters penciled in for 2019. Long is the center. Left guard Wyatt Teller flashed promise during his rookie campaign and seems likely to begin the season at that spot. Left tackle Dion Dawkins didn't build on his promising 2017 rookie season and allowed eight sacks, per Stats LLC. The second-year tackle also took a whopping 15 penalties, which was second in the league behind Washington tackle Morgan Moses. He saw four different holding penalties declined.
The Bills should be open-minded about adding help. Scouting reports coming out of Temple suggested that Dawkins might have to kick inside or move to right tackle at the pro level, and it could end up playing out that way. If the Bills see a left tackle prospect they love in the first round of April's draft -- they have the No. 9 pick -- or manage to sign someone like Trent Brown or Donovan Smith, moving Dawkins to right tackle could improve two positions.
As it is, they need to find at least one tackle and one guard, with John Miller and Jordan Mills both free agents. Jeremiah Sirles could fill one of those roles in a pinch, but he's likely better as a sixth or seventh lineman off the bench. Offensive coordinator Brian Daboll spent the 2017 season at Alabama, so it wouldn't be shocking to see the Bills lean toward adding Bama products Jonah Williams in Round 1 or Ross Pierschbacher later in the draft. With the Carolina brain trust of Sean McDermott and Brandon Beane running football operations, former Panthers right tackle Daryl Williams will also likely be on the team's radar.
4. And receiving help. The Bills cut Charles Clay and finally got out from under the ill-advised five-year, $38 million offer sheet former general manager Doug Whaley signed Clay to in 2015. That's the good news.
The bad news is that there really isn't much in the cupboard for quarterback Josh Allen. Undrafted rookie free agent Robert Foster impressed during the second half of the season, as the former Alabama backup racked up 511 receiving yards and three touchdowns over the final seven games. He'll be in the picture for snaps, although it's still way too early to pencil him in as a building block. Zay Jones improved in his second season and dramatically cut down his drops, but the 2017 second-rounder was still one of the least efficient wideouts in football.
It's possible Jones takes a leap forward or someone like Jason Croom harnesses his athleticism and becomes a starting-caliber tight end, but the Bills realistically need to come away from this offseason with a WR1 and a TE1. This isn't a great free-agent market for veteran receivers. They will have to wonder whether it's better to get Allen help at any cost, even if it means paying an exorbitant price for Chargers deep threat Tyrell Williams or former Lions and Eagles wideout Golden Tate. The easy math is to link Buffalo with another former Panthers wideout in Devin Funchess, who looked like a burgeoning star in 2017 before losing his role in Carolina's offense during the second half of 2018.
And again, at tight end, it'll be easy to glance toward Alabama star Irv Smith Jr. in the draft, but I would wonder whether he'll make it to Buffalo at pick No. 40. If the Bills want a veteran tight end, it's basically Jared Cook or bust; they could try to project more production from younger players such as C.J. Uzomah or Jesse James, but the draft is the more logical place to look for tight end help.
5. Draft a replacement for LeSean McCoy. The last bloated contract from the Whaley era on the books, McCoy's five-year, $40 million extension was the high-water mark for current running back deals before Todd Gurley signed his massive deal last offseason. McCoy was productive for a chunk of the deal and was one of the best backs in football in 2016, but the past two seasons have not gone well. Shady went from averaging 5.4 yards per carry during that 2016 campaign to 4.0 yards per rush in 2017. Then, in a 2018 season marred by injuries, the former Eagles star was down to 3.4 yards per attempt, with advanced metrics painting McCoy as one of the worst runners in football.

Buffalo can hope that a healthy McCoy has a bounce-back season. Even if that happens, though, he is a free agent in 2020, and he doesn't seem to fit Buffalo's rebuilding timeline around Allen. I don't think McCoy would have much trade value given his $6.2 million base salary, and the Bills don't have a real option to replace McCoy if they did move on from their veteran halfback, but they need to start thinking about 2020 options now. Buffalo has two picks in both the fourth and fifth rounds, and it wouldn't surprise me to see the team use at least one of those selections on a running back.
1. Pick up Laremy Tunsil's fifth-year option. The Dolphins were the beneficiaries of Tunsil's infamous draft-day slide, and while the photo tweeted from Tunsil's hacked Twitter account cost the Ole Miss left tackle millions of dollars, he's going to end up doing just fine in the long run. The Dolphins have an easy call in picking up Tunsil's fifth-year option, and they should get down to signing him to a long-term deal as early as this offseason.
2. Lean into the rebuild. Reports this offseason have suggested that Miami owner Stephen Ross wants to rebuild and reboot a roster that wasn't close to playoff contention. It's the right thing to do. The Dolphins have made too many mistakes in free agency over the past few years, either by overextending their own talent or spending premiums on players who weren't difference-makers. Nobody signed more deals that made absolutely no sense than Miami.
The rebuild should start by moving on from veterans who aren't going to help two or three years down the line. The Dolphins can gain $13 million in cap space by moving on from Andre Branch and Danny Amendola. They can add nearly $13 million more by cutting Robert Quinn, although I'd wait to see if there's some semblance of a trade market for the former Rams star.
It also means letting players leave who aren't going to help Miami's next playoff team. Frank Gore and Cameron Wake can still play, but Gore will be 36 in May and Wake is 37. William Hayes turns 34 this spring. Those guys should pursue a title somewhere else. Ja'Wuan James looked like he was on his way off the roster this time last year, but the 27-year-old had his best season as a pro in 2018. The Dolphins could justify bringing back the free-agent tackle.
3. Explore trade options for Kenny Stills and DeVante Parker. In a market lacking in wideout talent, Miami could have some options that interest other teams. Stills hasn't yet had the breakout season fans expected, but the four-year, $32 million deal the former Saints draftee signed before the 2017 season doesn't seem exorbitant given the resulting spike in wideout salaries. Stills has value on what amounts to a two-year, $15 million pact, and it wouldn't be shocking if a team looking for a deep threat was willing to part with a fourth-round pick for the 26-year-old.
Parker's market could be trickier. The 2015 first-round pick is set to play out his fifth-year option at $9.4 million, and while the Dolphins could afford to give him some run in a rebuilding season, it's clear they've grown exhausted of the Louisville product. Parker had his moments again in 2018, notably posting a 134-yard game against the Texans, but he remains injury-prone and inconsistent. He needs a fresh start, but he would need to take a pay cut to have any trade value.
4. Stay put in the draft and keep Ryan Tannehill until draft day (or beyond). As an example of Miami's shortsighted decision-making, it restructured Tannehill's deal before the 2018 season to create more than $11 million in cap space. If the team hadn't converted nearly $17 million of his salary into a bonus, it could cut Tannehill this offseason and owe just $2.3 million in dead money. Instead, it will owe $13.4 million in dead money for the quarterback, who missed five games in 2018 with a shoulder injury.

The Dolphins will likely look to the draft for a replacement, but that also will be difficult. Miami has the 13th overall pick, leaving the Dolphins behind teams such as the Raiders, Giants, Jaguars and Broncos, all of whom could be in line to draft a quarterback. There's no guarantee they will end up with the quarterback they want, and while they could trade up to get the passer of their dreams, this roster is in tatters. They need to be amassing extra draft picks, not moving up to grab one player.
The Dolphins should be in no rush to dump Tannehill. If they don't find the passer of their dreams in the draft, they should keep the 30-year-old for another season, given that the only other passers they have in the organization are sixth-rounder Luke Falk and Jake Rudock, who's on a futures deal. (If Miami wants to tank, it can always bench Tannehill midseason.) If the Dolphins land on Kyler Murray or Dwayne Haskins without having to give away a future first-round pick, they can safely move on from Tannehill and save the $18.7 million in base salary they owe him for 2019.
5. Re-sign Xavien Howard. If Tunsil is this team's building block on offense, Howard is the option it can build around on defense. Amid a trio of great corners in the AFC East with Howard, Stephon Gilmore and Tre'Davious White, the best guy in the division shifted from week to week. There were plenty of times it was Howard, who tied for the NFL lead with seven interceptions last season.
The former second-round pick is entering the final year of his rookie deal, and he already has admitted to hearing trade rumors. I don't get it. At 25, Howard still has plenty of years to go in his prime. Even if it takes the Dolphins three years to start looking like a contender, he will still be 28 and should be among the better corners in football. Unless someone wants to give them a franchise-tag-sized haul, Howard should remain in Miami for years to come.

Re-signing Howard could be expensive, but the Dolphins will have room if they start shedding veterans. It's not unreasonable to imagine him looking for something beyond the five-year, $75 million deal Josh Norman signed with Washington in 2016. Norman had a better pedigree when he left the Panthers, but the salary cap has risen from $155.2 million in 2016 to around $190 million in 2019.
1. Extend Tom Brady's deal. Let's start with an easy one. While Brady has notably taken less money than his peers over the years, his cap hold for 2019 is $27 million, which is the fifth largest in the league. It's also the final year of his deal, so if the future Hall of Famer really wants to play until he's 45, the Pats have some work to do. New England obviously doesn't want Brady to go anywhere, so a two-year extension would keep him around while creating cap room in 2019.
The exact terms of the extension all depend on what sort of discount Brady is willing to take, but the team could easily free up $6 million in space with a Brady deal. It could create another $11.2 million by cutting Dwayne Allen and Adrian Clayborn, which would get the Pats over $31 million in room, pending a possible retirement ...
2. Convince Rob Gronkowski to return (or get a very notable replacement). There's no replacing Gronk. It was telling that when New England finally moved the ball on offense in the Super Bowl, it was by going to 22 personnel and spreading out the Rams' base defense. Few teams in the NFL have tight ends capable of stretching the seams. The Patriots have one in Gronk. Few teams in the NFL have a tight end capable of looking like an extra offensive lineman in the blocking game. That's Gronk, too.
If they can't convince Gronkowski to return, it will free up $9.9 million more in cap room and push them over $40 million. Without Gronkowski, the Pats probably have to change their offensive style. They originally built their Brady offenses around Antowain Smith and Troy Brown before transitioning to the Corey Dillon and Deion Branch era. In 2007, they moved to the spread and imported Randy Moss, Wes Welker and Donte' Stallworth. When it was time to move on from Moss, they drafted Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez.
It's possible that the future is heavy doses of Sony Michel and power sets, with the Patriots taking advantage of teams moving toward smaller defenses and using the nickel as their base set. Maybe they'll trade up to grab T.J. Hockenson in Round 1 and turn the Iowa tight end into the next Gronk. I'd be skeptical.
With no Gronk, I wonder whether New England shifts its offense back toward the spread. It needs a great receiver on the outside to pull that off, and it just so happens that two of them might be available via trade this offseason. The Pats have to give serious consideration to trading for either Odell Beckham Jr. or Antonio Brown. Of the two, I would prefer Beckham, who's five years younger. Of course, Beckham also would cost more.
Even if it's not a receiver on the level of Beckham or Brown, expect the team to replace Gronkowski by making at least one meaningful addition to its receiving corps this offseason. It also could add a depth piece given that Phillip Dorsett, Chris Hogan and Cordarrelle Patterson are all free agents. Bill Belichick has tried to sign Emmanuel Sanders in the past, so it wouldn't be surprising if he went after Sanders in the hopes that the Broncos wideout will be ready for the second half of the season.
3. Let Trent Brown leave, and try to bring back Trey Flowers. Everything depends on the price, but New England has a much more obvious need at defensive end than it does at left tackle. Brown wasn't even guaranteed a starting job when he joined the Pats last year, but when first-round pick Isaiah Wynn tore his Achilles, Brown became the starter and excelled. Wynn should be ready for Week 1 next season, and with Marcus Cannon entrenched at right tackle, they probably can't realistically afford to compete with teams who want to pay Brown something in the $13 million range.
If the Pats lose Flowers, on the other hand, their edge rotation suddenly looks very thin. They could bring back John Simon and hold onto Clayborn in lieu of cutting the former Bucs end, but a Flowers-less team absolutely has to add a starting-caliber end to replace him. I'd argue that the Patriots should consider franchising Flowers, but they've developed a habit of letting their players hit the market before trusting that they'll get a shot at matching an offer. Belichick re-signed Devin McCourty and Dont'a Hightower that way, but it led to an outlandish offer on Nate Solder last year. I'd feel comfortable going to $14 million per year on Flowers, but I wonder whether that will be enough (or if Belichick feels the same way).
4. Add help on the defensive line. Regardless of what happens with Flowers, New England needs to increase its depth up front. Flowers and Simon are free agents on the edge, while Malcom Brown and Danny Shelton are both unrestricted on the interior. I would imagine the team probably has to bring in at least one run-stuffer. One pivot from Flowers would be to sign Ndamukong Suh, who would give Belichick the most impactful interior defender he has had since Vince Wilfork, but you know the Patriots will get somebody on a bargain deal who comes up with a big play in the postseason.

5. Find a punter. Ryan Allen is a free agent, and the Pats have generally been comfortable cycling through left-footed punters; they even brought in options to compete with Allen last offseason. It wouldn't be shocking to see them opt for a new solution. If so, Allen is leaving on a high, given how much work the 28-year-old ran through in Super Bowl LIII.
1. Bring back the special-teams stars. The Jets have a pair of special-teams Pro Bowlers in kicker Jason Myers and return man Andre Roberts, who are both free agents. With more than $100 million in cap space, New York should bring them back. Special-teams performance can be inconsistent from year to year, and I wouldn't count on Myers hitting more than 90 percent of his field goal attempts again in 2019, but what do the Jets have to lose?
They have plenty of other veteran free agents, but I wouldn't be desperate to bring most of them back. Morris Claiborne has been helpful and probably deserves a multiyear deal at this point. Henry Anderson looked good last season, racking up seven sacks and 16 quarterback knockdowns, but he might be a better fit in a 3-4 defense and hadn't been able to stay healthy before 2018. Josh McCown helped mentor Sam Darnold, but it might better to try to bring back the veteran passer as a coach as opposed to putting him in the line of fire under center.
Restricted free-agent wideout Robby Anderson will be a difficult situation to parse. I would imagine the Jets will tender Anderson at the second-round level, given the original-tender level would allow no compensation for the former undrafted free agent.
Do they want to commit to Anderson in the long term? Anderson has shown flashes where he looked like a viable starting wideout -- including 20 catches for 312 yards and three scores over a three-game stretch in December -- but the 25-year-old also can go missing for weeks at a time and has gone through myriad off-field issues during his career. The Jets also signed Quincy Enunwa to a four-year, $36 million extension off the strength of a season in which he averaged 40.8 receiving yards per game, which might have tipped their hand. I would wait to see what Anderson does in 2019 before making a decision.
2. Pick up Darron Lee's fifth-year option. The 2016 first-rounder had a rough couple of years to start his career, but 2018 was his best season as a pro. The Jets already are invested in one inside linebacker after signing Avery Williamson last offseason, and Lee was suspended for the final four games of the season after violating the NFL's substance abuse policy, but his fifth-year option seems relatively low-risk. The team also should be able to void Lee's guaranteed salary for 2019 and cut him if it wants to go in the opposite direction.
3. Sign Matt Paradis and upgrade the line. The Jets already cut Spencer Long after one season. James Carpenter is a free agent. They should be set at the other three spots with Kelvin Beachum and Brandon Shell at the tackles and Brian Winters at right guard, but they need to add help for Darnold on the interior.
If they're going after significant help, Paradis would be the most logical option. The only concern is that the 29-year-old center is coming off a fractured fibula, but while the injury cost Paradis the second half of the 2018 season, he should be healthy for Week 1 in 2019. New York also could make a run at Rodger Saffold if it wants to upgrade at guard, and it wouldn't be horrible if it tried to sign the two best interior linemen on the market given its cap space. Upgrading in the draft also makes sense.
4. Add a running back who isn't Le'Veon Bell. I think the Jets will end up with Bell, if only because all the pieces fit. They need a running back with Bilal Powell a free agent and Isaiah Crowell posting the second-worst success rate in football last season. They have nine figures of cap space and a general manager who is likely going to lose his job if they don't show serious signs of improvement next season. Gang Green plays in a huge media market and has antagonized fans by selling tickets without personal seat licenses in sections where fans previously had to pay for PSLs, leading to a 2018 lawsuit. Bell wins the offseason away from the Giants in a city where that matters.
There just isn't much evidence that the Steelers really missed Bell last season. In 2017, he averaged 4.0 yards per carry and converted 23.1 percent of his carries into first downs. Last season, James Conner replaced Bell and averaged 4.5 yards per carry while turning 26 percent of his runs into first downs. Bell offered more as a receiver, of course, but the idea that he's a No. 2 wideout isn't realistic.
The Steelers threw the ball more frequently and turned the ball over more often, but they jumped from eighth in points per game in 2017 to sixth last season. They fell from third to sixth in offensive DVOA, but both moves are well within the random variance between years we would see from teams who don't make any changes at all. It's very difficult to make a case that the Steelers were notably worse when replacing Bell with a midround draft pick.
That's the performance argument, and it's even before addressing Bell's track record of missing time, either via injury or suspension. Bell missed 18 games during his first five seasons in the league, which doesn't include his full-season holdout in 2018. One of those games was a Week 17 respite, but Bell also missed Pittsburgh's postseason games in 2014 and 2015. Availability is a legitimate concern with Bell.
At the right price, the Jets should be interested in Bell, but that number shouldn't be anywhere near the $15 million annual average salary that has come up over the past couple of seasons. The Jets could very well justify adding a back, but they're much better off going for a lower-cost option like Tevin Coleman or Spencer Ware.
5. Trade down in the first round. The Jets have the No. 3 overall pick in the draft and need help in their front seven to supplement star end Leonard Williams. At that third spot, they're assured of adding either massive Alabama tackle Quinnen Williams, who might be the best player in the draft independent of position, or one of a pair of edge rushers in Nick Bosa and Josh Allen. Nobody would fault the Jets for taking any of those three players.
I don't think it's the best move, though, especially in a draft full of front-seven talent. New York needs extra picks, especially after trading its first-rounder and three second-rounders to get the third overall pick and draft Darnold last year. One of those second-rounders is the 34th pick in this year's draft, which is going to the Colts.
There's also a lack of homegrown talent on this roster. Assuming Powell and Dakota Dozier leave this offseason, the Jets will have three players left from their six drafts between 2010 and 2015: Winters, Enunwa and Leonard Williams. They have a lot of cap room, but they can't build this entire team upon free agents and undrafted guys.


At pick No. 3, the Jets are also in a great spot to market to teams looking to grab a quarterback like Dwayne Haskins, given that they pick ahead of the Raiders (No. 4), Giants (No. 6), and Jaguars (No. 7). The Cardinals and 49ers aren't taking a quarterback at pick Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, and while they could both consider trading down from their perches, the Jets could have a real opportunity when their pick pops up on April 25 in Nashville, Tennessee. They should be actively creating a market for their selection, and if Haskins (or Kyler Murray) is still on the board at 3, the Jets should trade their pick to the highest bidder.
Let's move on to the AFC North, where the Browns are having the most stable offseason for the first time in, oh, 30 years or so. The Ravens are replacing general manager Ozzie Newsome and just traded Joe Flacco, the Bengals still haven't found a defensive coordinator, and the Steelers are dealing with a miffed wide receiver. You might have heard.
Let's begin in Baltimore, where new GM Eric DeCosta has work to do ...
1. Re-sign C.J. Mosley and make tough choices at linebacker. Mosley has made four Pro Bowls over his first five seasons in Baltimore and has missed only three games. About the worst thing you could say about the Alabama product is that he isn't Ray Lewis, but that's an unfair bar, even for a Ravens inside linebacker. Eleven linebackers since 1970 who are Hall of Fame-eligible made it to at least four Pro Bowls in five seasons. Seven of those guys went to Canton, and when they become eligible, Patrick Willis and DeMarcus Ware will join the list. Mosley is in good company.
Could the Ravens use the franchise tag on Mosley? Yes, but it wouldn't be ideal. The league has only one franchise tag for linebackers, and because pass-rushing outside linebackers make so much more than inside linebackers, it serves to essentially rule out franchising interior linebackers. The tag for 2019 is projected to come in at $15.5 million per season, but there are only two inside linebackers in the league -- Jamie Collins and Luke Kuechly -- who have multiyear deals for more than $12 million annually.
Mosley should be in line for a huge deal. One year after an offseason in which Anthony Hitchens got five years and $45 million in free agency and Eric Kendricks picked up five years and $50 million before entering the final year of his contract, the Ravens are looking at something closer to $13 million per season for Mosley. Even given that inside linebackers generally don't get paid huge money, I don't see how you can let a player like him leave.
Signing Mosley could mean the Ravens will have to let edge rusher Za'Darius Smith leave in free agency, but I might be more willing to consider that possibility. Smith had a career year and led the team in both sacks (8.5) and knockdowns (25), but the 26-year-old racked up a total of 10 sacks over his first three NFL seasons.
Smith's 16 knockdowns in 2017 hinted at a possible breakout in 2018, and he's probably going to be a useful pass-rusher elsewhere, but his situation is a little reminiscent of Pernell McPhee. The similarly sized Ravens pass-rusher racked up 9.5 sacks over his first three seasons, then posted a 7.5-sack, 26-knockdown season in his contract year in 2014. The Bears signed McPhee to a five-year, $38.8 million deal in 2015, but injuries dragged down McPhee's career in Chicago, and the Ravens didn't skip a beat without him.
Those teams had Terrell Suggs, of course, and the future Hall of Famer is set to be a free agent after 16 seasons with the Ravens. Suggs has suggested he wants to play in 2019, so the ball is in Baltimore's court.
Suggs played 71.9 percent of Baltimore's snaps last season and racked up seven sacks, so he can still go. This is a great draft class for edge rushers, so the Ravens might use a pick or two on drafting Suggs' eventual replacement. They should still bring back T-Sizzle on a one-year deal in the $5 million range.
2. Tender Michael Pierce and Patrick Onwuasor, and work on a deal with Matt Judon. Pierce and Onwuasor, both restricted free agents, are going to attract attention from other teams. Baltimore will likely place second-round tenders on them, although it might even be tempted to place a first-rounder on the 340-pound Pierce, who is a valuable part of their defensive line rotation. DeCosta also has to think about a new deal for Judon, who is entering the final year of his rookie deal in 2019.
Much of what happens with these three young defenders could depend on what else goes down this offseason. Onwuasor was a college safety who has successfully converted to inside linebacker, and he flashed with big plays throughout the year before winning Defensive Player of the Week in Week 16. If the Ravens re-sign Mosley, they'll probably let Onwuasor move on after this season and go forward with Mosley and 2018 second-rounder Kenny Young on the interior; if Mosley leaves, they will have to give re-signing Onwuasor more thought.
Likewise, on the edge, the Ravens probably have to choose between Smith and Judon given their spending elsewhere on defense. I'd lean toward the latter, who has been more consistently productive throughout his career. Judon has 19 sacks and 49 knockdowns through three seasons, along with 10 tackles for loss against the run over the past two seasons. Smith had two over that same time frame.
Pierce, meanwhile, could be subject to other moves. Baltimore gave nose tackle Brandon Williams a five-year, $52.5 million deal in March 2017, which is a huge contract for someone who rarely gets after the quarterback. Defensive end Brent Urban just completed his best season as a pro and is now a free agent, and the Ravens might choose to lock him up instead. Pierce is a valuable player, but the Ravens probably can't pay Williams and Pierce what they're worth at the same time.
3. Extend Justin Tucker. It's difficult to imagine the Ravens without their star kicker, who has spent his career bailing out below-average offenses with field goal after field goal. To say that Tucker has been the league's best kicker since entering the NFL sells things short. By Football Outsiders' special teams statistics, which adjust for kick distance and game location, the top-ranked Ravens have been so dominant on points of field position gained by scoring kicks since 2012 (86.1) that the second-place Patriots (43.7) are closer to 16th than they are to first.
Baltimore could move on from Tucker and trust that it can find the next guy as an undrafted free agent, but with a young quarterback in Lamar Jackson, Tucker is going to give the team a valuable safety net for years to come. The Ravens could wait until next season and then use the franchise tag to help negotiate, but Baltimore might end up using the tag to keep around one of their free-agent defenders. A new Tucker deal should reset the kicker market at somewhere around $6 million per season. Imagine what the Bucs or Chargers would be willing to pay for Tucker if he hit the free market.
4. Cut one veteran cornerback. The Ravens are set at one spot with Marlon Humphrey, who took a huge step forward in his second pro season. Their other cornerbacks are in question. After trading Flacco, Baltimore's largest cap hit belongs to Jimmy Smith, who missed nine games combined in 2016 and '17 with injuries before sitting out the first four games of 2018 with a suspension. The 30-year-old has a $15.9 million cap hit, the second largest for any corner in football, and the team could free up $9.5 million in room by cutting the 2011 first-round pick.
Likewise, Baltimore has to decide whether it wants to pick up the 2019 option for 32-year-old Brandon Carr, which carries a $7 million cap hit. He played 84.6 percent of the defensive snaps last season, but Humphrey and Smith were Baltimore's top two corners by the time the team got to the postseason.
This might come down to whether the Ravens can convince Smith to take a pay cut. The Colorado product has a $9.5 million base salary in the final year of his deal, and while he would attract interest on the free-agent market, I don't think any team would give Smith that sort of money. If they can extend Smith for a couple of years and bring down his overall compensation to a cap hit in the $10 million range, they would be smart to keep Smith and move on from Carr. At their current cap hits, I think Baltimore would part ways with Smith and keep Carr.
The Ravens could also theoretically cut 34-year-old safety Eric Weddle, who is entering the final year of his four-year, $26 million deal, but Weddle's experience and instincts still make him a valuable defender. It wouldn't be a surprise to see Baltimore draft a free safety in April to take over for Weddle in 2020.

5. Sign Tyrod Taylor. Taylor makes all the sense in the world as the backup for Jackson, given that Baltimore's sixth-round pick in the 2011 draft had his most significant pro success as the starting quarterback under current Ravens offensive coordinator Greg Roman when the two were in Buffalo. Taylor already knows Baltimore's offense, and if Jackson were to get hurt, the Virginia Tech product could step in without skipping a beat.
1. Hire a defensive coordinator. While new coach Zac Taylor doesn't seem particularly concerned that candidates such as Todd Grantham and Jeff Hafley have decided to stay in school, the Bengals might be heading all the way to the combine without a defensive coordinator. Teams with established defensive minds as head coaches such as the Patriots have gone for stretches of time without a defensive coordinator, but Taylor has been an offensive coach his entire career. The Bengals have to hire somebody and figure out what their defensive identity is going to be in 2019 sooner rather than later. Note: Cincinnati has hired Giants defensive backs coach Lou Anarumo as its defensive coordinator.
2. Pick up William Jackson's fifth-year option. Jackson wasn't quite the revelation he was during the 2017 campaign, but he's comfortably Cincinnati's best cornerback and is likely to be extended next offseason.
3. Cut Vontaze Burfict. The Arizona State product hasn't played a full 16-game season in five years, having missed 37 of Cincinnati's 80 games thanks to various injuries and suspensions. Burfict isn't playing at a high level when healthy, and his propensity for inexplicably dirty play makes him a liability to cost his team a stop on every single series. The end of the Marvin Lewis era should make for a good time to end Burfict's run in Cincinnati, too.
4. Address right tackle and tight end. The Bengals might have thought they had these positions figured out at one point with Cedric Ogbuehi and Tyler Eifert, but Ogbuehi never played like a competent NFL lineman, and Eifert wasn't able to stay healthy. Both are free agents and unlikely to return, as are replacements Bobby Hart, Tyler Kroft and C.J. Uzomah.
This is where I would start running down free-agent possibilities, but the Bengals aren't going to meaningfully invest in unrestricted free agency, so it's not worth wasting your time. They are going to add players via the draft and through the occasional low-cost free-agent addition, because that's what they've done for years. It's possible that things will change under Taylor, but I suspect this is a call by owner Mike Brown.
Will Dallas extend the contracts for three stars? What will Philly do with Nick Foles? Let's make offseason moves for the NFC East.
One signing or trade can dictate several more moves. Let's lay out destinations for seven potential free agents, then predict what comes next.
So long, 2018 season. It's never too early to look ahead to 2019. Our crew of insiders weighs in on the biggest topics of the offseason.
5. Extend A.J. Green. One thing the Bengals generally do is retain their top homegrown talent, and Green is on pace to become one of the best draft picks in franchise history. The former Georgia star played just 17 snaps during the second half of the season because of a toe injury, but if the Bengals are too cheap to give the 30-year-old Green an extension, they shouldn't bother showing up to play after 2019.
Finding the right terms on a Green extension, however, could be interesting. Green is forever linked to 2011 classmate Julio Jones, who was chosen by the Falcons two picks after Cincinnati chose Green. When the two started to negotiate extensions in 2015, both organizations seemed to wait for the other to make a move. Finally at the end of August, Jones signed a five-year, $71.3 million deal with $47 million due over Years 1-3. Two weeks later, Green inked a four-year, $60 million extension that netted him $47.3 million over Years 1-3. Those two numbers might be related.

Jones still has two years left on his deal, but the Falcons have suggested they're going to break from their usual protocol and give Jones a new contract this offseason. That sets up for another offseason stare-down. We know both Green and Jones are going to get paid; it wouldn't be a surprise to see them both top the five-year, $90 million extension Odell Beckham Jr. signed with the Giants last offseason. The question is who signs first, because whoever doesn't blink is going to pick up a little bit of extra cash for their patience.
1. Lock up Damarious Randall and Joe Schobert. The Browns don't have any free agents who would justify the franchise tag, but they have a pair of key contributors hitting free agency next season in Randall and Schobert, two building blocks for the defense. They're both every-down contributors when healthy, and with $78.6 million in cap space, there's no reason for GM John Dorsey to delay locking up the heart of his defense for years to come.
If the Browns want to clear up cash, they could cut Jamie Collins, who doesn't play in nickel packages when Schobert and Christian Kirksey are healthy. Releasing Collins would save $10.5 million in cash and create $9.3 million in cap space. The Browns could insert Genard Avery, who flashed as a fifth-round pick, into the starting lineup for Collins.
2. Go after Trent Brown. After losing future Hall of Famer Joe Thomas to retirement, the Browns started the year with undrafted free agent Desmond Harrison at left tackle. Harrison struggled during the first half of the season, was scratched with an illness before Week 9, and didn't play another snap the rest of the way. They turned to former Rams tackle Greg Robinson, who delivered the best half-year of his pro career. Stats LLC suggests he didn't allow a single sack in his eight starts, although the 2014 second overall pick did commit six holding penalties.
Should the Browns bring back Robinson? Sure, if the price is right. Should they stop there? Absolutely not. They have the cap space to go after the best tackle on the market, and that's Brown, the Patriots left tackle who was impressive in his first season on the left side after starting his career as a right tackle for the 49ers. The 6-foot-8, 380-pound Brown certainly has the size to play on the blind side, and if Cleveland is going to invest serious money anywhere, left tackle makes the most sense. Dorsey, who used his first selection as a GM to draft Eric Fisher with the first overall pick for the Chiefs, isn't going to ignore the line.
3. Add another edge rusher. The Browns have an absolute stud in Myles Garrett. After that, things get murkier. Larry Ogunjobi has flashed as a promising interior disruptor, although he slowed down as last season went on. Avery racked up 4.5 sacks and 14 quarterback knockdowns, but nobody else topped four sacks or eight knockdowns last season. Emmanuel Ogbah looked like he might be a future difference-maker as a rookie, but the 2016 second-rounder has just seven sacks and 13 knockdowns over 24 subsequent starts, missing time with a broken foot and an ankle injury.
The Browns could use a second pass-rusher to play across from Garrett and scare opposing offensive coordinators. I think the Chiefs are likely to cut Justin Houston, and it might make sense for him to be reunited with Dorsey, even if new defensive coordinator Steve Wilks will be running a 4-3 as his base defense in Cleveland. The Browns ranked 25th against the run last season, so they might also look for a solid two-way veteran like Brandon Graham of the Eagles. Dorsey has four top-100 picks in a draft full of edge help, so it wouldn't shock me if the team invested one of its top selections in a defensive end.
4. Find help next to Ogunjobi. I want the Browns to sign Ndamukong Suh. They need someone who can punish opposing teams for doubling Garrett and have $71 million in cap space. Suh is 32, but the Nebraska product hasn't missed a game to injury in his career. He has been a steady interior presence, and this might be his last chance at getting a multiyear deal. A three-year, $45 million deal with $30 million in guarantees could make both sides happy. Also, it would make me happy.

5. Sign a deep threat. The core of Baker Mayfield's receiving corps is set with Jarvis Landry and David Njoku. Antonio Callaway fell in the draft because of many serious off-field concerns, but he appeared to stay on the straight and narrow during his rookie season. The 21-year-old was stretched as a No. 2 wideout in 2019, and while he still has plenty of time to develop, the Browns started to carve out a role in the second half for Ravens castoff Breshad Perriman, whose speed stretched opposing defenses.
Cleveland could choose to bring back the free-agent Perriman, but it has room to upgrade and find a more consistent deep threat to serve as a contrast to Landry's short and intermediate work. Dorsey traded a draft pick to the Dolphins to acquire Landry, and you wonder whether he might go back to Miami to make a move for Kenny Stills, who wouldn't have much utility on a rebuilding Dolphins team. Cleveland also could make a move in free agency for John Brown, who was impressive in the first half with the Ravens in 2018.
1. Trade Antonio Brown for talent that will help the team now. Whew. Let's get started. When the Brown trade rumors started after the end of the regular season, I looked at the money and pointed out that a trade didn't make sense from Pittsburgh's perspective. The Steelers would save cash by trading away Brown, but $12 million shouldn't matter to a multibillion-dollar business.
The simple math, essentially, is this: Pittsburgh will owe a minimum of $21.1 million on its cap for Brown in 2019. The calculus for the cap hit changes depending on what it does:
Cut or trade Brown before March 17: $21.1 million
Keep Brown: $22.2 million
Cut or trade Brown between March 17 and June 1: $23.6 million
Cut or trade Brown after June 1: $9.5 million in 2019, $14.1 million in 2020 (total of $23.6 million)
These numbers are all within $2.5 million of one another. Under these circumstances -- a player as talented as Brown, still well within the prime (if not the peak) of his career, playing for a team that doesn't have a huge salary-cap problem -- teams simply don't part ways with superstars, certainly not when the difference between them playing and leaving amounts to less than 1.5 percent of the salary cap.
And then Brown went on Twitter. It was one thing when it looked like the Steelers were merely sick of his antics; now it's quite clear he's sick of Pittsburgh, too. I still think the best move for all parties is to work out things, but the chances of that happening seem to fluctuate wildly from week to week.
Even given his social media chatter, Brown is going to have significant trade value. He's on a three-year, $38.9 million deal, and while he might want his new team to guarantee some of that money, just under $13 million per season is a bargain for someone with his talent. The Steelers could justifiably ask for a late first-round pick (or similar value via a pick swap) in return for Brown, although the public discontent between the two sides has unquestionably reduced Pittsburgh's leverage.
Where should the Steelers send Brown? If the Pittsburgh brain trust really believes he is disruptive and going to hurt the chemistry of his new team, the Steelers should be happy to send him within their division. In reality, they know that Brown's talents outweigh his occasional attitude issues, which is why GM Kevin Colbert will want to deal him outside the AFC North. I don't think the Steelers should send Brown to the Patriots for reasons I would imagine to be obvious.
Instead, if the Steelers are going to trade Brown, they need to focus on acquiring young talent that is going to help them in the next two to three years, during what would presumably be the final seasons of Ben Roethlisberger's career. They could use a first-round pick to target Roethlisberger's replacement -- there's also a particularly juicy idea of trading Brown to the Cardinals for Josh Rosen and a midround pick, with the Cardinals then using the first overall pick on Kyler Murray -- but one of the reasons to keep Brown was to try to maximize Pittsburgh's chances of winning one more Super Bowl during the tail end of Roethlisberger's career.
Pittsburgh's biggest need is at cornerback, which leaves it with a few teams that might make sense. The Bills need wideout help for Josh Allen and have Tre'Davious White, who is a genuine star at corner, but the Bills would rightly want more for a cornerback who is still just 24. The Dolphins have Xavien Howard, who said he had been the subject of trade talk, but a rebuilding Miami team has no need for a 30-year-old wideout. The Titans are three-deep at corner with Adoree' Jackson, Logan Ryan and Malcolm Butler, but Butler hasn't looked like his old self since 2016, and Ryan is in the final year of his contract. The Broncos could dangle Chris Harris Jr., but the 29-year-old corner is entering the final year of his deal, too. And that's just the AFC.
In lieu of merely looking for draft picks, the Steelers should try to get a starting cornerback and/or a young wideout as part of a Brown package.
2. Don't tag Le'Veon Bell. Isn't it incredible that Bell has essentially become an afterthought in light of the Brown story? The Steelers have seemingly gone back and forth on using the transition tag to temporarily keep their star running back, only for Colbert to announce on Wednesday that the Steelers will not use a tag and will let Bell hit unrestricted free agency.
It's the right move. We originally figured that the Steelers were going to let Bell leave without a transition tag because it would make Bell eligible for the compensatory formula; if the Steelers didn't make any major signings in free agency, losing Bell would have likely netted them a third-round compensatory pick in the 2020 draft.
Putting the transition tag on him would only make sense, then, if the Steelers didn't think they were going to get a compensatory pick. It would stand to reason that they would put the transition tag on Bell because they expect to be players in free agency and sign someone whose price tag would cancel out the compensatory pick for Bell. Colbert's comment that the team ""can't afford"" to use the tag suggests they won't be going heavily into free agency, which is in line with what they typically do.
3. Add a cornerback. Corner was a mess for this team in 2018. Joe Haden was sound on one side, and Mike Hilton is a competent slot corner, but former first-round pick Artie Burns was a disaster from Week 1 on before being benched in Week 6. He played just 12 defensive snaps over the final 10 games of the season. The Steelers have a tough decision coming with Burns' fifth-year option, and while I think it makes sense to pick it up, this is the same organization that just had to pay Ryan Shazier's fifth-year option for a season in which the star linebacker wasn't physically able to play.
The Steelers will have to decide whether they want to move forward with Burns. Coty Sensabaugh filled in as the starter, and Pittsburgh gave a handful of snaps per game to 2017 third-rounder Cameron Sutton, although he also sat out most of the second half of the season. Sensabaugh is a free agent, and they can upgrade on him if they don't want to hand the job back to Burns.
I pitched a Burns-for-Trae Waynes trade in the Vikings offseason section, and I think that could make sense for both sides. Using Burns as possible trade bait for a veteran cornerback is plausible, although the Steelers could also keep Burns and sign a free agent to compete with him. Pittsburgh could be in for Jimmy Smith if the Ravens make their veteran corner a cap casualty, and the top of the free-agent market will have cornerbacks such as Bradley Roby, Kareem Jackson and Ronald Darby. Pittsburgh would probably prefer to target someone who is cut, like Smith, to keep intact its compensatory pick for Bell.
Dan Orlovsky breaks down whether Le'Veon Bell would fit better for Houston or Green Bay.
4. Extend Roethlisberger. He is in the final year of his extension, and just as is the case with Philip Rivers, it looks like the 36-year-old has a couple of seasons left playing at a high level. I suggested that the Chargers give Rivers a two-year, $54 million deal, and Roethlisberger's new deal should be in the same ballpark.
5. Add help at inside linebacker. With Shazier's future still uncertain, Pittsburgh struggled to find a solution to stop opposing passing games last season. The likes of Jon Bostic and L.J. Fort weren't able to hold up, as the defense ranked 31st in DVOA against throws to tight ends last season. Vince Williams will stick at one spot, but the Steelers desperately need to add somebody with the range to cover players like Travis Kelce in 2019.


They could draft an inside linebacker early in April. They also might pursue an option in free agency. The idea of Pittsburgh stealing away C.J. Mosley from the Ravens in free agency is tantalizing, although it's more likely the Steelers would target someone like Sean Lee, who is likely to be released by the Cowboys. Since Lee would become available after being cut by his team, the two-time Pro Bowler wouldn't impact the compensatory pick formula.
The AFC South sent two teams to the playoffs in 2018, but unless you were particularly fond of underlying metrics, you might have been surprised to see that the Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts were those teams.
Of course, the Jacksonville Jaguars also were an advanced numbers darling before last season, and they collapsed, so can the Jags rise atop the AFC South again? Let's run through the moves each of these four teams might make in a suddenly competitive division.
1. Franchise Jadeveon Clowney. The Texans don't want to lose Clowney, nor should they. The 2014 No. 1 overall pick has made it to three consecutive Pro Bowls and just turned 26. He has completed only one full 16-game season as a pro, but the microfracture surgery on his right knee that cost the South Carolina product most of his rookie season hasn't been a problem since. Clowney has missed six games over the past four seasons, undergoing two subsequent arthroscopic surgeries on his other knee.
At the same time, the 6-foot-5, 255-pound Clowney hasn't yet put together the sort of massive season that seems natural for a defender who looks as dominant on the football field as he is. Fifty different defenders have racked up at least one double-digit sack campaign since the beginning of the 2014 season, but Clowney isn't one of them.
He has come close in each of the past two seasons, hitting 9.5 sacks in 2017 and getting to nine last season. But on his game, he looks like the sort of defender who should be annually flirting with Defensive Player of the Year honors. His knockdown totals don't suggest a player who has been trading in bad luck, either. Using the 45 percent rule, Clowney's 67 knockdowns over the past four seasons imply he should have racked up about 30 sacks over that time frame. He has recorded 29.
I'm not saying this to disparage Clowney. I would hardly be surprised if he put together a 15-sack season in 2019. Nobody would be. I bring this up to illustrate how difficult his contract negotiations might be. Edge rushers are paid to rack up sacks, and Clowney's 29 sacks rank 27th over the past four seasons. The Texans might very well point to his production as closer to good than great and suggest he's worth something below the five-year, $72 million extension that Danielle Hunter signed last year. (Hunter, for what it's worth, has 40 sacks over those four years.)
On the open market, though, Clowney would get to negotiate with 31 teams. At least one of those teams would be willing to take the plunge and pay him on his potential, expecting him to put up those 15-sack seasons his tape hints toward. On the open market, Clowney might get something closer to a five-year, $100 million deal with $60 million in guarantees, which would top every other edge rusher contract in the NFL short of Khalil Mack. You can bet Clowney's representation knows this. The Texans have to negotiate against that possibility. Going year to year with Clowney with franchise tags would cost the Texans around $68 million over the next three years, so there's no savings there, either.
The Texans will start with a franchise tag north of $17 million in 2019 and go from there. I think they'll eventually come to terms on an extension, if only because a long-term deal makes sense for both sides. This is going to be a more difficult negotiation than most other franchise tag extensions.
2. Re-sign Tyrann Mathieu. Mathieu's one-year, $7 million deal was a victory for both sides, as Mathieu stayed healthy and produced his best season since his All-Pro campaign in 2015. He was a consistent producer in a Texans secondary that struggled for steady play at cornerback last season, and while his 2015 performance might loom as an outlier, Mathieu's range and instincts make him a valuable free safety.
The 26-year-old Mathieu has suggested he wants to return to the Texans, and a new deal makes sense for both sides. In a market full of free safety options after a season when the league seemed to punt on the position, Mathieu might understandably prefer to lock up long-term stability in Houston. A three-year, $30 million deal could make sense for both parties.

So long, 2018 season. It's never too early to look ahead to 2019. Our crew of insiders weighs in on the biggest topics of the offseason.
3. Clean up the cornerback position. The Texans have thrown plenty of assets at corners, but things haven't quite worked out the way they planned. Kareem Jackson, a first-round pick in 2010 who spent eight years at cornerback, moved to safety last season to replace Andre Hal, who was battling leukemia. Jackson is a free agent. Kevin Johnson, a 2015 first-rounder, hasn't been able to stay healthy, and he missed 15 games in 2018 while dealing with the aftereffects of a pair of concussions. The Texans have a $9.1 million fifth-year option for him in 2019 that is guaranteed for injury, and it's unclear whether the Wake Forest product will be able to pass a physical. A failed physical would trigger that guarantee.
The Texans drafted Johnson with the hopes that he would eventually take over for Johnathan Joseph, who started 14 games at age 34 and is under contract for $4.8 million in 2019. When Johnson got hurt in 2016, the Texans promoted A.J. Bouye, who excelled in a starting role. The Jaguars signed Bouye to a five-year, $67.5 million deal in free agency in 2017, and the Texans responded by signing Jags slot corner Aaron Colvin to a four-year, $34 million contract last year.
After one year, it's hard to think of many significant free-agent deals that look worse than Colvin's. He missed six weeks with an ankle injury, but even after returning to health, the Texans seemed to sour on their new acquisition. Colvin played just 112 defensive snaps over the final six weeks of the season, 60 of which came in one game, when the Texans benched midseason addition Shareece Wright. Houston restored Wright to the lineup the following week in favor of Colvin, who was a healthy scratch in the wild-card loss to the Colts. Indy subsequently picked on Wright during the game, with Dontrelle Inman beating him for a 21-yard touchdown.
The Texans are probably locked into bringing back Colvin. The 27-year-old has a $8.6 million cap hit in 2019, and Houston would owe $10.5 million in dead money if it cuts him. Even if the Texans designated Colvin as a post-June 1 release, they would owe $8.5 million in dead money on their cap in 2019 and $2 million next year. Given their cornerback depth chart is Joseph and a series of question marks, the Texans likely will hope they can recoup something out of their investment in 2019. They'll also need to address the position in free agency or the draft.
4. Add a receiver, not Le'Veon Bell. The Texans have been popularly linked to Bell, given that Lamar Miller is entering the final year of his deal and 2017 third-rounder D'Onta Foreman missed virtually all of the 2018 season while recovering from a torn Achilles tendon. With Deshaun Watson making slightly more than $4 million over the next two seasons, the Texans have the cap space to go after a star running back like Bell.
I'm not sure it's the right move for the Texans. In a vacuum, Bell won't be a great deal for any team at the $15 million annual average salary he'll attract in free agency. The Steelers did just fine with James Conner and Jaylen Samuels as their primary backs last season. Bell's track record with injuries and suspensions suggest he's not likely to stay on the field for 16 games per season on a regular basis, either.
I also don't think the fit with the Texans is perfect. Houston mostly operates out of the pistol and shotgun, owing to Watson's comfort there going back to his time at Clemson. Watson took 85.1 percent of his pass dropbacks out of the pistol or in shotgun last season. Bell is certainly comfortable out of the shotgun -- he shows no significant split in performance regardless of where the quarterback begins on his rushing plays -- but nearly 62 percent of his runs over the past four years began with Ben Roethlisberger under center.
The Texans might want to add a back, but they're probably better off drafting a runner to compete with Foreman for carries after Miller leaves town. They have an extra second-rounder from the Duane Brown trade with the Seahawks, too.
Where Houston might instead want to make an addition is at receiver, where they've failed to surround DeAndre Hopkins with steady help. Will Fuller, a 2016 first-rounder, seems to have a telepathic connection with Watson but can't stay healthy. Fuller has 45 receptions for 782 yards and 11 touchdowns in 11 games with Watson, but the Notre Dame product also has missed time with a broken collarbone, cracked ribs, hamstring injuries and a torn ACL. Rookie fourth-rounder Keke Coutee battled a hamstring ailment throughout 2018, and Demaryius Thomas lasted seven games before tearing his Achilles.
The Texans have cycled through all kinds of tight end options over the past few seasons, and given the depth of that position in this year's draft, it's the most logical place they can upgrade on the likes of Ryan Griffin and Jordan Thomas. Jordan Akins, a third-round pick last year, will figure in the offense this season, but the former minor league baseball player will turn 27 in April and doesn't have much time to waste. If the Texans see a franchise tight end in this draft, they should do what they can to nab him.

5. Add help at offensive tackle. You thought I forgot? The Texans should use their first-round pick on a tackle. They should sign a free-agent tackle. They should hold an open tryout exclusively for tackles. They should ask J.J. Watt whether he has any brothers who forgot to try out for the football team and give them a shot at tackle.
1. Bring back Pierre Desir and Clayton Geathers. Desir was the standout corner for a surprising Colts defense last season. After losing his job with the Browns amid one of their many regime changes and bouncing around practice squads, he has found a home in Indy over the past two seasons. The Colts let starting corner Rashaan Melvin leave for the Raiders after the 2017 campaign, but I don't think they'll be as comfortable moving on from the 6-foot-1 Desir, whose size will interest teams like the Falcons in free agency. Kyle Fuller picked up a four-year, $56 million offer as a restricted free agent in 2018 after one good season as a corner, and Desir might angle for a similar sort of deal.
Indy will hope to get Desir signed for less than that, and bringing back Geathers would allow the Colts to keep their starting secondary intact. Geathers is a highlight-reel hitter, but the concern is health; the 2015 fourth-rounder has missed 22 games over the past three seasons, mostly with a neck injury. The Colts shouldn't be treating their 2018 team as a precious, irreplaceable group of players, but Geathers is a useful box safety and could even be a hybrid linebacker in nickel packages. If the team does re-sign Geathers, it will likely want to try to build his deal around per-game roster bonuses and prepare for the possibility that Geathers gets hurt during his deal.
General manager Chris Ballard also will have the ability to sort through some of the bargain-bin finds he has made over the past couple of seasons. He already has re-signed Mark Glowinski, but the Colts will have to decide whether they want to bring back veterans such as Margus Hunt, Najee Goode and Dontrelle Inman for 2019 or try to upgrade.
2. Add a difference-maker along the defensive line. The Colts have a lot to be excited about up front. Jabaal Sheard is one of the most underrated two-way ends in the game. Denico Autry broke out in a dramatic three-game stretch during December, racking up six sacks in three games. The Colts bring back a pair of 2018 second-rounders in Tyquan Lewis and Kemoko Turay, with Turay's 13 quarterback knockdowns ranking fourth among rookies.
The Colts ranked 29th in adjusted sack rate last season, though, and if they want to stay committed to defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus' Tampa 2 shell, they need to get consistent pressure with their front four. With three top-60 picks in a draft full of defensive linemen, it wouldn't be a shock if one of those picks went toward a pass-rusher.
I'd also think the Colts will head out to the free-agent market to try to find a veteran. Most of the big names such as DeMarcus Lawrence and Dee Ford are likely going to be kept off the market with franchise tags, but there also will be some big-name players hitting as salary-cap casualties.
Autry found success as a pass-rusher as Indianapolis moved him inside to rush against guards more frequently, but could the team supplement Autry by making a run at an interior disruptor like Gerald McCoy if he is cut by the Buccaneers? Ballard came to Indy from the Chiefs, who are likely to sacrifice Justin Houston to franchise Ford. Houston would have to adjust to having his hand in the ground more frequently, but on pure pass-rushing ability, the Georgia product would be an upgrade and a key part of an edge-rushing rotation.
3. Add help at wide receiver. The Colts were one of the most pass-happy teams in football last season. When the score was within 14 points, Frank Reich's offense threw the ball 64.5 percent of the time, good for the third-highest rate in the league. Only the Steelers (68.4 percent) and Packers (67.0 percent) leaned more heavily toward the pass while games were competitive.
T.Y. Hilton and Eric Ebron got 230 of Indy's 644 pass attempts. Ebron put up a career season, while Hilton missed two games and battled through injuries to excel in December and January. The group of Inman, Ryan Grant, Zach Pascal and Chester Rogers were targeted 201 times, and while Andrew Luck completed more than 68 percent of those throws, he averaged just 6.7 yards per attempt on those targets. Luck averaged 8.8 yards per attempt on his throws to Hilton and Ebron.
There's an opportunity to add an impact wide receiver, given that the Colts have virtually unlimited cap space; they could bring back Inman after he impressed as a midseason pickup, but the Colts also might find an opportunity to upgrade too. The wideout free-agent class isn't very enticing yet, but imagine this offense with Hilton across from, say, Antonio Brown?
4. Continue to add offensive line depth. For the first time in years, the Colts have an above-average offensive line. Indy has three starters on rookie deals to go with left tackle Anthony Castonzo and right guard Glowinski, who signed a three-year, $16.2 million deal to stay with the Colts in January.
Glowinski took over after veteran Matt Slauson went down with a back injury, and Slauson subsequently decided to retire last month. Jack Mewhort, who had been expected to add depth, unexpectedly retired in August. Indy was able to get by with Joe Haeg, Le'Raven Clark and Evan Boehm as backup linemen, but it needs to keep adding depth to the line, especially at tackle.

5. Pick up Ryan Kelly's fifth-year option. Few Colts took a bigger leap forward in 2018 than Kelly, the final first-round pick under former GM Ryan Grigson's reign. The Alabama product was a difference-maker on the ground, as Indy averaged 4.5 yards per carry and first downs on 25.2 percent of its rush attempts with Kelly on the field, but just 3.6 yards per rush and a 19.8 percent first-down rate with Kelly sidelined.
The 25-year-old suddenly looks like a building block, with injuries as the only notable problem holding him back. He has now missed 13 games over the past two seasons, but the Colts need to pick up Kelly's fifth-year option, despite the injury risk.
1. Designate Blake Bortles as a post-June 1 release. After years of being flush with cap space, the Jaguars find themselves in an unfamiliar place. Tom Coughlin's team is currently at or narrowly over the cap before signing any of its free agents, and it will need to create room to bring in its draft class and upgrade the roster.
To start, it's time for the organization to cut ties with Bortles, who teased Jaguars fans for years but never showed any sort of consistent play suggesting he was a franchise quarterback. The third overall pick in the 2014 draft, Bortles never pieced together six straight games with a QBR over 50 across his 75 games. Jacksonville floated the idea of benching him during the 2017 preseason, only to hand the UCF product a curious extension last offseason.
The most hard-core Jaguars supporters might note that Bortles' decline came after a sterling performance against the Patriots in Week 2, as both his offensive line and tight end room fell apart thanks to injuries, but the time for excuses is over. The past is a sunk cost. There's enough talent to win the division here with an upgrade at quarterback. Finding one won't be hard.
The Jags could have walked away from Bortles scot-free if they hadn't handed the 27-year-old an extension last winter, but they'll need to designate him as a post-June 1 release if they want to cut ties now. Jacksonville will eat a minimum of $10 million in dead money, with $5 million hitting its cap this year and $5 million in 2020.
The Jaguars are temporarily responsible for $6.5 million of Bortles' 2019 base salary, but they should be relieved of some of that burden in free agency by teams targeting Bortles as a backup. It wouldn't be a surprise to see Bortles attract a two-year, $10 million deal from a team such as the Bucs or Cardinals, which would get the Jags off the hook for some of the millions they owe.
Jacksonville should get something in the range of $15 million of salary-cap savings this year, depending on how much of Bortles' base salary is offset elsewhere. Doing that will get the Jags under the cap, but they'll still have more work to do.
2. Move on from Malik Jackson, Carlos Hyde and Austin Seferian-Jenkins. Jackson made his first Pro Bowl in 2017. Twelve months later, Jackson lost his starting job and was buried in the lineup behind 2018 first-rounder Taven Bryan. Jackson averaged 45.5 defensive snaps per game during the first half of the season, but by the final month of the campaign, the former Broncos standout was averaging exactly half that figure. The Jags can free up $11 million by moving on from him.
The trade for Hyde was an ill-fated attempt to find a veteran back to keep the Jags' offense going while Leonard Fournette and Corey Grant were injured. The Jaguars ended up trading a fifth-round pick for a player who carried the ball 58 times for 189 yards. Cutting Hyde generates $4.7 million more of cap space. Seferian-Jenkins got $4 million guaranteed as a free agent last year.
3. Don't do anything drastic at running back. During Dave Caldwell's run as Jags general manager, he has repeatedly attempted to solve his running back conundrum by throwing more and more resources at the position with no viable results. He started by signing Vikings backup Toby Gerhart to a three-year, $10.5 million deal. Gerhart lasted one year as a starter and was out of football by Year 3.
The Jags replaced Gerhart by using the 36th pick in the 2015 draft on T.J. Yeldon, who got one year as the primary starter. During the 2016 offseason, they gave Jets bruiser Chris Ivory a five-year, $32 million deal and had him split time with Yeldon. After Ivory missed five games and fumbled five times on 137 touches, they used the fourth overall pick in the 2017 draft on Fournette.
After two years, the Fournette move isn't looking great. The former LSU star has averaged 3.7 yards per carry and missed chunks of time in each of his first two seasons. The team is reportedly attempting to void the remaining $7.1 million in guaranteed salary on Fournette's deal after he was suspended for fighting Bills defensive end Shaq Lawson in the middle of a truly inconsequential game in November. Jacksonville presumably could cut Fournette and save that $7.1 million if Fournette's appeal does not succeed.
The Jags might be tempted to throw more money or high draft picks at running back to try to find a solution. They need to stop. They are better off hitting 2019 with Fournette and re-signing Grant, who was valuable both as a special-teamer and a receiving back when healthy. If the Jags want to use a midround pick on a back or sign a veteran for less than $2 million in free agency, that's fine. Devoting any serious resources to the position would invoke that famous cliché about the definition of insanity.
4. Sign Nick Foles or Tyrod Taylor. There aren't any foolproof options in this year's quarterback class, and that was before Joe Flacco was traded. Case Keenum was a Pro Bowler in 2017 and a backup-caliber passer otherwise. Foles is inconsistent, and he struggled mightily outside of the Andy Reid/Doug Pederson cocoon, although John DeFilippo, the Eagles' quarterbacks coach in 2017, is now the offensive coordinator in Jacksonville. Teddy Bridgewater has thrown 25 passes in three years since suffering a catastrophic knee injury. Ryan Tannehill has missed 24 games over the past three seasons. Taylor was a disaster in Cleveland last season.
The Jags could very well fall in love with someone like Ohio State's Dwayne Haskins, but they're in a difficult spot with the No. 7 overall pick. They can't afford to wait things out and trust that the Giants won't take Haskins at No. 6, and if they trade up anywhere short of the first overall pick, the Giants or Raiders might very well beat them to the punch. Moving up from No. 7 to No. 1 would almost certainly cost Jacksonville its 2020 first-round pick, and as its roster gets more expensive, it needs to replenish with cost-controlled talent.
If the Jaguars don't think Haskins is a lock to become a franchise quarterback, they're better off going for one of the two top veterans on the market. Foles has struggled to stay healthy for long stretches of time, but when you include his postseason heroics, he has posted a 64.4 Total QBR across 491 dropbacks since joining the Eagles in 2017. He is pretty clearly the highest-upside option on the market, although his price tag also will be commensurate: It wouldn't be shocking if a Foles deal approached $25 million per season.
Coughlin simply might not be able to devote that much money to the quarterback position, given the rest of Jacksonville's roster. The cheaper option would be to go after Taylor, who fits what Coughlin wants out of his offense. The Jags' avowed game plan is to dominate on defense, run the football and avoid giveaways. Of the quarterbacks on the market, nobody protects the football like Taylor. His career interception rate is 1.5 percent, the second best in NFL history for passers with 1,000 attempts or more. Taylor also has run for 1,700 yards on 299 carries over the past four seasons, which would take some of the workload off whoever ends up as the primary Jags back in 2019. Taylor is not a plug-and-play solution, but he'll play to what Coughlin wants and allow the Jaguars to spend elsewhere.
5. Pick up Jalen Ramsey's option and sign Yannick Ngakoue. Jacksonville should keep around the two best draft picks of Caldwell's reign. The mercurial Ramsey battled through a knee injury during a frustrating 2018 campaign, but he remains one of the best cornerbacks in the league. The Jaguars can pick up his fifth-year option for 2020 and start thinking about an extension for him now.
NFL Nation reporters grade each eliminated team's 2018 regular season and look ahead to what's in store this offseason. Full coverage »
The only other cornerback to be drafted as a first-round pick under the new CBA and extended after three seasons is Patrick Peterson, and Ramsey is going to get a similar sort of deal. Peterson signed a five-year, $70.1 million extension in 2014, when the cap was at $133 million. Now, with the 2019 cap projected to come in at $190 million, a similarly sized five-year deal for Ramsey would be worth $100 million.
The Jags also will want to start working on an extension for Ngakoue, who has rounded into form as one of the league's best edge rushers. The Maryland product has racked up 29.5 sacks and 10 forced fumbles during his three seasons in the NFL, and while his sack total fell from 12 in 2017 to 9.5 last season, don't think he was slipping. He knocked down opposing quarterbacks 33 times, the third-highest total in the league. Using the 45 percent rule, Ngakoue's knockdown totals should have generated something closer to 15 sacks, suggesting the 23-year-old could take another leap forward in 2019.

The Jags will try to point to the five-year, $72 million deal Danielle Hunter signed with the Vikings last season as an appropriate baseline, given that Hunter was also 23 and had 25.5 sacks after three years in the league. It's not going to work, in part because the resounding sentiment around the NFL after the Hunter deal was that the Vikings had managed to extract a discount. Ngakoue is going to get something closer to five years and $90 million to stick around.
1. Cut Johnathan Cyprien. The Titans have gotten little out of Cyprien, who was inconsistent as a four-year starter in Jacksonville before missing 22 of his first 32 games in Tennessee. The team might prefer to bring back Kenny Vaccaro or address strong safety in the draft, but Tennessee can do better than paying Cyprien a $5.5 million base salary in 2019. Parting ways with the 2013 second-round pick would save $5.3 million.
2. Pick up Jack Conklin's fifth-year option. After tearing his ACL in January 2018 during Tennessee's playoff loss in New England, the right tackle had an uneven third season. The 2016 first-rounder missed the first three games of the season rehabbing the knee, went down for one game with a concussion and then sat out the final three contests of the season with knee issues.
It's natural to be concerned about Conklin's knee, but the Titans have to pick up his fifth-year option and hope the 24-year-old will look like his usual self in 2019, another year removed from the injury. Most offensive linemen are able to recover from ACL injuries without missing much, so unless there are complications we don't know about, the Titans should still consider Conklin to be an essential part of their future.
3. Add edge-rushing help. Both Derrick Morgan and Brian Orakpo are free agents, and while GM Jon Robinson knew this day was coming, the preparations haven't gone as planned. Kevin Dodd, a second-round pick in 2016, was cut after two anonymous seasons in Tennessee and is out of football. Meanwhile, 2018 second-rounder Harold Landry had 4.5 sacks in his rookie season. Landry showed promise, but relying on him to be the primary pass-rusher would be aggressive.
The natural thing would be to look at what's going on with the Patriots, but I wonder whether the 270-pound Trey Flowers might be too big to play as a 3-4 outside linebacker in Mike Vrabel's defense. In a draft full of front-seven help, the Titans seem likely to address the edge with the 19th pick. Rashaan Evans, a first-round pick last year, also will likely see some reps on the outside as well, although his best role is alongside Jayon Brown on the interior.
4. Be realistic about Marcus Mariota. We've seen Mariota play four seasons as a pro quarterback. What we know is ... well, not much. He is capable of great plays and has a knack for big conversions in the fourth quarter, but there also are games in which he looks out of sorts from the start. Mariota struggles with turnovers, as the Oregon product has a below-average interception rate and nine or more fumbles in three of his four seasons. He is on his fifth offensive coordinator in five seasons, after Matt LaFleur left for the Packers, and you might argue that none of those five coordinators has built an offense that actually plays to his strengths.
What you can say with the utmost confidence, though, is that it's difficult to count on Mariota to stay healthy for all 16 games. He has yet to do it as a pro, suffering a meaningful injury each year, though he has missed only eight games across four seasons. In 2015, it was MCL sprains on both of his knees. In 2016, he fractured his right fibula in Week 16. In 2017, he got by with a mere hamstring strain. But last season, the 2015 No. 2 overall pick struggled with neck, elbow and nerve injuries, with a stinger eventually keeping him out of Tennessee's must-win game vs. the Colts in Week 17.
At this point, expecting Mariota, who will be an unrestricted free agent in 2020, to suddenly play 16 games in a row for years at a time is naive. The Titans have to treat the backup quarterback spot less like a fallback plan and more like an inevitability. They need to pay a premium and go after someone they're more confident in for two or three starts per year than Matt Cassel or Blaine Gabbert, who is under contract with the Titans for 2019.
There are free agents who represent a match for Mariota's mobility in Tyrod Taylor and Robert Griffin III, but given that the Titans haven't really built their offense around that mobility, they don't necessarily need a quarterback who is comfortable running the read-option. I wonder whether there might be a fit with Ryan Fitzpatrick, who was Tennessee's starting quarterback in 2011 and would qualify as one of the better backups in football. If the game of musical chairs ends with Keenum out of a starting job, the Titans would do well to pay a premium to bring him to Nashville.


5. Extend Kevin Byard. While the free safety was never going to keep up his eight-interception pace from 2017, he had every bit as good of a season in 2018 as the one that got him an All-Pro nod two years ago. He didn't get the same recognition because he picked off ""only"" four passes, but that's the reality of how voters perceive interception totals as driven by defensive backs when the cause can more often be quarterbacks. The 2016 third-round pick chipped in with two sacks and also threw a 66-yard touchdown pass to Dane Cruikshank when the Texans forgot to cover the Titans' gunner in Week 2.
Byard is a free agent in 2020, and while the Titans could choose to go year to year and use the franchise tag on him, Robinson might understandably want to reward one of his best draft picks since joining the organization. The two sides should eventually come to terms on a deal with an average annual salary of about $10 million.
Let's begin this week with the AFC West, where the Broncos already kicked off the player-acquisition window by reportedly trading for their new starting quarterback ...
1. Cut Case Keenum and Emmanuel Sanders. Realistically, there isn't going to be a trade market for Denver's 2018 starting quarterback given his $18 million base salary, $7 million of which is already guaranteed. Likewise, there's no credible scenario in which the Broncos keep the 31-year-old Keenum with a $21 million cap hit behind Joe Flacco. Denver would eat a $10 million dead cap charge by releasing Keenum, but it would free up $11 million in badly needed cap space in the process.
Adam Schefter says the Broncos were not interested in building around a rookie QB and believe their defense puts them in a win-now position.
The Broncos can create more room by moving on from their veteran receiver. Sanders returned to form last season and was averaging 72.3 receiving yards per game, but after tearing an Achilles in December, he might not be ready to start the season on the active roster. The team can cut the soon-to-be 32-year-old and free up $10.3 million more in space. After declining linebacker Brandon Marshall's option, these two moves would get the Broncos to $44.5 million in cap space.
2. Bring back Matt Paradis. This offensive line has been a mess for years, but the one bright spot has been the development of Paradis, who redshirted after being drafted in the sixth round in 2014 before starting 57 consecutive games. He missed the final seven games of last season with a fractured fibula, and while he should be healthy to start 2019, the Broncos don't yet have their star center under contract.
The franchise tag might not apply here, thanks to a rule structure that hasn't caught up with how teams value players. The NFL makes only one offensive lineman tag value available, and despite the fact that left tackles get paid more than linemen elsewhere along the line, the tag value for guards and centers is based on top-tier blindside protectors.
CBS Sports' Joel Corry projects that the 2019 tag for offensive linemen will come in at $14.2 million, which is an exorbitant sum considering that the largest annual average salary for any center in the league is Tampa's Ryan Jensen at $10.5 million. Paradis is also hitting the market at age 29, making him older than most typical first-time free agents. You can understand why he might also want to avoid the franchise tag. This is his best -- and possibly only -- chance at making life-changing guaranteed money.
In a league desperate for competent line play, though, Paradis is going to have a serious market. Jensen was three years younger than Paradis when he entered free agency, but he got a four-year, $42 million deal after just one year as a starting center. Paradis is likely to get a similar deal; it wouldn't be a surprise if he picked up a four-year, $44 million pact.
3. Work on bringing back Bradley Roby. A rare hit for GM John Elway in the first round of the draft, Roby excelled as Denver's third cornerback behind Aqib Talib and Chris Harris Jr., only to struggle last season after Talib left for the Rams. Roby is an unrestricted free agent, but the Broncos don't really have anyone to take his place in the lineup; Tramaine Brock is also a free agent, and third-round pick Isaac Yiadom played like a rookie in limited time. If no team blows away Roby with an offer -- which is entirely plausible given what we saw last season -- the Broncos should trust their first four seasons with Roby over an uneven 2018.

4. Add a weapon at tight end. Jeff Heuerman is a free agent, and while the Broncos were hoping that Jake Butt would give them an athletic tight end, Butt tore an ACL for the third time in practice last September. Knee injuries have limited the former Michigan man to three NFL games in two seasons. Troy Fumagalli, a fifth-round draft pick last year, spent all of his rookie season on injured reserve.
With the Broncos trading Demaryius Thomas and likely moving on from Sanders, they need to get more out of their tight end group as receivers. In a draft rich with tight ends, they have to consider using their second- or third-round pick on a weapon for Flacco. They also could be in the discussion for possible cap casualties such as Kyle Rudolph and Cameron Brate.
5. Resist the urge to go after a quarterback and draft front-seven help. While there were reports that Elway was infatuated with 6-foot-4 Missouri quarterback Drew Lock before the Flacco trade, Lock is the exact sort of big-bodied, inaccurate passer Elway has failed with over the past few seasons. Flacco is not a long-term solution, but unless Dwayne Haskins or Kyler Murray slips to the Broncos at No. 10 overall, Denver won't be in position to take a franchise quarterback.

Instead, the Broncos should replenish a run defense that ranked 16th in defensive DVOA a year ago. (Denver was fourth, in comparison, against the pass.) The Broncos are set on the edge with Bradley Chubb and Von Miller, but backups Shaquil Barrett and Shane Ray are free agents, so using a midround pick on the edge might make sense. The more obvious concern would be at the nose, where Domata Peko is an unrestricted free agent and Shelby Harris is a restricted free agent. The Broncos also could stand to add depth behind Derek Wolfe, who just completed his first 16-game season since 2014.
1. Franchise Dee Ford. The Chiefs can't afford to lose their best pass-rusher. Ford has 25 sacks in 37 games since becoming a full-time starter in 2016, and while he won't force seven fumbles again in 2019, he's a building block for this defense. Kansas City might start with the franchise tag, but Ford and the Chiefs likely should come to terms on an extension in the five-year, $90 million range by the end of the offseason.
2. Release Justin Houston. Ford's franchise tag would cost about $17.9 million and bring the Chiefs below $8 million in cap space. That's not enough given the other moves the Chiefs have to make, and the most obvious candidate to hit the street is Kansas City's other edge rusher. Houston signed a six-year, $101 million extension after a 22-sack season in 2014, but injuries have limited the Georgia product to 30 sacks over the ensuing four seasons. The team would free up $14 million in cap space by moving on from the 30-year-old Houston. Kansas City might get lucky and convince Houston to restructure his deal, but there's no way he can return in 2019 on a cap hit north of $20 million.
3. Work on a new deal for Chris Jones. The Chiefs also need to find the cap room to work on an extension for Jones, who enters the final season of his rookie contract in 2019. He is set to make only a $1.2 million base salary as part of a cap hit under $2 million, but the team can't plan on having the franchise tag available for Jones in 2020 for reasons I'll get to in a minute.
Jones was inconsistent during his college career and disappointed during his second pro campaign before delivering a 15.5-sack campaign for the Chiefs last season. They have to be at least a little reticent about handing him an extension, but he is too good of a player when he's on for the team to let him leave. The timing of the extension depends on another member of Kansas City's 2016 draft class ...
4. Or work on an extension for Tyreek Hill. If Kansas City can lock up Ford and sign either Jones or Hill to an extension this offseason, it can hold the franchise tag in wait for the other player next offseason. If not, the Chiefs run the risk of letting either Jones or Hill leave in free agency next March.
On paper, the Chiefs probably would prefer to extend Jones and leave Hill's rookie deal in place for one more season for financial reasons; Hill's fifth-round rookie contract is far cheaper than Jones', and the star wideout is going to net a much larger extension when the two sides do come to terms. You might make the case that the Chiefs should lock up Hill instead because he has been the more consistent player; Jones might not attract quite as large of a deal if he takes a step backward in 2019.
In terms of his on-field performance, Hill compares favorably to the other star wideouts who have signed extensions over the past couple of seasons. His numbers over his second and third seasons are similar to those of the league's other top young receivers over their same seasons, but he needs fewer touches as a receiver to rack up yardage, as you can see from the yards-per-target category:
Those stats don't include Hill's work as a runner (210 yards and a touchdown the past two seasons) or what he has done as arguably the league's best return man, with five return touchdowns in his first three seasons. It wouldn't be a surprise if Hill's next deal tops the five-year, $90 million extension Odell Beckham Jr. signed in August.
5. Find a new center. Coach Andy Reid has generally let his interior linemen leave in free agency, trusting that offensive line coach Andy Heck can mold castoffs or late-round picks into useful starters. When Rodney Hudson hit free agency four years ago, the Chiefs let him leave for the division rival Raiders, drafted Missouri tackle Mitch Morse, and moved him inside to take over as their starting center.

After 49 starts, the cycle will begin anew. Morse likely will leave for a big deal in free agency, and the Chiefs will get creative. Kansas City could hand the job to Austin Reiter, who started when Morse missed five games with a concussion. They could move former Browns center Cameron Erving from guard back to the pivot, where the first-round pick played during his final season at Florida State. Most plausibly, the Chiefs will draft someone in the middle rounds and Heck will turn him into a viable starter.
1. Work on a deal with Denzel Perryman. Two oft-injured defensive stars hit free agency this offseason for the Chargers. It's probably time to move on from star-crossed corner Jason Verrett, who has played just five games over the past three seasons since making the Pro Bowl in 2015. Even if they do want to bring back Verrett, it's hard to imagine him getting much more than the veteran minimum.
Perryman makes for a more difficult case. The former Miami product hasn't had a Verrett-sized injury history, but the Chargers' inside linebacker has missed 22 games in his first four seasons, including 16 in the past two years with knee, hamstring and ankle injuries. In the past four years, the Chargers have allowed a 53 Total QBR and an 88.9 passer rating with Perryman sidelined, but a 41.6 Total QBR and an 80.6 rating with Perryman on the field. The effect is more pronounced on the ground, where the defense allowed 4.7 yards per carry with Perryman off the field and 4.0 yards per rush with their former second-round pick on it.
I don't know how Perryman is valued given the injury history, but he's a helpful player for this defense. The Chargers ended the year playing safeties at inside linebacker in the postseason after Perryman and Jatavis Brown went down, and they might prefer a fresh start at the position. Some team is going to take the plunge on Perryman, and if he can stay healthy -- a huge ""if"" -- it is going to have an excellent football player on its hands. A deal with significant per-game roster bonuses would make sense if Perryman wants to return to Los Angeles.
2. Pick up Joey Bosa's fifth-year option. This is an easy call, as the only thing that has managed to stop the 2016 third overall pick has been his own health. The pass-rusher missed the first four games of his rookie season with a hamstring injury, then sat out the first half of the 2018 season while recovering from a foot injury. Bosa otherwise has 28.5 sacks in 35 career games, roughly a 13-sack rate over a full 16-game season.
The Chargers could consider working on an extension with Bosa, given that they might be buying low after a half-season. The only other first-round edge rushers to get an extension after three years under the current CBA are J.J. Watt and Robert Quinn. Los Angeles could go year by year with him and get his next three seasons for something slightly south of $40 million, which is far below his market value over that time frame. It's more likely that the two sides will find mutual ground on an extension next offseason.
3. Extend Philip Rivers. The fiery 37-year-old Rivers has shown little sign of slowing down, as he posted a 105.5 passer rating in 2018, which is tied for the best single-season mark in his career. (He posted a 105.5 passer rating in 2008, 2013 and 2018, so get ready for a 42-year-old Rivers to run roughshod on the AFC West again in 2023.) Rivers has said that he has no desire to play into his mid-40s, but on a championship-caliber team, it seems fair to believe that he has a couple of more years left in that right arm.
With Rivers entering the final year of the four-year, $83.3 million extension he signed in August 2015, it makes sense for the Chargers to try to tack on a two-year extension to get him to his age-40 campaign. Drew Brees signed a two-year, $50 million extension before the final season of his deal with the Saints last March; given a likely rise in the cap, a two-year, $54 million pact would make sense.
4. Add defensive line help. The Chargers have a lot of work to do up front, as 34-year-old nose tackle Brandon Mebane is a free agent, while L.A. declined the option on Corey Liuget, who started the 2018 season suspended and ended it on injured reserve with a torn hamstring. Throw in Darius Philon and Damion Square, both of whom are free agents, and the Chargers have to find players to make up more than 1,700 missing defensive snaps in 2019.
The decision to decline Liuget's option freed up $9.5 million of cap space, and it wouldn't be a surprise if the Chargers used some of that money to re-sign Philon, who started 13 games and chipped in with four sacks and nine quarterback knockdowns a year ago. L.A. could certainly look toward a deep draft for defensive linemen, but it also wouldn't be surprising to see the team pursue veteran help. Defensive coordinator Gus Bradley could put a word in for Malik Jackson if his former charge in Jacksonville is a cap casualty.
5. Don't sign Melvin Gordon to an extension. The running back is entering the fifth-year option of his rookie deal at $5.6 million. Gordon has been an asset to fantasy teams, scoring 38 touchdowns over the past three seasons. After fumbling six times on 217 touches as a rookie, he has responded by fumbling just four times on 862 touches over the ensuing three campaigns. His ability with the football makes him a three-down back, and he had his best season as a runner in 2018.
All of those things are true, but the Chargers have to give serious thought to letting Gordon leave after the 2019 season. For one, there are concerns about paying any veteran running back significant money after his rookie deal. Gordon doesn't have as many carries as other backs after their first four seasons, but that's because he has already struggled to stay healthy; he has completed just one 16-game season and missed nine games in four campaigns. Gordon has suffered knee injuries in three different years in addition to a 2016 hip sprain and a 2018 hamstring issue.
His on-field play hasn't been quite as impressive as those fantasy totals, either. Gordon's 28 rushing touchdowns have been the product of sheer volume near the goal line. He has 39 carries inside the 5-yard line in the past three seasons. Backs score on 41.8 percent of those carries, which would suggest Gordon should have scored 16.3 touchdowns on those rushes. He actually scored 18, which amounts to about one extra touchdown every two seasons, and that's without including his zero-touchdown season in 2015.
The former Wisconsin star doesn't have the cumulative numbers we would expect from a star back because of the injuries. He also hasn't been all that efficient on a per-carry basis. Here's Gordon's rank in yards per carry and expected point success rate (EPA+%), which measures how frequently a back's carries increase his team's chances of scoring, among backs with 150 carries or more in each of his four seasons:

In Gordon's four pro seasons, 19 backs have racked up 600 carries or more. Gordon ranks 11th in yards per attempt (4.0) and eighth in success rate (38.5 percent). He has been about a league-average back when healthy, and he hasn't been healthy for extended stretches of time. Gordon is unquestionably talented, but if he's looking for a Devonta Freeman-sized deal -- let alone something in the Le'Veon Bell or Todd Gurley ballpark -- the Chargers are probably better off drafting his replacement and letting him leave.
1. Trade Jordy Nelson. The experiment to bring in the 33-year-old Nelson didn't really take, as the longtime Packers standout caught 63 passes for 739 yards and three scores in a relatively anonymous 2018 campaign. Nelson still has something to offer, but he's of little use to a rebuilding Raiders team, something Jon Gruden should have realized before signing Nelson last offseason.
Nelson has only $3.6 million remaining on his deal for 2019, making him a modestly valuable asset as a WR2/WR3 in a market with little in the way of wide receiver help available. The Kansas State product might appeal to teams that strike out in free agency and don't love this year's draft class. Teams such as the Colts, Patriots and Cowboys could justify trading a fifth- or sixth-round pick for one year from Nelson. A Packers reunion might also make sense for both sides.
2. Don't sell off the offensive line. After trading away Khalil Mack and Amari Cooper last offseason, it might be tempting to continue the fire sale and trade away whatever isn't nailed down. If the Raiders had many veterans of interest beyond Nelson, it might make sense to put them on the market.
The one group I would hold onto in a rebuild, though, is Oakland's expensively assembled offensive line. The Raiders likely will move on from 35-year-old tackle Donald Penn, but their interior three of Kelechi Osemele, Rodney Hudson and Gabe Jackson shouldn't hit the market. Having a sound offensive line allows Gruden the best opportunity with which to evaluate Derek Carr and will make life easier for Oakland's next quarterback if Gruden decides to replace his 27-year-old starter. The Browns let Mitchell Schwartz leave in free agency and lost Alex Mack to the Falcons during their tanking phase, and they ended up paying for lesser veterans to replace their two future All-Pro linemen. The Raiders shouldn't make the same mistake.
3. Sit out unrestricted free agency (mostly). One thing I would follow from the Browns, though, is to avoid wasting time signing midtier free agents while blowing compensatory picks in the process. The Raiders could get a high comp pick for free-agent tight end Jared Cook, who had an outlier season in terms of touches and production last season and isn't likely to get better after turning 32 in April. They shouldn't waste that pick just to sign a player who won't help their long-term outlook.

4. Open for business if you don't like a quarterback with the No. 4 overall pick. The Raiders are in a bind. Oakland is the first team in this draft that is giving serious consideration to using its first-round pick on a quarterback. The Raiders also pick fourth behind the Cardinals, 49ers and Jets, each of whom could theoretically trade down with a team trying to move up and grab Dwayne Haskins or Kyler Murray. If a team loves one of those passers, it knows it will have to get ahead of Oakland.
If Oakland doesn't love these quarterbacks and wants to go another 16 games with Carr, it should turn the fourth pick into a trade asset. This roster is too thin to turn down any meaningful trade-down opportunities, and if a team like the Dolphins (No. 13) or the Redskins (No. 15) wants to get ahead of the Giants at No. 6, the Raiders should be able to pick up an extra first-round pick in the process. It means they will miss out on their best chance of adding elite talent with the fourth pick, but this team needs good young players at just about every single position.
5. Draft the best available player. Over and over again. Gruden's rebuild has left the Raiders with a promising offensive line, some players to hope upon in the secondary, and useful depth at defensive tackle, plus whatever you might think about Carr. The Raiders are in no position to be turning down talent at any position. In a draft full of front-seven pieces, offensive linemen and tight ends, Oakland should simply be trading down or picking the best players on its board.

26136728,"The Chiefs placed the franchise tag on Ford on Monday but are listening to trade offers for the outside linebacker and have received interest from multiple teams, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Kansas City is open to bringing Ford back, though, in the event that it does not find a suitable trade partner.
Justin Houston was never going to live up to the then-record contract he signed four years ago with the Chiefs.
Tuesday is the deadline for NFL teams to franchise players, and six teams already have locked down their stars.
So long, 2018 season. It's never too early to look ahead to 2019. Our crew of insiders weighs in on the biggest topics of the offseason.
Houston also has been informed that the Chiefs will try to trade him, a source told ESPN, and if no deal is reached he will be released. Houston carries a salary-cap number of $21.1 million for next season; trading or releasing him would save the Chiefs $14 million against the salary cap.
The Chiefs intend to switch their base defensive scheme from a 3-4 to a 4-3 under new coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, necessitating a position change for both players. They would be defensive ends in the new system after playing outside linebacker in the 3-4.
Ford, who will turn 28 on March 19, finally became the player the Chiefs envisioned when they drafted him from Auburn in the first round in 2014. Ford started all 16 games for the first time in his career and had a career high of 13 sacks. He also was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the first time.
The wait for Ford to become a consistently productive player was a long one. He had a total of 17.5 sacks in his first four seasons. Ten of those sacks came in a nine-game stretch in 2016. Otherwise, until 2018, Ford had 7.5 sacks to show for his other 42 games.
Ford ended his best season with his least productive game. He had no sacks or tackles in the Chiefs' AFC Championship Game loss to the New England Patriots. Ford also was penalized for lining up offside on a play that resulted in an interception in the final minute of the fourth quarter.
The interception could have allowed the Chiefs, who had a four-point lead at the time, to run out the clock. Instead, the Patriots continued their drive to a go-ahead touchdown and eventually won in overtime.
Houston, who turned 30 in January, joined the Chiefs as a third-round draft pick (70th overall) from Georgia in 2011. He showed his immense pass-rush ability by getting three sacks in a game against the Bears as a rookie. He had 22 sacks in 2014, missing the NFL record by a half-sack.
Houston hasn't come close to that standard since. His best sack total the past four seasons was 9.5 in 2017. He has 78.5 career sacks, putting him fourth on the Chiefs' all-time list.
Houston in 2015 signed a six-year contract worth $101 million, making him at the time the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history.
He was more than just a pass-rusher for the Chiefs. He was an excellent all-around player who defended the run well. He was chosen to play in the Pro Bowl three times and was a first-team All-Pro selection in 2014.

26104542,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Jason Witten is returning to the Dallas Cowboys, the team announced Thursday.
Witten is leaving ESPN's Monday Night Football and returning to the playing field less than a year after announcing his retirement. Sources told ESPN that the tight end is getting a one-year deal worth $3.5 million that can max out at $5 million, including roster bonuses and incentives.
Witten has played in 11 Pro Bowls during his 15 years with the Cowboys, becoming the franchise leader with 1,152 receptions, which ranks fourth in NFL history, and 12,448 receiving yards. He also holds franchise records for games played (239), consecutive games (236), starts (229) and consecutive starts (179).
Randall Cunningham and Deion Sanders lead a list of players who came out of retirement. Can Witten emulate their success?
The Cowboys head coach says ""backs-to-the-wall mentality has served us well through the years.""
Shaping the future of the franchise includes a busy schedule for Stephen Jones & Co. as they multitask on contracts and draft prospects at the combine.
In returning, he also will have the longest service time with the organization at 16 years.
""The fire inside of me to compete and play this game is just burning too strong,"" Witten, who will turn 37 in May, said in a statement. ""This team has a great group of rising young stars, and I want to help them make a run at a championship. This was completely my decision, and I am very comfortable with it. I'm looking forward to getting back in the dirt.""
According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, there are some in the Cowboys' organization who have long considered Witten as an NFL head-coaching candidate -- and this move could help serve as the bridge to his coaching career.
Before joining ESPN in May, Witten went back and forth on a decision to leave the game until ultimately signing a four-year deal with the network. There were some rough patches during his first year as an analyst, which he acknowledged, but he felt there was growth as well.
""I've known for about 10 to 14 days that he was seriously deliberating this,"" Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones told ESPN's Chris Mortensen on Thursday. ""As you know, when Jason retired last year, he had a real difficult decision. He obviously missed it. I've never seen anybody really embrace the physical part of football like Jason. He missed that. The rougher it is, the better.
""We're happy to have him. We think he can still play, and he thinks he can still play.""
Jones said he expects Witten to be more than a ""situational player"" for the Cowboys in 2019.
""I think he'll play more than that,"" Jones said. ""This is a big thing to him. He wants to be out there, and he will be out there this year.""
There were discussions about Witten's potential return to the playing field during last season, but he remained in the booth.
""We thank Jason for his many contributions to Monday Night Football and to ESPN over the past year and wish him continued success,"" ESPN said in a statement. ""We have seen many former coaches and players go into broadcasting before eventually returning to the game they love, so we understand Jason's desire to return to the Dallas Cowboys.""
In the statement, ESPN said it would determine next season's plans for Monday Night Football in the coming weeks.
Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki, another longtime Dallas athlete, was among those welcoming Witten back on social media.
Welcome baaaaack @JasonWitten
So this is what we're doing now @JasonWitten ?? Word??? 💭#CowboysNation #DallasCowboys #Cowboys #JasonWitten #Comeback pic.twitter.com/JOXFCxdpRj
Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said he was excited about Witten's return.
""I know he thought about the decision to go do Monday Night Football. He thought about it long and hard. It was a very heart-felt decision,"" Garrett told reporters Thursday. ""I don't think it was an easy decision for him. It was such a great opportunity. ... But in the long conversations we had before he made that decision, I knew he still loved to play football. There is no question in my mind he can still play at a high level.
""When he was away from it, he continued to realize that and understand that. He just decided to make this decision because he still loves the game and wanted to be a part of it.""
When he presented the Jason Witten Collegiate Man of the Year Award to Wisconsin's D'Cota Dixon on Feb. 12, Witten was asked if he would return to the field and said, ""I don't think we're going to. ... I don't know where that is.""
But he acknowledged he ""missed the heck out of playing.""
""Look, every day I was a part of the Cowboys, and even before that, I loved the game of football. I loved the process of it,"" Witten said. ""I loved March. I loved training camp. I loved getting better and adversity and going through it with [the] guys, that shared commitment part of it. Nothing can replace that feeling, and I knew that.""
His decision to return, according to sources, stemmed from his feeling that he had more to give as a player rather than any unhappiness with television. It also resets the clock for a possible selection to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
In 2017, Witten caught 63 passes for 560 yards and five touchdowns and was added to the Pro Bowl as a first alternate.
Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten ranks fifth in receiving yards -- and first among tight ends -- for a player who spent his entire career with one team.
Witten played almost every snap for most of his career, but he returns knowing he will be in a different role in 2019, serving as a mentor.
Without Witten, Cowboys tight ends ranked 20th in the NFL last season for receiving yards (710) and touchdowns (4).
The Cowboys drafted Dalton Schultz in the fourth round last year and saw him start seven games after Geoff Swaim went down with a broken wrist. Blake Jarwin led the Cowboys' tight ends with 27 catches in 2018 for 307 yards and three touchdowns. While Swaim is set to be an unrestricted free agent, the Cowboys also have Rico Gathers under contract and could look to the draft for a long-term answer at the position.
Witten's return also provides a security blanket for Dak Prescott, who ranks third among NFL quarterbacks with a 73.7 completion percentage to tight ends over the past three seasons. Prescott also was sacked 56 times last season, the second most in the league.
""Wow, that is surprising, but 'Wit' is a good leader,"" defensive end Taco Charlton told ESPN's Josina Anderson when notified of Witten's return. ""I enjoyed being around him. He is dependable ... and I know our team will be happy to have him back.""
Witten has remained in decent shape, if not football shape. He regularly was named one of the team's top performers in the offseason program, and those around Witten believe he can regain his strength rather quickly.
""I just think he's a football player,"" Pro Bowl guard Zack Martin said. ""I can't speak for him, but when you're still around football and not playing, I'm sure he wondered about [playing]. He's the ultimate competitor. If he felt he had something left in him to play, he was going to do everything he could to get the most out of it.""

26225460,"On the eve of the NFL's legal tampering period, sources told ESPN that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been actively shopping wide receiver DeSean Jackson for a potential trade and that the Philadelphia Eagles would be a preferred destination for Jackson.
A trade would be preferred for the Bucs, but some teams ESPN has spoken to believe Jackson will be released rather than traded. Jackson is still under contract, and the Bucs have the option of holding on to him for 2019.
The Eagles are expected to have mutual interest in Jackson, who would provide the deep threat they sorely lacked in 2018 after Mike Wallace broke his leg in Week 2, against Tampa Bay. However, it's to be determined whether they would be willing to trade for him or would be interested only if he is released.
No move has been made, but Jackson said his farewell to the Buccaneers in an Instagram post Monday, saying ""things didn't work out"" and that he is looking forward to his next destination.
 Tampa it was a great experience, but things didn't work out !! Looking forward to my next destination .. 👀 👀 Stay Tuned #0ne0fone
A post shared by  Desean Jackson (@0ne0fone) on Mar 11, 2019 at 9:53am PDT
Jackson, who sold his home in Tampa before the end of last season, has one year left on his three-year, $33.5 million contract with the Bucs. He is set to earn $10 million in 2019, with no guaranteed money remaining.
Trading or cutting Jackson would free up $10 million in salary-cap space for the Bucs, who currently have less than $3.5 million in cap room.
Jackson, 32, was a second-round draft choice of the Eagles in 2008 and spent his first six seasons in Philly, where he averaged 59 catches, more than 1,000 yards and five touchdowns per year. He was unceremoniously cut by coach Chip Kelly in March 2014, following a career year in which Jackson posted 1,332 receiving yards and nine touchdowns.
Nevertheless, he has told people close to him that he has interest in returning to Philadelphia.
Last month, new Bucs coach Bruce Arians had a long sit-down with Jackson, a conversation Arians said at the NFL scouting combine ""couldn't have gone better."" But general manager Jason Licht said, ""I'd say all options are on the table,"" when asked about Jackson, while also praising his speed.
Jackson had a direct conversation with the Buccaneers' front office over the weekend about his status and trade considerations, a source told ESPN's Josina Anderson.

Jackson's desire has been to play for a contender. He wants to play for a coach and with a quarterback who understand the unique needs of a veteran wide receiver in the twilight of his career. Jackson also said during Super Bowl week in January that he would like to eventually end up with Los Angeles Rams because of a prior relationship with their head coach, Sean McVay.
Signed as a free agent in 2017, Jackson was brought in to give the Bucs a true vertical speed threat they had been lacking on offense. But Jackson and quarterback Jameis Winston struggled to develop chemistry on the field, and Jackson grew increasingly frustrated by it. It was only magnified when Ryan Fitzpatrick stepped in as starter.
In two seasons with the Bucs, Winston posted a 48.9 completion percentage targeting Jackson, while Fitzpatrick posted a 67.2 completion percentage when targeting Jackson. This, and Fitzpatrick's 1,230-yard passing performance in the first three games of 2018, led Jackson to publicly campaign for Fitzpatrick to remain the starter when Winston returned from suspension.
Jackson became frustrated when Winston continued to start, leading Jackson to request a trade prior to the October 2018 trade deadline. Winston was benched midway through Tampa Bay's Week 8 game against the Cincinnati Bengals before regaining his starting job midway through the Week 11 loss to the New York Giants.
Even with his struggles with Winston, Jackson averaged 15.85 yards per reception with the Bucs in 2017 and 2018. His career 17.42 yards-per-catch average is second-most in the NFL since 2008. Jackson's 34 career receiving touchdowns on plays of 20 or more air yards is also the most of any player in the league since 2008.
""He hasn't lost a step,"" Licht said at the combine.
In 2018, Jackson caught 41 passes for 774 yards and four touchdowns. He broke Jerry Rice's record for most touchdown catches of 60-plus yards. He also became the 47th player in NFL history to eclipse 10,000 receiving yards.

26274671,"The Miami Dolphins are trading longtime starting quarterback Ryan Tannehill to the Tennessee Titans.
Miami will receive a 2020 fourth-round pick along with a 2019 seventh-round pick in exchange for Tannehill and a 2019 sixth-round pick.
Tannehill will become a well-accomplished backup for Marcus Mariota in Tennessee, replacing Blaine Gabbert. Titans general manager Jon Robinson said he informed the veteran QB that he will be released.
Miami has a huge quarterback void to fill and seems likely to look toward the draft to do so.
The Titans restructured Tannehill's contract into a deal that will pay him $7 million fully guaranteed with a chance to make up to $12 million in incentives for the 2019 season, a source told ESPN. The deal was made easier for Tennessee since Miami will pay $5 million of the guaranteed money in the form of a signing bonus, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Miami's relationship with its 2012 first-round pick had run its course and it couldn't wait any longer for the QB to become something different.
Vontaze Burfict is headed to Oakland as a veteran stopgap. Did the Raiders actually improve? Bill Barnwell evaluates the biggest deals.
The Dolphins decided to move on from Tannehill earlier this offseason, and they've spent the past few weeks actively pursuing a trade.
Tannehill was originally due $18.7 million in salary in 2019 and was set to count as $26.6 million against their salary cap. Miami, in the midst of a rebuild, couldn't justify those huge numbers for a player who clearly wasn't part of their long-term future.
Tannehill will leave a $13.4 million dead cap hit on the Dolphins' salary cap in 2019 plus the effects of the $5 million signing bonus they paid to execute the trade. But they did get trade value out of a player they were set to release this offseason, and it will clear their salary cap even more for 2020 -- a big year for the Dolphins as they progress through their rebuild.
""We would like to thank Ryan for his commitment to the Miami Dolphins over the last seven seasons,"" Dolphins general manager Chris Grier said. ""Ryan is a tireless worker who always put the team first. We wish him the best with the next step of his career.""
Tannehill now reunites with veteran defensive end Cameron Wake, who signed a three-year, $23 million deal with the Titans earlier this week.
The 30-year-old Tannehill has been the Dolphins' starting QB since he was drafted with the eighth overall pick of the 2012 NFL draft out of Texas A&M.
He's 42-46 as a starter, with a 62.8 percent completion rate, 20,434 passing yards, 123 touchdowns and 75 interceptions. He completed 64.2 percent of his passes for 1,979 yards, 17 touchdowns and 9 interceptions in 2018.
Tannehill's time in Miami was marked by his lack of availability due to injury and inability to get the Dolphins over the playoff hump. Tannehill has missed 25 games over his past three seasons due to a variety of injuries, including a right shoulder capsule injury that cost him five games in 2018.
The injuries also sapped some of what made Tannehill an intriguing quarterback early in his career: athleticism, ability to make plays when they break down and a strong arm with precise accuracy.
For the Titans, they've been looking for multiple seasons to find a top-end backup as injury insurance for Mariota. Titans general manager Jon Robinson got creative in a trade to find the best option to fill the role.
Mariota, 25, hasn't played a full 16-game season in his career. He's also playing on a fifth-year option worth $20.9 million, and he's set to be a free agent after the season.
Tannehill's skill set should fit well behind Mariota as both players rely on accuracy and movement to succeed.
Gabbert had appeared in eight games, including three starts last season for Tennessee. He completed 60 percent of his passes for 626 yards with four touchdowns and four interceptions.
The Titans played the Dolphins in each of the last four seasons with Tannehill playing in three of those games, going 2-1 against Tennessee. Robinson likely got a good look then of what he's getting in Tannehill, who has proved to be at minimum one of the NFL's best 32 quarterbacks when healthy.
The Dolphins spent seven years trying to get a full evaluation of Tannehill, and ultimately they decided it would be a counterproductive same-old-Dolphins way of thinking to let him get another shot under a new staff. Brian Flores was hired to replace Adam Gase as head coach after the season ended.
The Dolphins now face a new era without a clear answer at quarterback. They have been actively examining quarterbacks in the 2019 NFL draft class, and they seem to be a strong candidate to select a prospect in the first round of this year's draft or the next one.
The Dolphins currently have just two quarterbacks on their roster: Jake Rudock and Luke Falk. Neither has started a game in the NFL, and they've combined for five career passing attempts.
Miami will be looking for a veteran quarterback in the coming weeks to add to the roster. Top available free agents include Colin Kaepernick, Blake Bortles, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Robert Griffin III, AJ McCarron and Mike Glennon.

26186487,"The Antonio Brown trade, at its core, is about money. It's about a lot of other things -- power, respect, aging and double standards all come to mind -- but at the end of the day, this is a trade about money, which is why I didn't think it was going to happen. I'm not sure there has been a swap like this in recent memory, in which a superstar player on a veteran deal was dealt away in the prime of his career without offering his team any sort of salary-cap savings.
In making this trade now, the Steelers are passing up the opportunity to keep one of the five best wideouts in football on their roster for $22.2 million of cap space for the opportunity to eat $21.1 million in dead money on their 2019 cap and let that guy play for somebody else. Organizations only eat that sort of dead money when they have a player commit some serious off-field indiscretion (Junior Galette, Ray Rice), or if they're rebuilding and dumping underwater contracts from the previous regime (Marcell Dareus), and that's usually over two seasons.

Raiders get: WR Antonio Brown
Steelers get: third-round pick (No. 66 overall) and fifth-round pick (No. 141)

As a 30-year-old receiver who led the league in touchdown catches last season, Brown is none of those things. For a team regularly in contention with an aging quarterback to willingly turn 11 percent of its salary cap into dead money requires a very specific, strange set of circumstances to go wrong. To make that decision and net a pair of midround picks is potentially unprecedented.
When it appeared the Steelers were only cranky about Brown, I assumed both sides would eventually work toward a resolution, mostly because it didn't make financial sense for the team to tie up its cap space to let Brown go somewhere else. The point where things shifted was when Brown went onto social media and indicated that he also wanted a change of scenery. It wasn't quite Terrell Owens doing sit-ups in his driveway, but Brown's decision to go onto Twitter and call out Ben Roethlisberger didn't do his situation any favors.
In the process of trying to push his way out of Pittsburgh, Brown eroded the organization's leverage. The Steelers spent the past two months publicly flailing, alternately leaking stories that suggested a trade hinged on getting a first-round pick, then suggesting it wouldn't. They set a final offer deadline for Friday and then let that deadline come and go. After news conferences and statements from various levels of the organization seemingly contradicting each other, they were forced to settle for third- and fifth-round picks from the only team that seemed seriously interested in bidding for Brown throughout the entire process.
Imagine going 12 months back in time to tell the biggest Steelers fan you know that Pittsburgh traded Brown for two midround draft picks. Heck, imagine going back six months ago and telling the biggest Steelers fan you know that they would get worked in a deal by the Raiders.
If you want to trace back to where everything went wrong in the relationship between the Steelers and Brown, it starts with one of the best contracts in modern league history. After Brown's second year in the league yielded an 1,108-yard season, the team gave the 2010 sixth-round pick a considerable raise by signing him to a five-year, $42 million extension with an $8.5 million signing bonus. The Steelers were only able to sign Brown after two seasons because he was drafted under the old CBA; had Brown been drafted after the 2010 season, the Steelers would have needed to wait for a third year before signing Brown to a deal.
In Year 4, Brown broke out as one of the top wideouts in the league with a 1,499-yard campaign. From 2013 to '16, Brown averaged -- averaged -- 120 catches, 1,578 yards and 11 touchdowns per season. Because he was under contract through the end of the 2017 season, though, the Steelers were able to pay Brown just $28.8 million over that four-year span, which is a little more than the annual average salary guys such as Robert Meachem and Laurent Robinson were getting in free agency. Former Steelers teammate Mike Wallace hit free agency and netted a five-year, $60 million deal with the Dolphins that paid him $36.9 million over three seasons before he was cut after 2015.
Antonio Brown will respect -- and has the respect of -- head coach Jon Gruden and should add just the right spice to the Raiders' mix.
Vontaze Burfict is headed to Oakland as a veteran stopgap. Did the Raiders actually improve? Bill Barnwell evaluates the biggest deals.
Antonio Brown heads to the Raiders for a few modest draft picks and leaves the Steelers with a lot of dead money.
Brown was making less than half of his true market value, and while most players deal with that during their rookie deals, he was struggling with it on his second contract. With the Steelers' cap tied up thanks to years of subpar financial decisions, they repeatedly restructured Brown's deal to create pockets of short-term cap room without giving him any notable raise. (For those unfamiliar with how the cap works, these restructures meant that Brown would receive most of his weekly base salary as an upfront bonus in March; he would take home the same amount of cash and get paid earlier, but the Steelers would be allowed to spread the cap hit for the restructured bonus over several years, creating temporary room.)
In part because of those cap concerns, Pittsburgh waited five years and for the final year of Brown's extension to give its star receiver an extension. Most teams will say that waiting until the final year of a deal to hand out a new contract is organizational policy, with Pittsburgh among them, but the Steelers gave Roethlisberger an extension with two years left to go on his rookie deal in 2008.
When they did give Brown his deal, they applied a cap structure that is generally unique to the Steelers. Most teams hand out extensions to star players by giving an upfront signing bonus and guaranteeing at least two years of base salaries, which makes it extremely likely a player will remain on the roster for those two seasons. For a star quarterback or a transcendent player like Brown, a team will either explicitly guarantee three seasons or structure the contract in a way that it would be virtually impossible to cut a player for cap reasons.
Instead, the Steelers have a policy of guaranteeing only the bonuses in the first year of their deals. Cameron Heyward's deal has $15 million guaranteed, with a $12 million signing bonus and a $3 million roster bonus paid in Year 1, but nothing else afterward. Elite guard David DeCastro has a $16 million guarantee, all of which is in his signing bonus. Even Roethlisberger's most recent extension consists of a $31 million signing bonus with no other guarantees, although the veteran quarterback did get partial guarantees for injury only in Years 2 and 3.
After waiting for years to get his contract, Brown got $19 million guaranteed when he signed his deal, all in the signing bonus. Throw in a $910,000 base salary and Brown took home $19.9 million in 2017 as part of a four-year, $68 million extension. That's good money, of course, but when DeAndre Hopkins signed his extension six months later, he took home $24 million in 2017 and still had a $12.5 million guaranteed base salary for the following season. Brandin Cooks' extension paid $11 million in Year 1, but the structure of the deal basically guarantees he'll take home $63.5 million over the next four seasons. Brown only gets to that ballpark if he continues to be great.
The reason a player would be comfortable taking a deal with that sort of structure is because the large signing bonus generally shields them from being cut, even without a guaranteed salary. Heading into last season, for example, the Steelers had to choose between keeping Brown on their roster with a cap hit of $16.8 million or either cutting or trading him, which would have incurred $15.2 million in dead money. In that scenario, they would choose to keep Brown 999 times out of 1,000, but you also can imagine how that one-in-a-thousand example might be enough to antagonize Brown, if only because it just happened.
Pittsburgh's last mistake -- and a clear sign that it was not expecting to move on from Brown anytime soon -- was when it restructured his deal last offseason. The Steelers owed him a $7.9 million base salary and a $6 million roster bonus, neither of which were guaranteed, but instead converted $7 million in salary and the $6 million roster bonus into a signing bonus. The move paid Brown that $13 million up front, with the remaining $915,000 coming during the season, and it cleared out $9.7 million in cap space in 2018. It's the sort of thing you do only if you're absolutely sure you're not going to need to part ways with that player the following season.
If the Steelers hadn't restructured Brown's deal, they could have traded him and owed $11.4 million in dead money. The deal would have represented a $7.5 million cap savings. Instead, because they used Brown's deal to create more short-term cap space, they will owe $21.1 million in dead money on their cap for Brown this year, which is believed to be the largest single-season dead money total for a player in league history.

Given what has happened over the past decade, you might understand why Brown would feel disrespected, even on a deal with an average annual salary in new money of $17 million per season. There was no chance that the Steelers, who exploited one of the best bargains in football for years, were going to uproot their contract structure by giving Brown a new extension or even guarantee a future season with three years left on his current deal. Instead, they preferred to let someone else pay Brown.
It's one of the same reasons why they weren't able to come to terms with Le'Veon Bell, who says the Steelers offered him only $17 million guaranteed as part of a five-year, $70 million deal. That contractual policy is going to cost the team both of its star weapons in the same offseason, and its cap philosophy is going to make it feel the pain of that decision in one of the final seasons of Roethlisberger's career.
Compare the Steelers to the team that has kept them from a return trip to the Super Bowl over the past eight seasons. The Patriots rarely restructure contracts, and when they do, it's not the sort of maxed-out move the Steelers pulled with Brown. The only player on the Pats' roster with a restructure cap hold of more than $1.3 million in 2018 or 2019 is Tom Brady. The Pats also had a bargain of a deal similar to Brown's initial extension with the six-year, $54 million extension they handed to Rob Gronkowski after his second season in the league, but unlike the Steelers, the Patriots have sweetened Gronkowski's deal by adding incentives to keep their star tight end happy.
Of course, it's tempting to lump the Amari Cooper trade in with this deal and point out that the Raiders essentially traded Cooper and two midround picks for Brown and a first-rounder. It turned out that way in the long run, of course, but it's the wrong way to think about things. The Raiders didn't make the Cooper trade knowing that Brown would come available for a pittance. Comparing the relative merits of Brown and Cooper is irrelevant because the Raiders never had a chance to choose between them.
Evaluating this trade in a vacuum, it's difficult to find an argument against the Raiders making the move. The draft pick compensation is a drop in the bucket for a team with three first-round picks, as new general manager Mike Mayock did well to resist Pittsburgh's attempts to negotiate for a first-round pick through the media. The 66th and 141st picks are equivalent to the 41st pick in a typical draft by the Chase Stuart draft chart, while the traditional Jimmy Johnson chart has them add up as something closer to the 61st selection. Either way, if you want to invoke a recent Raiders trade, this is the same organization that used third- and fifth-round picks to trade for Martavis Bryant and AJ McCarron under Jon Gruden's watch.
Financially, the Raiders entered the offseason with more than $60 million in cap room, so absorbing a new deal for Brown wasn't going to be an issue. AB's new contract is reportedly a three-year pact worth $54.1 million with $30 million guaranteed, which is a far cry from the zero dollars and zero cents that was remaining in guarantees on his Steelers deal.
In reality, it's not even as huge of a contract as it might seem. Brown wasn't going to take a pay cut, so any team trading for him was going to pay him a minimum of the $15.1 million he was due this season. We don't yet know how his deal is structured, but with that $30 million number, it seems likely that he got a second guaranteed year as part of this new deal, which isn't crazy by any means. You would figure that a team trading for Brown would expect to have him on its roster for at least two seasons.
The $54.1 million figure produces an annual average salary of $18,033,333, which also isn't an accident, given that the largest annual average salary for any wideout is Odell Beckham Jr.'s $18 million per year. Brown might have to hit incentives to get to that mark, but it appears that the Raiders added about $3.75 million per year to Brown's existing contract. In a league in which Sammy Watkins got three years and $48 million in free agency last year -- a mark that would translate to $51 million after a year of cap inflation -- is giving Brown $54 million over three years really unreasonable? I don't think so.
On the field, this move reminds me a lot of why the Cowboys traded for Cooper, actually. When I analyzed that deal, I wrote that the Cowboys were acquiring Cooper to help evaluate Dak Prescott in anticipation of a possible extension this offseason. Trading for Cooper also allowed the Cowboys to get ahead of a terrible wideout market, and while nobody could have anticipated that the Cowboys would go on a 7-2 run with Cooper in the lineup, there was logic to the move.
Here, Oakland has its own evaluation to conduct. Gruden spent a year with Derek Carr, and while the results were uneven at times, Carr didn't have a great receiving corps. He did get to throw 101 passes to Jared Cook, who had a career year, but Jordy Nelson looked well past his prime at age 33. Seth Roberts continued to lose the battle against drops. With Cook a free agent, Carr was staring down at a Week 1 receiving corps of Nelson, Marcell Ateman and Derek Carrier. I don't need to tell you how Brown makes that better.

If the Raiders do decide to draft a quarterback in the first round, getting to play with Brown makes it way easier for Kyler Murray or Dwayne Haskins to adjust to the pro game. Few receivers in the league remain as skilled at getting themselves open against just about any possible kind of coverage. With limited weapons elsewhere in the lineup and a mediocre roster in the middle of a rebuild, Brown is well-positioned to get all the targets he could desire. It would hardly be a surprise if he became the first player to rack up 200 targets in a season since Julio Jones did it in 2015.
There's also realistically a marketing element to this move. When I wrote about the Cooper trade, I mentioned that the closest billboard in Las Vegas to the Raiders' future stadium featured Gruden, and Gruden alone. After trading away Cooper and Khalil Mack in one season, it was a smart move to keep Gruden on the board, since he seemed to be the only one sure to make it to Las Vegas for 2020. Trading for Brown gives the Raiders a star to build around as they relocate to Sin City. People weren't going to line up to buy Carrier or Ateman jerseys. Brown is a bona fide superstar.
Is there a chance this all goes south? Of course, especially in Year 2. Remember that Gruden inherited Keyshawn Johnson when he took over the Bucs in 2002. The two won a Super Bowl together in Gruden's first season with Tampa. Halfway during the subsequent campaign, Gruden's relationship with Johnson became so toxic that the Bucs sent Johnson home and deactivated him for the final seven games of the year.
Even if that happens, though, the Raiders will be out some money and a pair of midround picks. There's nobody like Brown in this free-agent class, and there's nobody who will move the needle more for their fan base who also would have considered Oakland. There's risk involved here, but it's a risk the Raiders had to take.
One of the reasons the Steelers will be able to make this trade and sleep at night is the presence of JuJu Smith-Schuster, who doesn't turn 23 until November and looks to be one of the most promising young wideouts in recent memory. Since entering the starting lineup in Week 9 of his rookie season, Smith-Schuster has averaged 91.8 receiving yards per game, which ranks fourth in the NFL behind Hopkins, Jones and Brown.
Hopkins and Jones are clear No. 1 options in their own offenses, while Smith-Schuster has had to cede massive amounts of touches to Brown. Smith-Schuster has averaged 9.6 targets per game to Brown's 11.3, while Hopkins has averaged 10.9 and Jones 10.3. Give Smith-Schuster a larger role, hand over some targets to second-year wideout James Washington, and the Steelers should be fine. Right?
Adam Schefter details the process of how the Steelers and Raiders agreed on an Antonio Brown trade and what it means for both teams.
It's not quite that simple. For one, plugging Washington in as a guaranteed starting wide receiver is dangerous. The Steelers have hit in the recent past on wideouts like Brown, Smith-Schuster, Wallace and Emmanuel Sanders, but they've also used third-round picks on Dri Archer, Sammie Coates and Markus Wheaton, none of whom developed into regulars. Washington caught just 42.1 percent of the passes thrown to him as a rookie; it's still way too early to judge him, of course, but it's not as if the 60th overall pick has done something to make us think he's a plug-and-play starter.
Smith-Schuster and Brown aren't exactly the same sort of receiver, either. Yahoo's Matt Harmon tracked both of their seasons and found that Smith-Schuster lined up far more frequently in the slot, which resulted in way less press coverage. Brown was double-teamed more than 10 times as frequently as Smith-Schuster was. With Brown gone, the Steelers will likely continue to let Smith-Schuster take more than half of his snaps in the slot, but the wildly talented third-year wideout will undoubtedly see more attention. The Steelers also will need to find someone capable of winning against press coverage on the outside without Brown.

Pittsburgh probably has to find at least one veteran wide receiver to chip in, which is going to be a pain given the aforementioned dead cap hold on Brown. The team already has mooted the idea of restructuring Roethlisberger's contract to create cap room, but with one year left on the 37-year-old's deal, any change is going to be an extension to keep Roethlisberger around while creating short-term cap space. The Steelers eventually will pay for their accounting, as they are with Brown here, but they should be able to create $6-7 million or so in cap space with a Roethlisberger extension, which could go toward a new wideout.
They'll also probably run the ball more frequently in 2019 with Brown on the Raiders. They threw the ball on 67.4 percent of their offensive snaps last season, the second-highest rate in football behind the Packers. A more successful Steelers team will run the ball with a lead more frequently in the fourth quarter, but even after accounting for changes in game script, the Steelers should trust James Conner more than they did a year ago. Conner touched the ball 20.7 times per game last season, down from Bell's 27.1 in 2017.
I normally consider these grades from the team's perspective, in part because it's usually easier to understand how a team functions and thinks over the course of dozens of acquisitions and releases than it is to think about things from the perspective of a player who might sign only one or two deals over the course of his career. Every player in the NFL is vastly underpaid in a vacuum, but in the context of a league with a salary cap, the money matters.
From my perspective, it sure looks like Antonio Brown battled to get what he wanted and succeeded. He wanted to call out Roethlisberger for disrespect and did so publicly, sparking an embarrassing comment from general manager Kevin Colbert about the Steelers having 52 kids under Roethlisberger. Brown wanted guaranteed money and a raise from an organization that regarded that as anathema, and he played his cards right and ended up getting exactly that from another organization. He wanted to be respected and appreciated for his work.
No, his chances of winning a Super Bowl aren't as high as they were a month ago. After going underpaid for the better part of a decade, though, you can understand why Brown would want to take advantage of what will probably be his last chance to get top-wideout money. The Steelers will still be good on offense in 2019, but without their star receiver and with Bell following him out the door, they might have cost themselves one last chance to win a Super Bowl with Roethlisberger at the helm.

26266176,"To do that, though, he had to pay the Eagles $2 million to buy out the final year of his contract so he could become a free agent. That's a significant chunk of money to spend at once, even for a professional athlete, but Foles never hesitated.
""When you look at the monetary value, absolutely, yes, that is a lot of money, for my family and for the different things we can do in the community, but at the same time it was a no-brainer,"" Foles said. ""It was the best $2 million investment I could ever do.""
He got a pretty good return on his money. That $2 million turned into a guaranteed $50.125 million on Thursday when he signed a four-year contract worth $88 million to become the starting quarterback of the Jacksonville Jaguars. It's a job he's wanted since a disappointing 2015 season in St. Louis caused him to lose his zeal for the game.
""It was nothing against Philly. I love Philadelphia,"" Foles said. ""They know how much I love them and I always will love Philadelphia no matter what, just like I love the University of Arizona, just like I love Westlake High School [in Texas], but life changes, things move on, you go to a different part of your life. But to be a free agent, to have an opportunity to ultimately go into a locker room and help lead a team and help change the environment is what intrigued me.
""That's why it was paid back so quickly. It had nothing to do with, 'I want out of here.' It's just my time. I've ran my race in Philadelphia. I did everything I could and I'm proud of that. I've been around amazing people but I look forward to going somewhere else and helping another team and ultimately I hope it's my last.""
So do the Jaguars, who have been searching for a franchise quarterback since Mark Brunell led them to a pair of AFC Championship Game appearances in the team's first five years of existence. The Jaguars tried Byron Leftwich, David Garrard, Blaine Gabbert and, most recently, Blake Bortles, but none has been the answer, though Garrard and Bortles had some success in the playoffs.
Foles is here now because of what he did in the postseason, taking over for an injured Carson Wentz and leading the Eagles to a Super Bowl LII championship after the 2017 season. He out-dueled Tom Brady and was the game's MVP. Foles was forced into the same role again last season and nearly led the Eagles to a comeback victory over New Orleans in a divisional game.
One of the most important things Foles brings to the Jaguars is consistency. One of Bortles' biggest problems -- after turnovers -- was the fact that the Jaguars were never quite sure what they were going to get each week.
""I like it that you know what you're getting,"" coach Doug Marrone said. ""The consistency, nothing really rattles him. I think that's what I've taken [from his research on Foles]. You talk to coaches that have been around him and they say nothing ever really rattles him. He takes information. He's smart. He knows where he wants to go with the ball. He knows coverages. Those things were the things that jumped off to me outside of what you can see on the tape and playing on the big stage.""
The Jaguars gave Foles a $25 million signing bonus and his cap number in 2019 will be $12 million (it jumps to $21 million in 2020) roughly 13 months after they signed Bortles to a three-year contract extension. That deal included $16.5 million in dead money if the Jaguars were to release Bortles this year, which they did on Wednesday.
That means the Jaguars have a $28.5 million combined cap figure with Foles and Bortles. That would rank third behind Matthew Stafford ($29.5 million) and Kirk Cousins ($29 million) in terms of quarterback cap hits, yet executive vice president of football operations Tom Coughlin said he doesn't regret signing Bortles to the extension.
""It was the right thing to do,"" Coughlin said Thursday in his first media opportunity since the 2018 draft. ""The guy took us to the AFC Championship Game. There wouldn't have been anybody that would have disputed the fact that he deserved the opportunity and we played well behind and our defense played well. So what we did at that point in time is try to fortify our team around him. Obviously, we wish it was better but I have no regrets about that.""
And he certainly doesn't have any about giving Foles the most guaranteed money in franchise history, either. Especially if Foles can turn in the kind of performance he did in an early-November game five seasons ago.
""I do have one request of Nick,"" Coughlin said. ""I hope every game in 2019 is like the Oakland game of 2013, where he threw seven touchdowns, no interceptions, and had a perfect 158.3 quarterback rating.""

26273688,"The deal has been approved unanimously by the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum Stadium Authority board but still needs approval from the Oakland City Council and the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, which is considered a formality.
As part of the agreement, the Raiders will pay $7.5 million in rent for the upcoming season, and should the team's $1.9 billion, 65,000-seat domed stadium in Las Vegas not be ready in time, they have the option to pay $10.5 million to return in 2020. The Raiders expect to be in Southern Nevada by then, though.
The Coliseum Authority will also receive 100 percent of any money for naming rights after having split it 50-50 with the Raiders in the past. RingCentral had reportedly been in talks to name the Coliseum in January.
A potential snag to the agreement arose late in the process, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, with an issue over the Raiders' Alameda practice facility and team headquarters, which had been deeded to the team as part of the $200 million stadium renovation when the team returned from a 13-season run in Los Angeles in 1995.
""The Raiders were responsible for the estimated $525,000 in operating costs, taxes and debt payment on the facility,"" the Chronicle reported. ""The Raiders had wanted the Coliseum to take back the facility now and assume its costs. The Coliseum Authority wanted the Raiders to cover the facility costs until the end of the new lease.""
According to the Chronicle, the Raiders have to pay an owed $750,000 in parking fees.
Coliseum Authority executive director Scott McKibben told the Chronicle: ""It's been agreed that the property comes back to us when the Raiders leave town and stop playing football at the Coliseum.""
The Raiders, who had their rent tripled after losing a vote to move to Los Angeles in 2016, initially took their one-year, $7.5 million lease offer off the table in December after the city of Oakland filed a federal lawsuit against the Raiders and the NFL over the team's move to Las Vegas.
Raiders owner Mark Davis called the suit ""meritless and malicious"" at the time and said the team would keep all options open.
But after considering joining the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara and being blocked from playing in San Francisco at Oracle Park, the Giants' waterfront baseball park, all roads led back to Oakland and the Coliseum. The Raiders have called the Coliseum home from 1966 through 1981 and again since 1995. They played in 1960 and '61 at San Francisco's Kezar Stadium and Candlestick Park before moving to Frank Youell Field in Oakland in 1962. They played from 1982 to '94 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
The NFL had originally hoped to have an answer on the Raiders' home for 2019 by early February for scheduling purposes. The schedule is generally announced in mid-to-late April, before the draft.
The Raiders will share the Coliseum again with baseball's Athletics. Open Sundays in September for potential Raiders games on the baseball dirt infield are on the 15th (the A's play a night game on Sept. 16) and the 29th (the regular-season home finale for the A's is the 22nd), with open Mondays on Sept. 9 (when the A's begin a seven-game road trip) and Sept. 23.
The Raiders will again lose a home game to international play, as they will ""host"" Khalil Mack and the Chicago Bears in London. The team is also reportedly considering playing host to a preseason game at the home of the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders.
Davis told ESPN.com in October that he wanted to play in Oakland one last season, even with the threat of a lawsuit looming. ""Emotionally, I would say, why would I give them $3 [million], $4 [million], $5 million in rent that they're going to turn around and use to sue me?"" Davis said at the time. ""But at the same time, if they'll have us, I can't turn on the fans. I can't do it. And this is terrible negotiating I'm doing now. I'm going to get killed. But that's just the way I am. But if in fact it does get ugly and can't be bridged, we do have options.""
Raiders coach Jon Gruden made a point to celebrate the team's Christmas Eve win over the Denver Broncos last season with fans sitting in the Black Hole in the southern end zone. Raiders quarterback Derek Carr took a victory lap, slapping hands with fans. At the time, it was thought to be the last Raiders game at the Coliseum.
""It's a real football stadium -- it's dirt, grass, it has tradition,"" Gruden said the week of 2018 season finale. ""It's where some of the best games in the history of football have been played. It's where some of the best players in the history of the world played football games at. You're walking around before the Steeler game and you see Franco Harris and Lester Hayes and you think about some of the battles that they had at that place.
""There's a lot of things that happened in that stadium. Next question; I don't want to start crying about a stadium.""
Carr, meanwhile, said he ""loved"" Oakland and spoke of ""six dudes"" who jumped the barrier in an effort to join him on his lap, before being tackled by security. ""It is hard that it might be the last time, but if it is, it will always be there like, 'Man, what a time we have had there,'"" he said then.
Carr, who suffered a season-ending broken right ankle in 2016 at the Coliseum, added: ""We have had some tears of pain, joy and all those things ... we have the best fans in the world, the most loyal.
""They were on fire. It's not the professional football atmosphere where everyone is in a tie and doing their thing. It is football, it is a rough and gritty place.""
And the Raiders' home for one last ride.

Berry, 30, joined the Chiefs in 2010 as a first-round draft pick (fifth overall) from Tennessee and established himself as one of the NFL's top safeties. As a rookie he made the Pro Bowl for the first of what would be five times. He was voted first-team All-Pro three times.
But the next season also provided the first sign of things to come for Berry. He tore his ACL in the first quarter of the opener, ending his season. That was the first of four seasons in which Berry missed almost an entire season.

His 2014 season was cut short by a lymphoma diagnosis, but he returned in time for the start of the next season, a speedy comeback that might have seemed miraculous but was spurred by Berry's strong will. He worked out during the offseason despite undergoing chemotherapy treatments.
Berry's 2017 season ended after one game because of a torn Achilles tendon. He played in just three games in 2018 because of an ailing heel. Of the Chiefs' last 34 games, counting the playoffs, Berry participated in just three.
Berry has 14 interceptions in his career, returning five for touchdowns.

26275616,"For one thing, Miami is his hometown. For another, they were the only NFL team with a starting quarterback vacancy.
But neither was enough to lure Bridgewater away from the New Orleans Saints, who obviously made quite an impression on the 26-year-old quarterback after acquiring him in a trade late last August.
""I told my agents every time that I talked to them that I haven't stopped smiling since I arrived,"" said Bridgewater, who signed a one-year, $7.25 million contract worth up to $12.5 million with incentives -- even though it means spending at least one more year as a backup behind Drew Brees.
""They made playing football fun, they made learning the game fun ... and that's something I appreciate,"" Bridgewater told WWL Radio. ""I was able to be part of that for 18 weeks last season, and it was nothing but positive things that occurred.""
Free agent quarterback Teddy Bridgewater will return to the New Orleans Saints as a backup to Drew Brees, sources told ESPN on Thursday.
Bridgewater further explained on a conference call Friday that he did take time to consider the Dolphins -- including a visit to their practice facility on Wednesday -- because ""you don't want to shut all doors right away."" But he said he had a pretty good idea all along that he wanted to stay in New Orleans.
""I think for me, you ultimately play this game to compete and to start. But at the same time, I'm still 26 years old. And the way I look at it is that I'll have another opportunity to start in this league at some point,"" said Bridgewater, who began his career as a first-round draft pick and starter with the Minnesota Vikings from 2014-2015 before a devastating knee injury during the summer of 2016 sidetracked his career.
""So I look at it as this year I get the opportunity to continue to learn from a guy who's gonna be a Hall of Famer. And I get to be a part of a team that was a call away from getting to the Super Bowl. And I get to work with a coaching staff that grinds on a daily basis, that spends numerous nights at that facility to make sure their players are in the best positions to win. I look at those things, and I tell myself, 'Hey this is what I play this game for. And eventually my time will come that I can start.'""
Bridgewater missed nearly two full seasons before signing with the New York Jets last summer and proving he was healthy during the preseason. He then made his first start in three years when the Saints rested several starters in Week 17.
But he said as much as he wants to become a starter again, ""you don't want to rush yourself into any situation where you could ultimately or possibly lead back to where you are today.""
""I've always been taught that patience is the key, and for me it's about longevity,"" Bridgewater said. ""My mom always told me that the first shall be last, and the last shall be first. So I have that mindset that everything will work in my favor.""
Bridgewater did not directly say anything negative about the Dolphins' roster or chance to compete. But it's clear that they are in more of a rebuilding mode under new head coach Brian Flores.
""I wanted to make a decision where I put myself in the best situation to succeed as a man and as a player in this league,"" said Bridgewater, who said his year with the Saints was different than anything he had experienced before.
""It's very different,"" Bridgewater said. ""Just to be in a room where everyone was on the same page, from the head coach to the offensive coordinator to the quarterback coach to the starting quarterback to all the other quarterbacks in the room, to be a part of that and to see how it's run, how a well-oiled machine runs, it was great to experience that. And I'm looking forward to this year also.""
Bridgewater also didn't say that he was given any assurances of a future starting job whenever Brees retires. He said the main focus of his talk with the Saints was on this year and how they can get back in position to win a Super Bowl.
But he did say that he had discussions with coach Sean Payton before making his decision. And it's clear that Payton has been impressed with Bridgewater so far.
ESPN's Dianna Russini said she asked Payton at the NFL scouting combine which quarterback he was going after, knowing that the 40-year-old Brees' career could be over soon. And she said Payton replied, ""I have my guy. His name is Teddy Bridgewater.""
The Saints traded a third-round draft pick to the Jets last August for Bridgewater and a sixth-round pick -- both because they wanted to improve their backup QB situation and because they wanted to both evaluate and recruit Bridgewater as a possible long-term option.
So far, that investment appears to have paid off. However, Brees and Bridgewater are both scheduled to become free agents again after this season. So there will be more decisions to come at this time next year.

26237460,"In one morning, the Green Bay Packers made three moves to reshape their struggling defense, agreeing to terms with a pair of pass-rushers in Za'Darius Smith and Preston Smith plus safety Adrian Amos, according to league sources.
The deals were finalized Tuesday and can be signed when the NFL year opens at 4 p.m. ET Wednesday. NFL Network was first to report the Za'Darius Smith and Amos deals.
Za'Darius Smith will sign a four-year contract worth $66 million, including a $20 million signing bonus and $34.5 million in the first two years of the deal, according to his agents at SportsTrust Advisors.
Preston Smith will get a four-year deal worth $52 million, with $16 million fully guaranteed at signing, sources told ESPN's Josina Anderson. Smith's choices came down to the Indianapolis Colts and Packers, a source said.
Amos is slated to get a four-year, $37 million deal, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. He will earn $14 million in the first year and $21 million in the first two combined.

Packers second-year general manager Brian Gutekunst was expected to be active in free agency, especially to add pass-rushers, but this is perhaps even more than expected. The team first agreed to a deal with Za'Darius Smith, who led the Baltimore Ravens with 8.5 sacks last season, and then signed Amos away from divisional rival Chicago to provide help in the secondary. Less than two hours later, they came to a deal with Preston Smith, who had 24.5 sacks in his four seasons with the Washington Redskins.
It's a boon for second-year defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, who was retained by new coach Matt LaFleur.
After swinging these deals, the Packers released former first-round pick Nick Perry.
""We want to thank Nick for his contributions to the Green Bay Packers and the community over the last seven seasons,"" general manager Brian Gutekunst said in a statement. ""He did a tremendous job on the field, was a great teammate and a true professional. We wish Nick, his wife, Audrianna, and their family all the best.""
The move is not surprising, because Perry never replicated his 11-sack season in 2016, after which he received a five-year, $60 million deal. He had just 1.5 sacks last season, which ended prematurely because of a knee injury, and was owed $11 million in 2019 (including a $4.8 million roster bonus Friday plus a $5.2 million base salary and $1 million in bonuses).

The Packers can wipe all that money off their salary cap, but they will have to count the remaining prorated portion of his $18.5 million signing bonus (a total of $11.1 million) as dead money. If the Packers take that entire hit on this year's cap, they would still save $3,337,500 in cap space this season because his 2019 cap charge would have been $14,437,500. If they designate Perry as a post-June 1 cut, they would save $10,737,500 on this year's cap and the rest of the charge would go on next year.
The Packers' additions stood in stark contrast to the Ravens' losses the past few days. C.J. Mosley is expected to sign with the New York Jets, Terrell Suggs is heading to the Arizona Cardinals, and Eric Weddle is joining the Los Angeles Rams after being cut.
Za'Darius Smith, 26, was the sacks leader for the NFL's No. 1 defense with a career-best 8.5 last season. His 60 quarterback pressures ranked No. 17 in the NFL, according to Pro Football Focus.
A part-time starter, Smith follows the same path as Paul Kruger and Pernell McPhee, both of whom posted big sack numbers in their contract years for the Ravens and left for a big contract elsewhere.
A fourth-round pick in 2015, Smith recorded 10 sacks in his first three seasons before breaking out in 2018.
Smith underwent sports hernia surgery after the season, but he is expected to be ready for offseason workouts in the spring.
Smith's upside and efficiency are intriguing. He hit the quarterback on 25 of his 485 pass-rush snaps (5.2 percent), which is more than Kansas City Chiefs pass-rusher Dee Ford (4.7 percent).
Smith produced a career-high three sacks in last season's 21-0 shutout win at Tennessee, where the Ravens had a team-record 11. But he had only three sacks in his final 11 games, including a playoff loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.
After recording 24.5 sacks in his first four seasons with the Redskins, Preston Smith managed only four in 2018. He was not enough of a playmaker for the Redskins with just four forced fumbles -- only one in the past three seasons -- and four interceptions.
The 26-year-old is durable, however, starting every game in his first four NFL seasons. He excelled at setting the edge in the running game and would often drop into coverage to help in the passing game. His length -- he's 6-foot-6 with long arms -- and athleticism enabled him to become an immediate starter.
The Redskins selected him in the second round (38th overall) of the 2015 draft, using him to replace Brian Orakpo after he left via free agency. Smith finished with eight sacks in his rookie season, with five coming in the final three games.
Smith mostly lined up on the right side as the Redskins rotated their outside linebackers more over the past two seasons, but he would occasionally rush from the left or even play in the middle.
Amos, 25, has started 56 of the 60 games he has played in for the Bears since he was selected in the fifth round (142nd overall) of the 2015 draft.
He started all 16 games at safety for the Bears' No. 3-ranked defense last season, finishing with two interceptions, nine passes defended, a sack and 73 tackles.
Amos had an interception in the Bears' 16-15 playoff loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, picking off a Nick Foles pass intended for Nelson Agholor in the end zone in the second quarter.
Pro Football Focus ranked Amos as the eighth-best safety in the NFL last season, giving him an overall grade of 82.7.
Green Bay needed safety help. Two years ago, the Packers had a pair of veteran starting safeties, but last offseason they let Morgan Burnett leave in free agency and during the season they traded Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to the Washington Redskins for a fourth-round pick in this year's draft. After the Clinton-Dix trade, they moved veteran cornerback Tramon Williams to safety to finish out the year. Another part-time starter, Kentrell Brice, will become a restricted free agent this week.
The Packers are also signing offensive lineman Billy Turner of the Denver Broncos, a source confirmed to ESPN. He has started at tackle and guard over the years.
A source told Schefter that Turner will sign a four-year, $28 million deal with a maximum value of $29.5 million. That includes $11 million in the first year. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was first to report that deal.

26047022,"The deal, which runs through the 2022 season, is for $25.8 million and has a max value of $29 million, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Thursday. It will make Young the NFL's highest-paid nickelback.
Extremely blessed and thankful to continue my career as a Baltimore Raven, Thanks to everyone in the @Ravens organization and teammates Let's workkkkkkk!!
On Friday, Young recounted his journey from being a two-star high school recruit and how he measured as the shortest defensive back at the NFL combine in 2016.
""I called my mom and she couldn't believe it,"" said Young, 24, who was entering the final year of his rookie deal. ""She was like, 'Are you lying? Are you for real?' I'm just so happy that I can take care of [my mother and father] now.""
The extension comes just a few weeks after new Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said it would be a priority to retain the team's young talent before players reach free agency.
John Harbaugh and Greg Roman don't believe Lamar Jackson is at any more risk running down the field than he is sitting in the pocket.
Team officials targeted Young as a player to secure long-term at last month's personnel meetings, and negotiations took about two weeks to complete.
""This is a big contract,"" coach John Harbaugh said. ""This is a record-setting number. It's not something you enter into lightly at all. But the math works because of who the player is.""
Young showed toughness in being a key member of the NFL's fifth-ranked pass defense last season. Despite battling a sports hernia for nearly half the season, Young recorded 36 tackles, two sacks, an interception and five pass breakups. He didn't play in Baltimore's playoff loss to the Los Angeles Chargers and underwent surgery after the season.
A fourth-round pick in 2016, Young stepped up as a playmaker last season. He scored two touchdowns off fumble recoveries, becoming one of four players to score multiple defensive touchdowns in 2018. His 62-yard touchdown sealed a 22-10 upset of the Chargers in Week 16.
""I've been here 23 years and the fastest way to lose a game is to play poorly in the secondary,"" DeCosta said. ""We've been blessed to have a lot of good corners play here over the years and this is a guy who compares to all of them.""
Other Ravens players who are candidates for extensions before their rookie deals are complete are outside linebacker Matthew Judon and offensive tackle Ronnie Stanley.

26227336,"Former Miami Dolphins wide receiver Danny Amendola has signed with the Detroit Lions, the team announced Monday.
A source told ESPN's Dianna Russini that the deal is for one year, $4.5 million and could be worth up to $5.75 million.
The Lions need a slot receiver after trading Golden Tate to the Philadelphia Eagles at the trade deadline last year. Amendola has 391 catches when lined up in the slot since his first full season in the NFL in 2009, the second-most in the NFL in that time behind Wes Welker, according to ESPN Stats & Information.
In their search for a replacement for Tate, the Lions had gone through Bruce Ellington, TJ Jones and Brandon Powell. Of the three, only Powell, an undrafted free agent from Florida last year, is signed by the Lions for 2019.
The signing also reunites Amendola with Lions general manager Bob Quinn and coach Matt Patricia from their time with the New England Patriots.
The Lions are going to be looking for a new starting cornerback as the club is releasing Nevin Lawson days before the start of the new league year, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
We're keeping track of every notable signing, trade and cut throughout the month, with analysis from our experts.
Amendola, 33, continued to show his toughness and knack for finding open zones out of the slot with the Dolphins, leading the team in receiving last season with 575 yards on 59 catches.
He was released Friday, as the Dolphins didn't see him as a long-term fit at his price for a team that is in rebuilding mode, although they did like the leadership that he brought to the locker room in his only season in Miami. The Dolphins saved $6 million in salary-cap space by releasing Amendola, who signed a two-year deal last March for $12 million.
An 11-year veteran, Amendola has had a nice career after starting as an undrafted free agent out of Texas Tech in 2008. He has caught 485 passes for 4,684 yards and 20 touchdowns while also playing for the Rams and Patriots, with whom he won two Super Bowl rings but left for a bigger payday after taking pay cuts in each of his final three seasons with the team.
Amendola's time in New England, from 2013 to 2017, overlapped with Patricia's time as defensive coordinator and part of Quinn's time with the club.
Amendola, who started more than eight games for the first time in his career last season, has played 16 games in a season just twice (2010, '14).

26004808,"The announcement came Friday, seemingly out of nowhere. Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid have settled their joint collusion grievance with the NFL, ending with little fanfare a case that has transcended the sport into the cultural debates of the country. Let's read between the lines into what we know, what we think we know -- and what we might never know.
Kaepernick first filed the grievance in October 2017, saying that NFL teams were in violation of the anti-collusion clause of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA). In the grievance, Kaepernick's attorney claimed he had gone unsigned because the NFL and its owners ""colluded to deprive Mr. Kaepernick of employment rights in retaliation for Mr. Kaepernick's leadership and advocacy for equality and social justice and his bringing awareness to peculiar institutions still undermining racial equality in the United States.""
In a joint statement Friday, the NFL, Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid say they have resolved the collusion grievances filed by the players against the league.
Safety Eric Reid is returning to the Carolina Panthers, signing a three-year contract on Monday.
Alliance of American Football co-founder Bill Polian told The Athletic that the league spoke with quarterbacks Colin Kaepernick and Tim Tebow about joining the league, but both declined.
The case was about to reach a new level. Arbitrator Stephen Burbank was going to conduct a hearing to begin resolving the issue, probably early this spring. That would have forced both sides into a semi-public airing of grievances that could have exposed inner workings of league business, along with the details of depositions attorneys have taken with high-level executives and some owners.
The latter, most likely. It's also likely that the NFL viewed a settlement as an important milestone in moving past a controversy that drew the ire of President Donald Trump, among others. But the facts are eye-opening. Kaepernick began taking a knee during the national anthem in 2016 to protest police brutality and system racism. In a league that is in perpetual need of quarterback depth, Kaepernick isn't known to have received a single firm contract offer since he parted ways with the San Francisco 49ers in May 2017.
Of course, but the CBA states explicitly that lack of opportunity cannot in itself be evidence of collusion. From the CBA: ""The failure by a club or clubs to negotiate, to submit offer sheets, or to sign contracts with restricted free agents or transition players, or to negotiate, make offers, or sign contracts for the playing services of such players or unrestricted free agents, shall not, by itself or in combination only with evidence about the playing skills of the player(s) not receiving any such offer or contract, satisfy the burden of proof set forth ...""
They needed to show that a ""club, its employees or agents"" had ""entered into an agreement"" to restrict or limit whether to offer them a contract, according to the CBA. In other words, they needed a ""smoking gun,"" something league officials could easily have avoided even if they did engage in a conspiracy to keep Kaepernick and later Reid out of the league.
The only accurate answer is we don't know. And because the agreement requires complete confidentiality on both sides, we might never know. But collusion, if found, can carry significant penalties. Had he found the league guilty, Burbank would have determined compensatory damages -- the amount a player had been damaged by the collusion. The CBA then calls for Burbank to double those damages in cases of first offense and triple them for a second offense.
Not unless someone breaks the confidentiality agreement. There is a small possibility that the Green Bay Packers' annual release of their accounting books could provide a clue. Each team would contribute to any financial settlement that is agreed upon, but it's more likely that the money would be deducted from league revenues rather than be a line-item charge.
Not necessarily. Even if he had won the grievance, the CBA does not require him to be signed. The claim of collusion probably isn't what kept Kaepernick off a roster. Teams appeared to have made up their mind after the 2016 season, long before Kaepernick filed the claim. The NFL has no mechanism to force the signing of a player, and it is it is hard to conceive that the settlement included a job guarantee.

He has rarely talked publicly, at least about football, since leaving the 49ers. But in one of his few public comments, in September 2017, he affirmed his desire to continue playing. Kaepernick is known to have continued football-centric workouts, and at 31, he is still relatively young for a quarterback. The new Alliance of American Football reached out to gauge his interest in playing this spring, according to co-founder Bill Polian, but he ultimately did not sign a contract.
Reid joined Kaepernick's grievance in May 2018 after he went unsigned during the early part of free agency. He agreed to terms with the Panthers in September 2018 and recently signed a three-year contract extension. Reid had joined Kaepernick in kneeling during the national anthem when both players were with the 49ers.
It is the end of the grievance process, and after two years away from the game, Kaepernick faces longer odds to resume his career in a productive way. But as long as Kaepernick is young enough and in shape, it will be fair to question why teams are not demonstrating interest.

26130769,"Barring any last-minute snags, the Jacksonville Jaguars are expected to sign free-agent quarterback Nick Foles to a multiyear contract when the new league year opens next week, according to sources.
Teams are not allowed to talk deals with free agents until March 11, and no deals can be announced until the start of the new league year on March 13.
The Jaguars are expected to release quarterback Blake Bortles and install Foles as their starter. Jacksonville will have to pay $6.5 million of Bortles' 2019 salary, which was fully guaranteed when he signed his current contract last year.
The Jaguars' expected signing of Foles was first reported by Philly.com.
Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said Wednesday that the team would not place the franchise tag on Foles, leaving him a free agent.
""He deserves an opportunity to lead a team,"" Roseman said.
The Jaguars need help elsewhere on offense, and signing Foles gives them the best chance to upgrade at their most needed positions.
The Eagles won't be using the franchise tag on Nick Foles. What is his best fit in free agency? What will the Eagles do for a backup QB?
The Jaguars are looking to reach agreements on trades of running back Carlos Hyde and defensive tackle Malik Jackson that can be processed when the league year opens March 13, sources told ESPN.
The organization had been entertaining the idea of placing the tag on Foles to facilitate a trade, but the decision likely means they were unable to find a deal that worked. By letting him walk, the Eagles are expected to receive a compensatory pick as high as a third-rounder in 2020.
Foles' potential market shrank when the Denver Broncos traded for Joe Flacco, leaving Jacksonville as Foles' only known suitor. The Jaguars hired John DeFilippo as their offensive coordinator in January. DeFilippo was Foles' quarterbacks coach with the Eagles in 2017.
Foles' primary objective this offseason was to find a team he could call his own following two incredible seasons as Carson Wentz's backup. He opted out of his contract with the Eagles by paying them back $2 million in February.
""I would love to lead a team,"" Foles said at the close of the 2018 season. ""The starter thing, leading a team, impacting a locker room ... that's why we play the game -- to impact people, to create an atmosphere.""
Originally drafted by the Eagles in the third round in 2012, Foles was traded to the St. Louis Rams before the 2015 season after a few up-and-down years in Philly and contemplated retirement following a difficult year in St. Louis. Instead, he rejoined coach Andy Reid as a backup with the Kansas City Chiefs before returning to Philly in a similar role in 2017.
A signing that received little attention at the time proved to be one of the most important in Eagles history, as Foles took over for Wentz down the stretch that season and helped the team to its first Super Bowl title. He completed 73 percent of his passes -- an NFL single-season record -- and threw six touchdowns with one interception during that playoff run en route to being named Super Bowl MVP.
He proved that it was no fluke by saving the Eagles' season a second time this past year, helping them to three straight wins in place of an injured Wentz to close the regular season and a road victory over the Chicago Bears in the wild-card round.
The Jaguars finished 5-11 in 2018, and owner Shad Khan brought back executive VP of football operations Tom Coughlin, GM Dave Caldwell and coach Doug Marrone for 2019, but he said he expects significant improvement. Coughlin and Caldwell apparently believe that signing Foles instead of drafting a rookie gives them the best chance to return to the playoffs.
Although the Jaguars' defense did not sack the quarterback and force turnovers in 2018 at the rate it did in 2017, the unit still finished in the top five in total defense, pass defense and scoring defense. All but two -- and possibly three -- starters are expected to return in 2019.
With Foles as the starter, the Jaguars can concentrate on adding playmakers on offense at tight end and receiver and addressing the right side of the offensive line in the early rounds of the draft.
Foles, 30, has completed 62 percent of his passes in 54 career games, with 68 touchdowns and 33 interceptions. He has the sixth-best career postseason passer rating (98.8) in NFL history.

26121425,"The Chiefs intend to switch their base defensive scheme to a 4-3 under new coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, which likely would mean a move to defensive end for Ford, who played that position in college before moving to linebacker for Kansas City.
According to NFL Next Gen Stats, Dee Ford had 69 QB pressures last season, second-most in a single season in the three seasons of data collected.
Most QB Pressures in Single Season Since 2016
The one-year franchise tender for linebackers is expected to be about $15.8 million, although an exact amount has yet to be set. Ford made about $8.7 million last season after the Chiefs exercised the fifth-year option of the contract he signed as a rookie in 2014.
Ford, who will turn 28 on March 19, finally became the player in 2018 that the Chiefs envisioned when they drafted him in the first round out of Auburn. He started all 16 games for the first time in his career and had a career-high 13 sacks. He also was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the first time.
He said late in the regular season that he would sign the one-year franchise tender if selected, calling the decision a ""no-brainer."" And the team's decision to do so didn't come as a surprise.
Tuesday is the deadline for NFL teams to franchise players, and six teams already have locked down their stars.
""When we drafted Dee a few years ago, all those things that we envisioned for him, he kind of showed that he was that player,"" general manager Brett Veach said recently. ""We are excited about bringing him back.""
In his first four seasons, Ford had a total of 17.5 sacks -- 10 of which came during a nine-game stretch in 2016. Otherwise, until 2018, Ford had 7.5 sacks to show for his other 42 games.
Ford ended his best season with his least productive game. He had no sacks or tackles in the AFC Championship Game loss to the New England Patriots, and he was penalized for lining up offside on a play that negated an interception in the final minute of the fourth quarter.
The interception could have allowed the Chiefs, who had a four-point lead at the time, to run out the clock. Instead, the Patriots continued their drive to a go-ahead touchdown and eventually won in overtime.

Wake, who turned 37 in January, was still one of the Dolphins' most complete defensive players in 2018. He was second on the team with six sacks, and he was one of Miami's best run defenders.
The five-time Pro Bowl selection is known for following a strict diet, lifestyle and workout routine. He keeps himself in incredible shape, and he figures that -- and the late start to his NFL career -- allows him to play at a high level longer than most players.

The Dolphins signed Wake in 2009 after he dominated CFL competition with the BC Lions, where he won defensive player of the year for two consecutive seasons. He made an immediate impact in Miami and has amassed 98 sacks -- second in franchise history behind Jason Taylor (131).
Wake, who had five sacks in the second half of last season, decided late in the 2018 season that he felt good enough to return for an 11th NFL campaign.

26004715,"Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and current Carolina Panthers safety Eric Reid have reached a settlement with the NFL concerning their collusion grievances against the league, it was announced Friday.
""For the past several months, counsel for Mr. Kaepernick and Mr. Reid have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL,"" attorney Mark Geragos and the NFL said in a joint statement issued Friday. ""As a result of those discussions, the parties have decided to resolve the pending grievances. The resolution of this matter is subject to a confidentiality agreement so there will be no further comment by any party.""
Kaepernick filed a grievance in October 2017 under the collective bargaining agreement, alleging collusion against signing him to an NFL contract.
Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid have settled their collusion grievances with the NFL. How did we get here, and what happens now?
Kaepernick stood his ground -- and the NFL finally backed down.
Despite the specifics, Friday's settlement may mean Kaepernick, 31, won't play another down in the NFL. And if that's the result, it's completely fine.
The filing, which demanded an arbitration hearing on the matter, said the NFL and its owners ""have colluded to deprive Mr. Kaepernick of employment rights in retaliation for Mr. Kaepernick's leadership and advocacy for equality and social justice and his bringing awareness to peculiar institutions still undermining racial equality in the United States.""
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, several owners and at least two other NFL executives were selected to be deposed and asked to turn over all cellphone records and emails in relation to Kaepernick's case against the NFL.
Kaepernick drew national attention in 2016 when he knelt during the national anthem before games to protest social injustice. His kneeling led to a movement that has spread throughout the league while also being vilified by some, including President Donald Trump.
Reid was the first player to join Kaepernick in kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial inequality and police brutality.
Kaepernick has not been with an NFL team since severing his contract with the 49ers in March 2017. Reid, who played for the 49ers from 2013 to 2017, signed with the Panthers before the team's fourth game of the 2018 season and received a three-year deal earlier this week worth more than $22 million.
Basketball Hall of Famer and activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar says Colin Kaepernick's settlement of a collusion case against the NFL is a victory for the quarterback.
Abdul-Jabbar said he believes that Kaepernick still wants to play in the NFL. At a NBA Hall of Fame event Friday at All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, North Carolina, Abdul-Jabbar said Kaepernick ""had a statement that he had to make through his demonstrations, but he's a quarterback and I think he should be working.""
Abdul-Jabbar, a winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, was criticized when he changed his name from Lew Alcindor as a statement of his Muslim faith and heard Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speak in the mid-1960s.
Abdul-Jabbar said Kaepernick is ""a lot better than a number of the quarterbacks I see that have jobs now. So something's wrong here.""
-- The Associated Press
Kaepernick and Reid faced a difficult challenge to meet the burden of proof for collusion as defined in the league's CBA. The statute makes clear that unemployment alone does not mean collusion occurred.
According to the CBA: ""The failure by a club or clubs to negotiate, to submit offer sheets, or to sign contracts with restricted free agents or transition players, or to negotiate, make offers, or sign contracts for the playing services of such players or unrestricted free agents, shall not, by itself or in combination only with evidence about the playing skills of the player(s) not receiving any such offer or contract, satisfy the burden of proof set forth.""
To prove collusion, according to the CBA, Kaepernick and Reid would have had to show that a ""club, its employees or agents"" had ""entered into an agreement"" to restrict or limit whether to offer them a contract.
Kaepernick did not go through the NFL Players Association in filing the grievance but instead hired Geragos, who has represented several high-profile clients, including Michael Jackson, former NASCAR driver Jeremy Mayfield and musician Chris Brown. The NFLPA offered Kaepernick its support and reiterated its readiness to assist him, ""as we do all players.""
The NFLPA on Friday said that while it did not know the details of the settlement, it supported the decision by Kaepernick and Reid.
""We continuously supported Colin and Eric from the start of their protests, participated with their lawyers throughout their legal proceedings and were prepared to participate in the upcoming trial in pursuit of both truth and justice for what we believe the NFL and its clubs did to them,"" the statement said. ""We are glad that Eric has earned a job and a new contract, and we continue to hope that Colin gets his opportunity as well.""
In May, the NFLPA filed a grievance against the NFL on Reid's behalf, alleging that team owners and the league, influenced by Trump, colluded to prevent his employment because of his protests.
Reid continued to kneel last season after signing with the Panthers. It did not become a distraction, and Reid was supported by his teammates, although no other players knelt.
""We always knew he was a solid football player, and he showed it to us,"" coach Ron Rivera told the team website.
Reid started the final 13 games last season, finishing with 73 tackles, five passes defensed, one interception and one sack.
He said he was drug tested seven times last season. He implied that the tests were not random, as stated in the CBA.
""The NFL released a statement saying I was not targeted, and I believe otherwise,"" Reid has said.

Sitton is likely to wind up with the New York Jets, a source tells ESPN's Adam Schefter. There he would reunite with Jets coach Adam Gase, formerly of the Dolphins.
Sitton, 32, signed a two-year, $13.5 million deal with the Dolphins last March with hopes of fortifying Miami's interior offensive line. Sitton's season ended shortly after it started when he tore his rotator cuff in Week 1 versus Tennessee.
Sitton had surgery and was placed on injured reserve in September.
The 6-foot-3, 320-pound veteran guard is a four-time Pro Bowler who has played 11 NFL seasons, including his first eight in Green Bay.

26242795,"The Patriots had acquired Patterson and a 2018 sixth-round pick from the Oakland Raiders in exchange for a 2018 fifth-round pick in March 2018. The deal was sparked, in part, by Patterson's $3 million base salary and $250,000 workout bonus, which the Raiders deemed too high for a player whose primary contributions came as a kickoff returner.
But the salary was deemed tenable by Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who places a high priority on special teams.

As it turned out, Patterson helped the Patriots in multiple spots over the course of the 2018 season as a ""slash""-type option. At one point, he took handoffs as a traditional running back when the team had a run of injuries at the position.
In 15 regular-season games, with five starts, Patterson totaled 42 rushing attempts for 228 yards, with one touchdown. He added 21 receptions for 247 yards and three touchdowns. As for kickoff returns, he had 23 for 663 yards (28.8 avg.) and one touchdown, which came against the Bears.
The 6-foot-2, 228-pound Patterson, who turns 28 on March 17, entered the NFL as a first-round draft choice (29th overall) of the Minnesota Vikings in 2013. He spent four years in Minnesota before signing with the Raiders as a free agent before the 2017 season.

The Raiders also created cap room by releasing quarterback AJ McCarron.
Nelson, who turns 34 on May 31, caught 63 passes for 739 yards and 3 touchdowns over 15 games in a disjointed, injury-plagued lone season for Oakland.
""Normally, when you hand out a bonus for next year's season, there's a pretty good chance those guys are coming back,"" Gruden said Dec. 28. ""If you watched Jordy play carefully the last four weeks when he's been healthy, you see what he's capable of doing.

The additions of receiver Antonio Brown in a trade and Tyrell Williams in free agency seemingly made Nelson expendable.
Williams signed a deal worth $47 million with $22 million guaranteed, a source told Schefter. The Raiders gave Brown a new three-year deal worth up to $54.125 million, with $30.125 million guaranteed, a source told Schefter.
Nelson would have seen his base salary of $3 million for 2019 become fully guaranteed on Sunday, and he had a salary-cap number of more than $5.368 million. Nelson, who dealt with a knee issue last season, will cost Oakland $1.8 million in dead money.
Nelson spent the first 10 years of his career with the Green Bay Packers. Late last season, Nelson said he was open to playing for the Raiders again in 2019.
""It's not always the player's decision, but yeah, that's the plan,"" he said with a smile. ""We've enjoyed our time out here so far, enjoyed being with the team and starting the rebuilding process and being a part of that, so yeah, I believe that's the plan.""
Receivers on the Raiders roster now are Brown, Williams, Seth Roberts, Marcell Ateman, Keon Hatcher, Saeed Blacknall and Rashard Davis. Roberts, long rumored to be a cut candidate, carries a cap number of $4.65 million with a base salary of $4.45 million for 2019 and no dead money concerns.
McCarron, who came to the Raiders in a trade with the Buffalo Bills for a fifth-round draft pick on Sept. 1, appeared in mop-up duty in two games and completed 1 of 3 passes for 8 yards while taking a sack. His $1.9 million base salary would have been guaranteed on Sunday, though a $3 million roster bonus would have been guaranteed on Friday.
By cutting McCarron, the Raiders saved $5 million in cap space. Nathan Peterman, who is due to make $645,000 in base salary in 2019, is the lone backup quarterback to Derek Carr.
The move also would seem to put Oakland in the market for another quarterback, be it in free agency, where the likes of Blake Bortles and Colin Kaepernick reside, or the draft. The Raiders have eight picks, including four selections in the first 35, and while Gruden has been linked to both Oklahoma's Kyler Murray and Ohio State's Dwayne Haskins, he and his staff coached Missouri's Drew Lock, Duke's Daniel Jones, North Carolina State's Ryan Finley and Penn State's Trace McSorley in the Senior Bowl in January.

26242951,"The New York Giants have agreed to trade Odell Beckham Jr. to the Cleveland Browns, a source confirmed to ESPN's Adam Schefter, in a blockbuster deal that sends the star receiver out of New York less than a year after he signed a massive contract with the team.
The Giants will receive the Browns' first-round pick (No. 17 overall) and second third-round pick (95th overall) in next month's draft, along with safety Jabrill Peppers, the source said.
In a text message to ESPN's Josina Anderson, Beckham simply said of the trade, ""Wow.""
A source told ESPN's Pat McManamon that the Browns and Giants will combine last week's Olivier Vernon-Kevin Zeitler trade and the Beckham deal into one. The terms will have the Browns getting Beckham and Vernon for Zeitler, Peppers and the picks included in the Beckham trade. The swap of fourth- and fifth-round picks earlier agreed to in the Vernon-Zeitler deal (132nd overall to Cleveland and 155th overall to New York) will not be part of the final trade.
The superstar receiver is headed to Cleveland, leaving behind a total rebuild in New York. Bill Barnwell dissects both sides of the deal.
The Giants can no longer straddle the line of restocking on the fly or trying to compete. They are starting over, even if it's a year too late.
From questions of ""what is going on?"" to claims of ""fake news,"" players are showing their surprise at New York's stunning trade of its star receiver to Cleveland.
Beckham told Anderson that current Browns receiver and former LSU teammate Jarvis Landry called him and said Cleveland general manager John Dorsey and first-year coach Freddie Kitchens wanted Beckham badly. Beckham then said Giants GM Dave Gettleman called him and said, ""I am trading you to the Browns.""
Beckham, 26, signed a five-year deal with the Giants worth up to $98.5 million in August. It made him the highest-paid receiver in the NFL at the time and seemed to cement his place on the Giants' roster.
But after another disastrous season in which the Giants flopped at 5-11 and Beckham had several incidents that angered the team's brass, the Giants decided to move him after paying out $21.5 million for 12 games. The trade adds $16 million in dead money to their running total.
The Giants weren't shopping Beckham this offseason. But they were willing to listen to offers, and there were teams interested in his services. Among them were the Browns and San Francisco 49ers, according to sources.
Gettleman hadn't indicated publicly that the Giants were interested in a deal, saying at his end-of-year news conference and again at the NFL scouting combine last month: ""We didn't sign Odell to trade him. OK?""

That changed Tuesday, as Dorsey came up with a package the Giants couldn't resist.
""John Dorsey is officially a genius ..."" Browns defensive back Damarious Randall tweeted.
Beckham will join Landry, his good friend, to form arguably the top receiving tandem in the league, which no doubt will delight second-year quarterback and 2018 No. 1 draft pick Baker Mayfield. Beckham and Mayfield are already tight; they spent part of last summer working out in California with Landry, who has been campaigning since he arrived in Cleveland for his former college teammate to join him.
When news of the agreement broke, Mayfield posted on Twitter a photo of him shaking hands with Beckham. ""Movement"" was the caption.
Beckham and Landry, who have seven Pro Bowl selections between them, recorded 288 receptions apiece in their first three NFL seasons. Only Michael Thomas of the New Orleans Saints recorded more (321).
Beckham has been explosive throughout his NFL career; his 12 touchdown catches with at least 20 yards after the catch are the most in the league since 2014. Landry has been more of a short-to-intermediate-route receiver, with a career average target depth of 7.2 yards, which ranks 87th out of 92 wide receivers with at least 200 targets in that span (since t2014).
Browns receivers coach Adam Henry coached both receivers at LSU.

They'll lead an emerging offense that includes running back Nick Chubb, who last season had the most rushing yards ever by a Browns rookie (996), and David Njoku, who in 2018 finished in the top 10 among tight ends in receptions (56) and receiving yards (639).
Cleveland has been busy this offseason. It signed running back Kareem Hunt to a one-year deal (he's currently on the commissioner's exempt list), traded for Vernon and agreed to a deal with free-agent defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson.
On Wednesday, the Browns reached agreement with former Chiefs tight end Demetrius Harris on a two-year deal, a source told Schefter. Harris had 12 catches for 164 yards and three TDs last season.
New York appears to be in rebuilding mode, trading Vernon, not putting a franchise tag on safety Landon Collins (who will sign with the Washington Redskins) and dealing its top playmaker.
The Giants now have three of the top 37 draft picks in April and 12 overall. Peppers, who is from New Jersey, will help fill the void left by Collins' departure. A first-round pick in 2017, he struggled as a rookie but bounced back and played well last season.
News of the Beckham deal, which was first reported by NFL Network, had an immediate impact in Las Vegas. Cleveland's odds to win the Super Bowl went from 25-1 to 14-1 at Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook. Its odds to win the AFC went from 12-1 to 7-1, behind those of only Kansas City and New England (3-1).
The Browns went 7-8-1 last season after not winning a game in 2017. They haven't reached the playoffs since 2002.
Browns pass-rusher Myles Garrett, when asked whether the Browns are the team to beat in the AFC North, told NFL Network, ""Absolutely. I think the tide has turned, and we can't wait to get out there and prove it.""
Ohio native LeBron James reacted on Instagram to the deal, saying: ""OH MY!!!! S*#% just got REAL!!"" Beckham responded: ""Lemme hold the crib down.""
Meanwhile, New York's Super Bowl odds went from 40-1 to 80-1, and its NFC title odds from 20-1 to 40-1, according to Westgate.

26076476,"Which teams will be the most aggressive when the free-agency market opens?
NFL Nation reporters assess how active all 32 teams will be when the new league year kicks off on March 13, based on the following scale:


1. Aggressive
2. Active, but not breaking the bank
3. Not as active as fans might hope
Let's start with the teams that will be the most active, or skip to your favorite team below:

They already have been aggressive in free agency, and they're not expected to slow down. They should have more than $40 million in cap space and likely will use most of it to rebound from a disappointing 3-13 season. They've already signed CB Robert Alford, DE Brooks Reed and TE Charles Clay -- all of whom fill needs. But Arizona still has gaps at wide receiver and on the offensive line. General manager Steve Keim is set on bouncing back this season by whatever means necessary. The Cardinals have the No. 1 overall pick and will be aggressive in the draft, but Keim and new coach Kliff Kingsbury will use free agency to put a bandage on immediate needs, especially on offense, while using the draft to build long term. Keim has found success throughout his career on one-year ""prove it"" deals with experienced veterans, so look for more of those this offseason. -- Josh Weinfuss

John Dorsey has been uber-aggressive from the day he took over as the Browns' general manager. It would be fool's gold to believe that Dorsey will not be aggressive in free agency with almost $80 million in salary-cap space. He has to keep some of that money for his players (Damarious Randall), but Dorsey could strengthen the team at left tackle, receiver, linebacker and perhaps cornerback with the cap space with which he has to work. -- Pat McManamon

Prepare for a dizzying number of signings over the next few weeks. The Jets have $102 million in cap space, and they'll need it because they have a league-high 26 players headed to unrestricted free agency. After 14 wins in the past three seasons, the Jets' roster needs major help on both sides of the ball. They will pursue running back Le'Veon Bell and the best available edge rusher, which could be Dante Fowler, Trey Flowers or Anthony Barr. Upgrading the offensive line is a must, and they can start by going after centers Matt Paradis (Broncos) or Mitch Morse (Chiefs). The offseason goal is to improve Sam Darnold's supporting cast. -- Rich Cimini

First-year general manager Eric DeCosta has already recited Ozzie Newsome's mantra of ""right player, right price,"" which means the Ravens are looking for the best values. Baltimore has around $26 million in cap space after cutting wide receiver Michael Crabtree. That number can nearly double when the trading of quarterback Joe Flacco ($10.5 million in cap savings) becomes official on March 13 and the possible cutting of cornerback Jimmy Smith ($9.5 million) and safety Eric Weddle ($7.5 million). Even if the Ravens retain these veterans (especially if some agree to pay cuts), the expectation is that Baltimore will add an edge rusher, interior offensive lineman, running back and backup quarterback in free agency. But it would be a surprise if DeCosta makes a splash like signing Le'Veon Bell (although you can't rule it out entirely). -- Jamison Hensley

General manager Brandon Beane has about $80 million in cap space after spending his first two seasons shedding salary and swallowing a huge amount of dead money. That had some fans anticipating a spending spree this offseason, especially to bolster the offense around quarterback Josh Allen, but Beane wrote in a February letter to season-ticket holders that he would be ""active"" but ""calculated"" in the free-agent market and prefers to re-sign homegrown players in future years. Buffalo already signed free-agent offensive lineman Spencer Long to a three-year contract after he was cut by the Jets, and the team figures to continue looking for veteran pieces to add along the offensive line, wide receiver, tight end and potentially cornerback. -- Mike Rodak

After a five-win season in 2017 and a six-win season in 2018, the Broncos have more needs than they can fill in free agency with their current cap space -- projected at just over $37 million before the Joe Flacco deal, and his $18.5 million cap hit, is added on March 13. Flacco's cap hit will be the third biggest until the team decides what to do with Case Keenum, who is No. 2 ($21 million). So, they will be selective in free agency, including trying to sign some of their own free agents, such as center Matt Paradis. They've already told linebacker Brandon Marshall they do not expect to pay his bonus. Wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, defensive end Derek Wolfe and cornerback Chris Harris Jr. have similar bonuses due. It likely means this roster is getting younger and they will be as active as they can be with their limited space. -- Jeff Legwold

GM Bob Quinn is focused on playmakers, and depending on what the market looks like at certain positions (wide receiver, tight end, defensive end, linebacker, cornerback), Detroit should be in play for mid- to high-level players at those positions. Quinn hasn't shown to be someone who overpays, but based on previous years, he is willing to pay for positions of need (see Marvin Jones, Rick Wagner and T.J. Lang during his tenure). Don't be surprised to see Quinn make a couple of strong free-agent moves (Trey Flowers would be a player to look at if he makes it to free agency) and then bolster with reasonably priced depth. -- Michael Rothstein

The Packers don't have many of their own free agents who are must-sign players, so that gives GM Brian Gutekunst even more freedom with his $35 million in cap space. The question is, does he make one big signing or a handful of lower-priced moves? In his first offseason as GM last year, he went the midlevel free-agent route with Jimmy Graham ($10 million per year), Muhammad Wilkerson ($5 million) and Tramon Williams ($5 million). Given the multitude of holes on his roster, perhaps he'd go for quantity once again. -- Rob Demovsky

Unlike last season when Houston attempted to make a big free-agent splash, the Texans have three draft picks in the first two rounds, which means they will likely use those to fill a few holes instead of needing to go all-out in free agency. But Houston does have three big free agents on defense -- defensive end/outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney, safety Tyrann Mathieu and cornerback Kareem Jackson -- and will try to re-sign all three if the price is right. -- Sarah Barshop
To get more from their offense and get a rebound from their new starting QB, the Broncos will draw from their past.
Philadelphia is losing its security blanket in Nick Foles, but as we've learned, the Eagles will invest in the most important position in football.

The Colts have an NFL-high of about $110 million in salary-cap space to try to address needs at pass-rusher, safety and receiver. Don't get too excited, though. Colts GM Chris Ballard believes in taking a methodical approach to free agency. They'll be active, but Ballard has said several times they have a cap on how much they'll spend on a player. ""We put a value on a player, and when it gets out of our reach I just think we are comfortable enough to sleep at night saying we are going to find an answer,"" Ballard said. ""... We are going to find an answer, whether it's in that first window of free agency, maybe it's the second window, maybe it's the draft, maybe it's after the draft, maybe it's at the cut-down day. There are times to acquire players at all points during the season."" -- Mike Wells

GM Dave Caldwell said at the combine that the Jaguars can be aggressive in free agency, and he's right -- but in spots. They will aggressively pursue Nick Foles or another veteran quarterback who they feel comfortable going with if they are unable to to get who they want in the draft. But as far as signing several high-priced guys? That's not something to expect. They can pick and choose a spot -- offensive line most likely -- but don't expect the kind of haul they got in 2017 with Calais Campbell, A.J. Bouye and Barry Church. -- Mike DiRocco

Free agency might look a lot like it did for the Chiefs last year, when they splurged on wide receiver Sammy Watkins and linebacker Anthony Hitchens. It will likely be more about quality than quantity. -- Adam Teicher

The Chargers traditionally are selective in free agency, waiting for things to calm down after the first few days of high-dollar investments on players before making a move. This year likely will not be any different. The Chargers are in the bottom half of the NFL in terms of cap space ($25.8 million), but could take a calculated risk on a player at a position of need like linebacker or defensive lineman. -- Eric Williams

The Rams proved last offseason when they signed defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh to a one-year, $14 million contract that they are more than willing to approach free agency aggressively. This offseason, with quarterback Jared Goff still on his rookie contract, expect them to continue to be a aggressive -- but less so than a year ago because of salary-cap space, coupled with the need to fill a few starting roles. With slightly more than $24.4 million available in cap space, the Rams must settle a need for a starting-caliber pass-rusher, defensive tackle and safety. -- Lindsey Thiry

Think of the Patriots' approach last year, and how they lost more free agents than they signed, yet they still wound up winning the Super Bowl. Why change what works for them? The approach also helped them add four compensatory draft picks for 2019 -- two third-rounders, a sixth-rounder and a seventh-rounder. The expectation is more of the same, with the club exploring options in the trade market while also taking a closer look at those released by teams who wouldn't count against the compensatory draft pick formula. -- Mike Reiss

The Saints should probably be less active this year, with only $10 million to $12 million in cap space. But that has never been their style in the Mickey Loomis-Sean Payton era. Plus, they don't have any draft picks in Rounds 1, 3 or 4 this year. Their top priority should be adding a pass-catcher, either at tight end or slot receiver. They'll also need to either re-sign DE Alex Okafor or spend decent money on a replacement for him, among other priorities. -- Mike Triplett

The Giants have an exorbitant amount of needs and not a tremendous amount of cap space. That should lead to a chunk of signings, although not at the top of the market. Expect the Giants to concentrate on their defense, from front to back. -- Jordan Raanan

With a lean toward aggressiveness, because if you know anything about coach Jon Gruden, you don't know what he's truly thinking. And there is no résumé for GM Mike Mayock. Still, the Raiders have nearly $74.5 million in cap space, per OverTheCap.com, and, as Mayock said, needs all over the roster, so it's not like one splashy signing (Le'Veon Bell) will solve everything. Or, as Gruden said at the combine, ""Every veteran player comes with a price tag. These contracts are very expensive, so you have to measure the financial part of things as well as, 'Does he fit your scheme and fit your operation?'"" -- Paul Gutierrez

The Eagles have about $2 million in cap space right now, but they'll free up some room between now and the start of the league year in order to be modest players. Running back and a deep threat at receiver are among the priorities. -- Tim McManus

The Niners figure to have around $70 million in cap space, which would allow them to fall into the aggressive category should they so choose. But general manager John Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan won't spend for the sake of it. That means the approach will probably be similar to what it was in 2018 when San Francisco had a couple of primary targets (center Weston Richburg and running back Jerick McKinnon) it was willing to spend big on to land. This year could feature a bit more star power in terms of the names, but the strategy will likely feel familiar unless some top edge rushers unexpectedly avoid the franchise tag, which could change the calculus. -- Nick Wagoner

Not since Cary Williams in 2015 have the Seahawks brought in an outside free agent with a multiyear deal worth more than $5 million on average. ""Active, but not breaking the bank"" has been general manager John Schneider's M.O. since then. Yes, the Seahawks are projected to have more than $50 million in 2019 cap space and can free up a few more million by releasing Barkevious Mingo and/or Jaron Brown. But remember, a franchise tag for Frank Clark at around $18 million would take up about a third of that, and the Seahawks have other in-house free agents they'll try to re-sign such as K.J. Wright, J.R. Sweezy, D.J. Fluker, Justin Coleman and Mychal Kendricks. Look for Schneider to again scour free agency for bargain buys at linebacker, safety, wide receiver, backup quarterback and kicker. -- Brady Henderson

Armed with just over $40 million in cap space, expect the Titans to sign impact players at the right price. They'll be active in the second wave of free agency once the market is set with the flurry of moves, especially at defensive end/outside linebacker. The safety position will be one to watch with Kenny Vaccaro becoming a free agent, Kevin Byard as a prime candidate for a lucrative extension and Johnathan Cyprien as a possible cap casualty. After hovering slightly above .500 (9-7) the past two seasons, the team has to make the necessary moves to ascend to the next level. But this year's free-agent group lacks a player that can single-handedly elevate the Titans to Super Bowl contender. -- Turron Davenport

They'll be kind of active because they have gaps to fill, but it won't be about high-priced players and will mostly be about seeking a few good bargains. That has been their M.O. under president Bruce Allen. Washington does have around $17 million under the cap right now and will release some players to free up more space. They will sign a veteran quarterback, although it might be a low-cost one such as Josh Johnson. They could sign an inexpensive veteran left guard and get more help at inside linebacker. They could use help at safety. And the team won't find all its answers in the draft. But the Redskins now are keen on adding compensatory picks, so they will have to sign some bargain players but likely allow their high-priced guys to leave (such as LB Preston Smith). -- John Keim

The Falcons, with about $24 million in cap space, seem unlikely to be big players in free agency with the possibility of defensive tackle Grady Jarrett eating up $15.3 million in cap space under the franchise tag. Now, the Falcons could reach an extension deal with Jarrett and significantly lower that 2019 cap number, but that won't necessarily lead to a spending spree. Signing Jarrett, however, could free up room for some activity such as re-signing pass-rusher Bruce Irvin. -- Vaughn McClure

The Panthers have slightly more than $15 million in cap space after re-signing safety Eric Reid, so they won't be very active unless they clear more space. That would happen if the team opts to move on from left tackle Matt Kalil. The focus likely will be on finding a midrange-priced edge rusher with the retirement of end Julius Peppers or an offensive lineman who can play multiple positions. -- David Newton

The Bears rank near the bottom of the league in cap space but managed to free up almost $6 million by releasing tight end Dion Sims and $3 million by restructuring Kyle Long's contract. Still, don't expect the Bears to be all that aggressive in free agency after making their big move in September by trading for and extending Khalil Mack (with $11.3 million counting on the cap for 2019). But the Bears do have more leverage this offseason, thanks to a 12-4 season, making Chicago a much more attractive destination for free agents. -- John Roberts

It's hard to say exactly how active the Bengals will be with an entirely new coaching staff, but their general strategy in the past has been to build through the draft. The Bengals did try to go after safety Kurt Coleman last year, showing they might be budging a little on that. However, they have several of their own players to re-sign, so their top focus will likely be doing that rather than going after other free agents. -- Katherine Terrell

The Cowboys' priority is to re-sign their own, like DeMarcus Lawrence, Amari Cooper, Dak Prescott and potentially Ezekiel Elliott and Byron Jones, which will chew up a lot of their cap space, time and effort. Executive vice president Stephen Jones does not believe going big in free agency is a smart play, but the Cowboys will look to make smart -- if not splashy -- signings. But remember, the Cowboys made an offer to Sammy Watkins last year worth $16 million per year only to see him sign with the Chiefs. If the Cowboys see an opportunity, they will not be afraid to take it. Someone like Earl Thomas could be a potential target, provided the price is right. -- Todd Archer

The Dolphins have been transparent, noting their desire to rebuild and avoid signing short-term fixes like they have in recent years. This offseason will be spent getting their salary cap in order and likely ridding themselves of high-priced veterans like quarterback Ryan Tannehill and defensive end Andre Branch rather than adding them to the roster. Expect Miami to target the second wave of free agency to bolster the roster, but fans hopeful for a big-name splash signing will likely be disappointed. -- Cameron Wolfe

We asked NFL Nation reporters to make their best offer for the free-agent running back -- then chose the best one. Green Bay, Houston or New York? Story
• Bowen: There are better all-purpose backs
This is the safest prediction for a team that ranks in the bottom five of available cap space. The Vikings knew they would be restricting their capabilities in free agency for 2019 and 2020 when they signed quarterback Kirk Cousins, who accounts for 15.5 percent of the cap. If Minnesota wants to go after an offensive lineman in free agency, franchise Anthony Barr, pay Sheldon Richardson or even consider offering Adam Thielen a new deal this offseason, it will have to get creative with how it goes about moving money around. That means looking to restructure a handful of contracts or releasing players who could free up a chunk of cap space (i.e., Everson Griffen, Andrew Sendejo, Mike Remmers). The Vikings have to be financially choosy with the needs they address in free agency. The rest will have to come in the draft. -- Courtney Cronin

General manager Kevin Colbert said last week not to expect the Steelers to make a big splash in free agency -- that has never been their philosophy. With almost $18 million in cap space ahead of the likely trade of Antonio Brown, the Steelers will look for affordable help on defense or receiver and have several of their own free agents to focus on, including guard Ramon Foster and linebacker Ryan Shazier, who won't play in 2019 but is still expected to be signed. And then there is the new deal the team is working on for quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who is entering the final year of his contract. This doesn't add up to the Steelers being big players in free agency later this month. -- John Roberts
The Bucs currently have just $19 million in cap space with an unsigned left tackle in Donovan Smith, who will be arguably their biggest priority (keep in mind that they will need $9 million for their rookie pool). It might also mean parting ways with Kwon Alexander and Adam Humphries. They'll try to maneuver some cap space around, offering players more guaranteed money upfront and making some cuts, but this isn't looking like a blockbuster year unless they can move some money. -- Jenna Laine

26256062,"Brown, who turns 31 on July 10, also referred to Raiders coach Jon Gruden as a father figure of sorts.
""Mr. Gruden played everything in my decision coming here,"" Brown said at the team facility. ""Obviously, he's an offensive guru. You get excited just talking with him. He's got so much knowledge of the game. He's coached some of the greatest players ever, so he knows what it takes.
The Oakland Raiders have announced that they've signed former Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Tyrell Williams.
In a flurry of weekend decisions, the Raiders brought back Hankins, a solid, if unspectacular starter, and Harris, a key backup.
""He did his homework on me. He done seen every play I've played in. ... He doesn't want to talk about what you're doing well; he always wants to focus on the things that you can even do that much more better. When you have a coach like that, it's like your dad -- you want to be around because you know he's not going to build you up for what you're doing [well], he's going to encourage you on how you always can be better.""
It was a decidedly kinder, gentler Brown than Pittsburgh Steelers fans saw toward the end of last season and early this offseason, when his nine-season tenure that included seven Pro Bowls and four first-team All-Pro selections came to an end.
Gone was the gold-dyed mustache; he said he wanted to be more ""professional."" There were no histrionics in his arrival -- no helicopter landing or Facebook Live stream -- even if the news conference did start about 25 minutes late.
Brown and his family, with agent Drew Rosenhaus, walked into the team auditorium with Gruden and new Raiders general manager Mike Mayock a few minutes after the trade was made official in a news release -- Brown to the Raiders for Oakland's third- and fifth-round draft picks this year, Nos. 66 and 141 overall -- announcing the deal that was struck Saturday night.
Mayock said the Raiders did not get involved with Brown until Friday night, after his proposed trade to the Buffalo Bills fell apart earlier in the day.
""He is as good of a practice football player and works as hard as any football player I have ever seen in my life,"" Mayock said of Brown.
And this from Gruden: ""We don't want to have a good receiving corps; I want to have the best receiving corps in football. And I think to have the best, you've got to have the best; and in my opinion, we acquired the best wide receiver in football. And let's get to work.
""He's done everything in his power to be the best he can possibly be, on and off the field. His body of work is not only impressive, it's fun to watch. He's electrifying after the catch, he's a great competitor, he wins the 50/50 ball, he's outstanding in short areas. You have a great imagination as a football coach when you coach a man like this. He can play split end, he can play flank or he can play in the slot. He can return punts and sell popcorn at halftime. We're excited about this guy.""
Gruden said he and Mayock, along with their wives, Cindy and Mandy, were in Las Vegas on Friday night to attend an event with Raiders owner Mark Davis.
""Instead of having a nice date, a double date, we dated Rosenhaus and Antonio Brown,"" Gruden said with a laugh. ""Never saw our wives, but it's as happy as Cindy and Mandy have been since we've known them.""
Gruden and Mayock are just as thrilled with Brown reinvigorating the Raiders' offense (Oakland also agreed to terms with former Chargers receiver Tyrell Williams on Wednesday). Brown and Rosenhaus renegotiated the three years remaining on his contract so that they are worth $50.125 million, with incentives that can increase the value to $54.125 million, and $30.125 million guaranteed.
Brown has averaged 114 catches for 1,524 yards the past six seasons. No Raiders receiver in franchise history has ever reached either of those marks in a single season.
Since 2014, Brown's 576 receptions are 52 more than any other player in the NFL. His 59 receiving touchdowns are 14 more than anyone else, and his 2,204 receiving yards and 21 TDs in the fourth quarter are both NFL highs.
Jordy Nelson led Oakland's receivers with 63 catches for 739 yards and three touchdowns last season.
""My plan is to get around here, get in the room, start holding guys accountable, let them know it's a certain type of standard here now that we got to uphold,"" Brown said. ""Receivers, we need an accountability system -- drops, [being] late, fines, missed routes, missed sights. We're going to hold each other accountable; and if you don't fall in that accountability, you get fined.
""And so when [quarterback] Derek Carr walks in the room, he sees all the receivers -- this guy owes this, this guy owes this -- so everyone has that accountability factor. Because if everyone's held accountable, we've got to be at a certain standard. So I'm just here to set certain standards, hold guys accountable and just uplift the tradition of -- it's unacceptable to accept not our best. That's kind of my attitude. We're still shaping the team. I can't do it all in one day, but just as a first start, to kick off me being here and us doing some positive things moving forward.""
Brown is also in a unique situation in that he will play one season in Oakland, so long as the Coliseum Commission votes to approve the lease on Friday, before moving to Las Vegas in 2020.
""For me to be in Oakland, part of the Oakland Raiders, and being on the last team that will ever be here in Oakland is something special in itself,"" he said. ""There's pressure in that, there's excitement in that and there's a lot that comes with that. And I'm here today ready to embrace all that.""
Asked if he had any regrets on how he handled things at the end in Pittsburgh, Brown focused on young fans.
""To any kid out there from Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh will always be my family,"" Brown said. ""Those guys gave me a chance when I was a 21-year-old kid. Obviously, people are listening to the things that are being said and written. At the end of the day, it's all about how you make people feel. I think I made people feel good and great, really inspired, the way they watched me work, the way they watched me play. I know Steeler Nation is having a bad day today, but it's always love. I encourage every kid who watched me work and was inspired by everything I've done. I hope I continue to be a good example, continue to be a good role model and continue to inspire people.""
And for his personal end game, Brown sits at No. 28 on the NFL's all-time receptions list with 837 catches. Sure, only three active players have more catches -- Larry Fitzgerald (1,303), Brandon Marshall (970) and Antonio Gates (955). But Brown is still 712 away from Rice -- who also played one season for Gruden -- and his 1,549 receptions
""My goal really is to catch Jerry Rice,"" Brown said. ""Playing with a guy like Coach Gruden, obviously, he knows what it takes to keep me upright and fresh. Keep me out there for a long time so it's a challenge every year to prove my love for the game. I'm just taking it one year at a time.
""Obviously, my goal in the back of my mind is to catch Jerry Rice. Every year, I have to prove my love. This year I'm out here to prove my love.""

26267596,"Poole is the leading candidate to replace Buster Skrine as the Jets' nickel corner. After four seasons in that role, Skrine signed a free-agent contract with the Chicago Bears. The Jets didn't try to retain him. They also have no plans to re-sign starter Morris Claiborne.
For now, the Jets' top three corners are Trumaine Johnson, Darryl Roberts and Poole. On Thursday, Roberts re-signed for three years, $18 million.
Poole, whom the Atlanta Falcons wanted to bring back but not at the price of a low-level restricted free-agent tender, started 21 of 47 games, including nine last season, since entering the league as an undrafted free agent in 2016.
The team's primary nickel back during his three seasons in Atlanta, Poole, 26, had three interceptions, two fumble recoveries, three sacks and 75 tackles last season, when he made $630,000.
He also contributed on special teams, making three tackles in 2018.

26031020,"The deal is worth up to $3.25 million and includes a $350,000 signing bonus, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Welcome to AZ, @C42Clay!https://t.co/tesoxgMvp1
Clay, 30, was scheduled to count $9 million against the Bills' salary cap in the final season of a five-year, $38 million contract. He finished last season with a career-low 184 receiving yards while averaging a career-low 8.8 yards per catch.
Despite playing in 13 games and making 12 starts, his 21 catches were his fewest since 2012.
The signing continues to bolster the Cardinals' depth -- the team already has added former Atlanta Falcons cornerback Robert Alford and defensive end Brooks Reed -- as general manager Steve Keim and new coach Kliff Kingsbury head into free agency and the NFL draft.

Kingsbury is familiar with with Clay's play from college, and he sees an important role for him in Arizona's potentially dynamic offense, a source told Schefter.
Bills general manager Doug Whaley made signing the transition-tagged Clay away from the division-rival Miami Dolphins one of his signature moves of the 2015 offseason. The Bills guaranteed $24.5 million of Clay's deal, but his production in Buffalo never matched what remain his two best seasons -- for Miami in 2013 and 2014.
Clay's most recent touchdown came in Week 3 of the 2017 season. He surpassed 30 receiving yards in only two games during the 2018 season and was made a healthy scratch for a Week 16 contest at New England.
In eight NFL seasons, Clay has caught 339 passes for 3,631 yards and 23 touchdowns. He also rushed for a score in 2013.

26265214,"Fluker's deal reportedly is for two years while Iupati's is for one year.
Iupati, who has played left guard exclusively throughout his eight-year NFL career, becomes the favorite to start at that position. The former Cardinal replaces J.R. Sweezy, who signed with Arizona, in what amounts to a swap of left guards between the NFC West rivals.
Free-agent linebacker K.J. Wright has decided to remain with the Seahawks.
""They're a winning team,"" Iupati said in the team release. ""They've been competitors and contenders for the nine years I've been in the league. It's close to home, and Mike Solari is also one of the biggest reasons I wanted to come here because he was my coach in San Fran. He's awesome.""
Fluker, who made nine starts at right guard last season, was one of Seattle's 14 unrestricted free agents. Pete Carroll made multiple mentions of how the Seahawks wanted to re-sign Fluker, noting how well his attitude and physicality fit with their style of play.
Keeping Fluker means Sweezy is the only starting offensive lineman the Seahawks will not return from last season.
NFL Network first reported both deals.
""#UnfinishedBusiness"" was among the hashtags Fluker included in a picture that he tweeted after news broke of his deal to remain in Seattle.
#UnfinishedBusiness #12s #DJTheWarrior #Seahawks #Seattle #NFL @Seahawks @NFL @espn pic.twitter.com/mebdGzWCph
Iupati's time with the Cardinals was defined by injuries, as the 31-year-old veteran didn't play a full 16-game schedule in any of his four seasons with the team.
He was limited to 10 games in 2018 while dealing with back and knee injuries. That followed a 2017 season in which Iupati missed the rest of the season after suffering a triceps injury in Week 1. He also missed one game in 2016 and three games in 2015, his first with the Cardinals.
When healthy, Iupati was consistent, starting all 39 games that he played after joining the Cardinals on a five-year deal worth $40 million in 2015, when he was widely considered the best offensive lineman on the free-agent market.
The former first-round pick of the San Francisco 49ers (17th overall) in 2010 took a $3 million pay cut before the 2018 season, which also voided the 2019 year on his deal.

26274661,"Thomas had been linked to the Kansas City Chiefs, Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers at the start of free agency, but the Ravens started negotiations with Thomas on Wednesday and quickly signed the Seattle Seahawks free agent to a four-year, $55 million deal that includes $32 million guaranteed.
""I thought I was going to Kansas City on a two-year deal, one-year deal,"" Thomas said. ""I was just going to better myself, hit the market again.""
He said he then received a call from his agents.
""They said Baltimore has a mega deal for you,"" he said. ""And I said 'hell, yeah.""
""It was last minute,"" Thomas added at Friday's introductory press conference. ""I didn't expect the Ravens to even give me a chance. I didn't hear about the Ravens throughout the whole process. I actually thought I was going somewhere else. I'm very appreciative for the opportunity.""
The Ravens wanted to keep C.J. Mosley, but they were priced out when he agreed to a five-year, $85 million contract with the New York Jets on Tuesday. One day later, Baltimore turned its attention to Thomas, who was surprisingly still available.
Thomas fills the void left by Eric Weddle, who was recently cut by the Ravens, and provides leadership to a defense that lost three other key members in the first two days of free agency.
""We swooped in,"" Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said. ""We have a good relationship with agents. We saw an opportunity and we made a move. And I think it was a great move. I'm extremely happy with what we were able to do very quickly, putting a deal together and getting a deal that made sense for the player and for the team. That's how you have to do it in today's modern salary-cap age. You have to stay flexible and be aggressive.""
One of the questions with Thomas is durability. After not missing a start from 2010 to 2015, he has been sidelined for 19 games over the past three seasons.
His left leg has been broken twice (in 2016 and 2018), and he is coming off a career-low four games last season.
""I don't think they're a factor at all,"" Thomas said about his injuries. ""Experience is the best teacher. I've been through this process before with this injury. I came back and went to the Pro Bowl and had an All-Pro year. I expect to do the same thing this year.""
Thomas, 29, has already starting making himself at home. He worked a deal to get the No. 29 jersey, which had been worn by cornerback Marlon Humphrey.
""His mom has a track team,"" Thomas said. ""So I might throw a little bread that way.""
Running back Mark Ingram was introduced with Thomas at Friday's press conference. While Thomas preferred not to talk about his nine years in Seattle, Ingram spoke about how tough it was for him to leave New Orleans after eight seasons.
Ravens officials believe both will become leading voices on both sides of the ball for Baltimore.
""Both men really do define what we look for in football players,"" DeCosta said. ""Humility, leadership, toughness and intelligence. Both guys really fit our culture with the style they play with. They'll be fan favorites very quickly.""

26086809,"INDIANAPOLIS -- For all but the last four games of the 2018 season, Aaron Rodgers' entire tenure as the Green Bay Packers' starting quarterback has been under one head coach, Mike McCarthy.
After four games under interim coach Joe Philbin, Rodgers will begin this coming season with Matt LaFleur as his new coach.
How Rodgers reacts to the first-time head coach could dictate his level of success.
""He has to embrace it,"" Packers president Mark Murphy told ESPN on Tuesday at the NFL combine. ""And I think he is. I hope he adapts well. I'm excited. I know he's excited. I've had some discussions with him.""
Rodgers has not spoken publicly since Murphy hired LaFleur, the former Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator, on Jan. 7. Rodgers also hasn't met in person with his new coach, either. But they've had several conversations, according to Murphy, since their initial phone call on the day LaFleur was offered the job.
We asked NFL Nation reporters to make their best offers for the free-agent running back -- then chose the best one. Green Bay, Houston or New York?
Rodgers' relationship with McCarthy became a point of speculation last season, when McCarthy was fired with four games left in his 13th season as head coach. Their partnership appeared to sour for good when Rodgers bashed the Packers' offense after their 22-0 win over the Bills in late September.
The day after McCarthy was fired in December, Rodgers was asked if he thought he had anything to do with McCarthy's dismissal and said: ""I hope that's not the reason.""
LaFleur parted ways with most of McCarthy's offensive staff but brought back a former McCarthy assistant, Luke Getsy, to coach quarterbacks. Getsy spent last season as Mississippi State's offensive coordinator after spending the previous four years with the Packers. While LaFleur will call the offensive plays, he said Getsy and offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett all will have a hand in coaching Rodgers.
""We've got three quarterback guys that are going to be hitting him from all angles,"" LaFleur said last week. ""I'm going to do part. I know that I need to be in that room, especially as much as I possibly can because I am going to be the playcaller. I think that relationship between the playcaller and the quarterback is absolutely critical. So I will be in there as much as I can. I don't foresee ever missing a quarterback meeting.""
Murphy acknowledged that Rodgers needs to buy in to LaFleur's coaching and the changes he plans to implement on offense, especially because at age 35, Rodgers' window to win another Super Bowl might be starting to close.
""He's driven,"" Murphy said. ""He wants to win championships, and I think he knows that he's got only so many years left. I'm excited. I think he and Matt, I think that relationship is going to be crucial. He's the head coach, but he's the playcaller.""
When asked specifically what Rodgers is excited about, Murphy said: ""I think the change. And I think he knows Matt's background and the work he's done with quarterbacks. Change is hard, but it's good. And I think he's excited about the change.""
Still, recent Packers history suggests the change may not pay immediate dividends. McCarthy didn't make the playoffs in his first season in 2006, but he took the Packers to the NFC title game in Year 2 and won the Super Bowl in Year 5 (Rodgers' third year as the starter). Mike Sherman missed the playoffs in his first season (2000) and Ray Rhodes missed in his only season (1992). Even Mike Holmgren failed to make the playoffs in his first year (1992).
However, Murphy pointed to the success that first-year Bears coach Matt Nagy had last season, leading Chicago to the NFC North title.
""There's no question, with as much change as we have, there's going to be an adjustment, but I'm optimistic,"" Murphy said. ""I think we'll see improvement.""

26267076,"Bridgewater, 26, agreed to a one-year $7.25 million deal that is worth up to $12.5 million with incentives, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Bridgewater, who is from Miami, met with the Dolphins at their team facility on Wednesday. But he ultimately decided to stay put in New Orleans, where he spent last season after the Saints traded a third-round pick to acquire him and a sixth-rounder from the New York Jets.
Bridgewater's agreement comes on the 13-year anniversary of Brees signing his original deal in New Orleans. Brees' choice also came down to the Saints and Dolphins -- the irony of which was not lost on Bridgewater as he tweeted about his decision.
13 years later, I'm trying to see if history will repeat itself in my favor at some point.
""Run it back Turbo.."" pic.twitter.com/NsvF1x00KG
Like Brees, Bridgewater is also hoping for a renaissance in the second chapter of his career after suffering a major injury early in his career.
And Bridgewater is apparently willing to wait to find the perfect long-term fit, even though he has started just one game over the past three seasons.
Bridgewater began his career as the 32nd pick in the draft with the Minnesota Vikings in 2014 -- and he led them to the playoffs with an 11-5 record in 2015. But then he suffered a devastating knee injury in the summer of 2016, tearing his ACL among other ligaments and structural damage.
It remains to be seen how much longer the 40-year-old Brees plans to continue playing -- and how the long Saints plan to keep paying both QBs. But for now they wanted to keep their long-term options open with Bridgewater after being impressed by their brief time together.
Bridgewater signed a one-year, incentive-laden deal with the Jets as a free agent last March, and he impressed during the preseason. But he became expendable after they decided to go with rookie Sam Darnold as their starter.
Bridgewater then made his first start in nearly three years when the Saints rested Brees among other starters in Week 17. Although Bridgewater threw for just 118 yards with one touchdown and one interception in a loss to the Carolina Panthers, he continued to show teams that he was healthy again.
The 6-foot-2, 215-pounder went 6-6 as a rookie starter and 11-5 in 2015 before a playoff loss to Seattle. He threw for a total of 6,150 yards, 28 touchdowns and 21 interceptions in those two seasons.
The Saints carved out enough cap space to sign Bridgewater and newly-signed defensive tackle Malcom Brown by restructuring Brees' deal -- shifting $10.8 million in salary-cap costs from 2019 to 2020.

26030855,"PITTSBURGH -- The Antonio Brown trade saga is getting much-needed clarity after the All-Pro receiver met with Pittsburgh Steelers president Art Rooney II on Tuesday.
Brown tweeted that both sides ""agreed that it is time to move on.""
Had a great meeting with Mr.Rooney today we discussed a lot of things and we cleared the air on several issues! We both agreed  that it is time to move on but I'll always have appreciation and gratitude towards the  Rooney family and @steelers organization! #CallGod #Boomin pic.twitter.com/DEgURchvhW
Brown's agent Drew Rosenhaus joined the meeting, as did Steelers GM Kevin Colbert and executive Omar Khan, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The meeting was cordial and ""everyone agreed the trade will be for the best,"" a source told Schefter.
Rooney told reporters last month that he wanted to hear directly from Brown on what went wrong.
Brown, who first requested a trade in late January, tweeted it was a ""great meeting"" and that he and Rooney ""cleared the air on several issues.""
Steelers All-Pro wide receiver Antonio Brown took questions from fans on Twitter on Saturday, addressing his recent trade request and his relationship with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.
Rosenhaus told ESPN's NFL Live that he doesn't have permission to talk to other teams or work on a trade and that the ""whole trade effort"" is being run by the Steelers.
""They have the ability to talk to other teams right now and find the best deal for them,"" Rosenhaus told ESPN. ""We hope they get a great amount of compensation. We want everybody to win here. it would be great for the Steelers to get what they deem fair compensation for Antonio, and for Antonio to find a new team at this point. And we reap all the positives from that. So that is where it is.""
The tweet followed an Instagram video posted by Brown, who said he's not playing without more guaranteed money and reinforced his desire to be traded by the Steelers.
""If your squad out there want to win and your squad want a hungry wide receiver who's the best in the whole world, someone hit my phone,"" Brown said into his phone camera while working on an elliptical. ""Tell them I ain't doing no unguarantees. I ain't even gonna play myself no more for this NFL, you heard.""
Brown has no more true guarantees left on his current deal. The five-year, $72.7 million extension he signed in 2017 includes base salaries of $12.625 million, $11.3 million and $12.5 million. Those relatively modest numbers are considered a selling point in a trade. Brown is due a $2.5 million roster bonus on March 17, but the Steelers could avoid payment by trading or releasing him before that date.
NFL contracts can be reworked, so Brown can ask a new team to convert salaried money into guarantees -- a strategy the Steelers used twice with Brown in the past, converting future money into a signing bonus. But teams hold the power since he's under contract. Brown's only true leverage is threatening to hold out.
Rosenhaus told ESPN that ""Antonio was clear about what he's looking for"" and this is ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for another football team.""
Brown turns 31 in July, and the Steelers are making receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster a focal point of the offense. The team would take on $21.12 million in dead money by releasing or trading Brown but would offset that money by saving on his $22.165 million salary-cap figure for 2019.
Brown, who said he'd like to be known as ""Mr. Big Chest"" from now on, remains unfazed.
""I think I done done everything. What y'all think? What's left for me to do?"" Brown said. ""Win a Super Bowl? Hey, gotta be the right team for that, right? Who wants smoke? I've got a lot of fuel built up. When this fuel turns to smoke, hope you're in shape, hope you're ready to go the distance. I'm telling you, I'm ready to go 36 rounds, like a heavyweight, ya heard. ...
""If your team got guaranteed money, tell them call me. AB can't do no more unguarantees. So we clear. I want ya'll to be clear and understand something. This is not a game, people. This is not for show; this is not to be cool. This is strictly to inspire you that no one can determine your destination but you.""
Sources have maintained that the Steelers will be patient with any deal and will want a high draft pick in return for Brown, who holds an NFL-record six consecutive 100-catch seasons.
Brown has been doing his best to put public pressure on the Steelers, thanking fans for nine years with the team and fielding questions on Twitter. In a question-and-answer session Saturday, Brown said Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has an ""owner mentality"" for calling out players and coaches without repercussion and that coach Mike Tomlin told the team that Brown quit in Week 17 while he was hurt.

26144507,"Barron, who had two seasons remaining on his contract, was sidelined four games to start the 2018 season because of a nagging ankle injury. He finished with 43 tackles, a sack and a forced fumble.
The Rams save $6.33 million on their salary cap with the move and will carry a dead-money charge of $3.33 million. If they designate Barron for a post-June 1 release, they will save $8 million on their salary cap.
The Rams declined to exercise the 2019 option on starting center John Sullivan's contract, making him a free agent, sources told ESPN's Lindsey Thiry.
The Rams don't have a solid pass-rushing solution opposite Samson Ebukam and will look hard at re-signing Dante Fowler.
Barron, 29, was scheduled to be paid a base salary of $5 million in 2019.
The news of Barron's release follows the Rams' decision to decline the option on center John Sullivan's two-year contract, which saves the team $5.5 million on the salary cap.
But Barron's release leaves a notable hole in their linebacking corps as they attempt to build a roster worthy of a return trip to the Super Bowl.
Cory Littleton, who led the team with 90 tackles while adding four sacks and three interceptions, is expected to return. But backups Ramik Wilson, who started four games last season in Barron's absence, and Bryce Hager are unrestricted free agents. Micah Kiser, a fifth-round pick from Virginia in 2018, played a significant role on special teams, but he had only four tackles on defense.
The Rams acquired Barron midway through the 2014 season from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who selected him with the seventh overall pick in the 2012 draft.
A seven-year veteran, Barron has 628 career tackles, 9 sacks, 6 forced fumbles, 3 fumble recoveries and 8 interceptions.
The Rams moved Barron from safety to linebacker during the 2015 season and he finished with 113 tackles, 5 pass deflections and 3 forced fumbles.
Following that season, the Rams awarded him with a five-year deal worth up to $45 million.
Barron finished 2016 ranked second on the team with 118 tackles, two interceptions and a sack as the Rams stumbled to a 4-12 finish.
Over the last two seasons, Barron has been slowed because of various injuries but also played an instrumental role in helping the team win back-to-back division titles and earn its first Super Bowl appearance since the 2001 season.
In 2017, Barron dealt with a host of nagging injuries and was ultimately sidelined for the final three games of the regular season with a sore Achilles before he returned for a playoff loss in the wild-card round.
Last season, Barron was slowed and sidelined throughout training camp and sat out the first four games of the season because of a sore ankle. His 43 tackles were the fewest of his career.

26121288,"Garrett enters 2019 on the final year of a five-year, $30 million deal he signed in 2015. That contract came after the first time he was coaching for his future and directed the Cowboys to a 12-4 record and a spot in the playoffs.
If Jones loves Garrett so much, why wouldn't he give the coach a longer deal?
""Well, I just like the dynamics considering the relationship we have, the trust we have, our goals,"" Jones said during a wide-ranging, 50-minute interview on the team's luxury bus from the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis. ""I do my best work without a net. I really do. I'm better with a little risk involved, and so in essence there's a little bit of no net here. And the real question is why not?
""He's not in danger of having any issue with his credibility with the players or anybody else. It's well-known the support I have for him. And no one -- no one breathing -- wants him to win and win big more than I do. We haven't done anything here with what we have done or haven't done relative to contract. We haven't done anything to forego having a long relationship. We haven't done one thing by taking our position we have right now, in my mind. And we've got the kind of situation that I think our fans want.""
The Cowboys head coach says ""backs-to-the-wall mentality has served us well through the years.""
Tom Landry coached the Cowboys for 29 years, winning 250 games and two Super Bowls. Entering his ninth full season, Garrett is the second-longest-tenured Cowboys coach. He has not gotten the Cowboys past the divisional round in three playoff trips, but Jones continues to admire his work.
""He's never lost a team. Ever. Under any circumstances, even when we've had some real dark days to look at looking ahead, he's never lost a team in terms of their belief in him and in terms of their will to work for him as far as a head coach,"" Jones said. ""That's impressive, very impressive. I've seen good works there. Hopefully that can come together, we get him a Super Bowl, he'll be maybe the longest-tenured coach in the history of the Cowboys.""
If the Cowboys win a Super Bowl, then it will be with Dak Prescott at quarterback.
Jones said the Cowboys are talking to Prescott's agent, Todd France, regarding a new deal, but he did not put a timetable on when one could get done. Like Garrett, Prescott is signed through 2019 and set to make $2.02 million this season.
""His contract is one that is squarely in the eye of the needle relative to that part of running a football team, getting his contract done,"" Jones said. ""And we've got several that are in that category, but we are in that activity, we're in that window, we're in that time when you do this. There's nothing notable here other than the fact that it's as substantive as it is. But there's nothing notable about where we are and where we aren't in our dialogue with him. It's business as usual. Nothing to flare over here.""
Jones is not scared of the potential price for a long-term deal, which could be more than $25 million annually.
""It's not uncommon for people or positions or your particular contribution to have a lot of money involved,"" Jones said. ""I understand it.""

26231282,"The Jacksonville Jaguars will sign former Eagles quarterback Nick Foles to a four-year deal worth $88 million, according to ESPN and multiple sources.
The deal includes $50.125 million in guaranteed money, a source tells ESPN's Adam Schefter.
The Jaguars are expected to release quarterback Blake Bortles once Foles officially signs, according to ESPN's Dan Graziano.
Nick Foles is a no-doubt upgrade at quarterback for the Jaguars, but given his supporting cast, they can't expect him to become elite.
DeSean Jackson is headed back to Philadelphia after the Eagles agreed to a trade with the Bucs, sources told ESPN's Dianna Russini, confirming earlier reports.
Former Jaguars defensive tackle Malik Jackson is expected to sign a three-year, $30 million contract with the Eagles, sources told ESPN.
The $50.125 million is the largest amount of guaranteed money in franchise history. Defensive tackle Malik Jackson, who was released last week, got $42 million guaranteed when he signed in 2016.
Foles was the Jaguars' top target and the contract shows they're clearly committed to him as their starter beyond 2020. It also likely takes quarterback off the board for Jacksonville in the first round of the draft, even if Dwayne Haskins were to slip to them at No. 7.
For Foles, the primary objective of this offseason was to find a team he could call his own following two incredible seasons as the backup to Carson Wentz with the Philadelphia Eagles.
Foles, 30, opted out of his contract with the Eagles by paying them back $2 million in February.
""I would love to lead a team,"" the MVP of Super Bowl LII said at the close of the 2018 season. ""The starter thing, leading a team, impacting a locker room ... that's why we play the game, to impact people, to create an atmosphere.""

Originally drafted by the Eagles in the third round in 2012, Foles was traded to the St. Louis Rams before the 2015 season after a few up-and-down years in Philly. He contemplated retirement following a difficult year in St. Louis, but instead rejoined coach Andy Reid as a backup with the Kansas City Chiefs before returning to Philly in a similar role in 2017.
A signing that received little attention at the time proved to be one of the most important in Eagles franchise history, as Foles took over for Wentz down the stretch that season and helped the team to its first Super Bowl title. He completed 73 percent of his passes -- an NFL single-season record -- and threw six touchdowns with one interception during that playoff run en route to being named Super Bowl MVP.
He proved it was no fluke by again saving the Eagles' season in 2018, helping them to three straight wins in place of an injured Wentz to close the regular season and a road victory over the Chicago Bears in the wild-card round of the playoffs.
Foles has completed 62 percent of his passes in 54 career games, with 68 touchdowns to 33 interceptions. He has the sixth-best career postseason passer rating (98.8) in NFL history.
The years and value of Foles' deal with Jacksonville were first reported Monday by the NFL Network.

26275558,"An investigation is underway into an alleged battery involving a juvenile at the home of Kansas City Chiefs star wide receiver Tyreek Hill.
In a statement Friday, the Chiefs acknowledged an investigation involving Hill is taking place.
""The club is aware of the investigation involving Tyreek Hill,"" the Chiefs said. ""We're in the process of gathering information and have been in contact with the league and local authorities. We'll have no further comment at this time.""
Overland Park police officer John Lacy said the case has been turned over to prosecutors for review. No charges have been filed against Hill, and Johnson County prosecutor's spokeswoman Kristi Bergeron didn't immediately return a phone message seeking comment.
According to a police report obtained by KCTV, police in Overland Park, Kansas, were called to Hill's home Thursday to investigate an alleged battery in which a juvenile was a victim and Hill's fiancée is listed as ""others involved."" Hill was not listed on the report.
Officers were previously called to Hill's address March 5 to investigate a report of child abuse or neglect. Hill's name was listed on that report. According to Overland Park police, the case was closed three days later when prosecution was declined.
The Kansas Department of Children and Families also told the Kansas City Star that it is investigating the most recent incident.
""I can only confirm we received a report and an investigation is ongoing,"" said Mike Deines, spokesperson for DCF, told the Star.
While at Oklahoma State, Hill was convicted of domestic assault for an incident in which he was accused of punching and choking his girlfriend. He was given three years of probation and ordered to undergo anger management classes.

How have others fared in similar situations? The list is relatively small, especially when you eliminate those whose ""retirements"" lasted less than one offseason. (Ahem, Brett Favre.) I also didn't consider players such as Michael Vick or Plaxico Burress, who returned to the field after time in jail. Here are six of the most notable efforts to return from retirement, ranked more or less in order of their success.
Note: This an updated version of a story that ran in April 2017.
Cunningham had the best season of his career after retiring (for the first time). His career appeared over in 1995 when, at age 32, he received almost no interest on the free-agent market. So Cunningham retired, moved home to Las Vegas and operated a granite and marble shop. But Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green convinced him to resume his career as a backup in 1997. When starter Brad Johnson was injured in 1998, Cunningham took over and led the team to an overall 15-1 record (13-1 in Cunningham's starts) with an MVP-caliber season, throwing for 3,704 yards and 34 touchdowns. He earned a contract extension worth up to $28 million but was benched after six starts in 1999. He finished his career as a backup for the Ravens in 2001.
Sanders fashioned an improbable second career as a part-time defensive back with the Baltimore Ravens -- after a full three seasons away from the game. He initially called it quits after the 2000 season; he was so eager to get away that he forfeited part of an $8 million signing bonus he had received from the Washington Redskins. In 2004, he signed with the Ravens and took the number 37 to match his age. In 25 games, including six starts, he intercepted five passes -- returning one for a touchdown -- and defended a total of 10 passes. But the Ravens missed the playoffs in both seasons and he retired for good in 2006.
Jason Witten, who retired after the 2017 season and served as an analyst for ESPN's Monday Night Football, is returning for a 16th season with the Cowboys, the team announced.
Williams played longer after his first retirement than he did before it, but he never replicated his early-career production. After rushing for a combined 4,470 yards from 2001 to 2003 for the New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins, he retired rather than endure a 2004 drug suspension. At age 27, Williams moved to India to study yoga and holistic medicine. He returned for 12 games in 2005, rushing for 743 yards and six touchdowns, but was suspended and moved to the CFL in 2006. A torn pectoral muscle limited him to one game for the Dolphins in 2007. Incredibly, he went on to play four 16-game seasons between 2008 and 2011; he managed only one 1,000-yard season among them before retiring permanently at age 34.
Simply put, Nagurski was one of the baddest men ever to play pro football. In 1943, at age 35 and after five years away from a game that battered his body, Nagurski came out of retirement to help the Chicago Bears during World War II. Although he was best known as a running back, Nagurski was 6-foot-2 and 235 pounds and also played defensive tackle during an era of two-way players. Bears owner George Halas needed his help on defense more than anything, but he sneaked Nagurski onto the field for offense a few times, too. Nagurski played in eight games, rushing for 84 yards, and he had a touchdown in the NFL championship game. The Bears won the title with a 41-21 victory over the Washington Redskins.
Lynch first retired in February 2016, famously tweeting an image of his cleats hanging from a power line. At age 29, ancient for running backs, Lynch had missed nine games for the Seattle Seahawks and by all appearances seemed ready to move on from the field. As it turned out, however, Lynch had one more goal to reach: playing for his hometown team in Oakland. After making his desires known in April 2017, Lynch convinced the Seahawks to trade his rights to the Raiders. In 21 games over two seasons since then, Lynch has rushed for 1,267 yards and 10 touchdowns.
I just love this story. In the summer of 1998, the Atlanta Falcons signed DeBerg to be their backup quarterback because they were concerned about depth behind starter Chris Chandler. DeBerg was 44 -- that's not a typo -- and had last been on an NFL roster in 1993. DeBerg was a friend of coach Dan Reeves and knew his offensive system, so not only did he make the team, but he also started one game and played in a total of eight as the Falcons marched to Super Bowl XXXIII. DeBerg had an 80.4 passer rating, completing 30-of-59 passes for 369 yards and three touchdowns. The only player in NFL history with more attempts at that age or older is Vinny Testaverde, who threw 172 at age 44 in 2007.

26111283,"Collins' car crashed into a tree in Owings Mills around 6:48 a.m., according to police. The charges against Collins are expected to be announced Friday afternoon.
Collins, 24, ranked 11th in the NFL in rushing in 2017 with 973 yards and drew national attention for his Irish dance moves. Last season, he struggled with a foot injury and a lack of explosiveness, losing the starting job to undrafted rookie Gus Edwards and spending the final five games on injured reserve.
There were no guarantees that Collins would return to the Ravens even before his arrest, as he was a restricted free agent whom the team might not have tendered.

26171890,"The fourth-year pro from Iowa was set to become a restricted free agent next week.
Kreiter became the first long snapper in franchise history to earn a Pro Bowl berth last season after he snapped 146 times (85 punts, 35 extra points, 25 field goals and a fake punt) without an unplayable delivery.
Kreiter has appeared in 42 games for the Broncos the last three seasons. An All-Big Ten Conference selection at Iowa, he joined the NFL as a college free agent with Dallas in 2014 and competed in the Cowboys' training camp in 2014-15 before signing with Denver in 2016.

26243237,"The Kansas City Chiefs have agreed to trade edge rusher Dee Ford to the San Francisco 49ers, a source confirmed to ESPN's Josina Anderson.
The Niners are expected to give Ford a multiyear deal in the range of five years and $87.5 million, the source said.
San Francisco will send a 2020 second-round pick to Kansas City, a source confirmed. The deal can't become official until the new league year begins Wednesday.
The Niners were one of the league's worst at rushing the passer. Ford can help, but the move could also mean more flexibility in the draft.
If the Chiefs have a plan to fix last season's subpar defense they haven't revealed it yet and just got rid of their two most productive players.
""I feel appreciated,"" Ford told Yahoo Sports. ""Me knowing they believe in me ... talking to the GM, talking to the owner, talking to the head coach ... they couldn't wait [for me to get there].""
The Chiefs had placed the franchise tag on Ford last week, with the intention of trying to trade him, as reported by ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Kansas City has hired Steve Spagnuolo as defensive coordinator and is changing its base defensive system from a 3-4 to a 4-3, which would have necessitated a position change for Ford and Justin Houston, who was released by Kansas City.
Last season, Ford finally became the player the Chiefs had envisioned when they drafted him out of Auburn in the first round in 2014. He started all 16 games for the first time in his career and had a career-high 13 sacks. Ford, who will turn 28 on March 19, also was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the first time.

Ford ended his best season with his least productive game. He had no sacks or tackles in the Chiefs' AFC Championship Game home loss to the New England Patriots. He also was penalized for lining up offside on a play that resulted in an interception in the final minute of the fourth quarter.
The interception could have allowed the Chiefs, who had a four-point lead at the time, to run out the clock. Instead, the Patriots continued their drive to a go-ahead touchdown and eventually won in overtime.
For the 49ers, adding a premium edge rusher -- or two -- has long been at the top of their offseason shopping list. During the 2018 season, coach Kyle Shanahan compared the importance of an edge rusher to the defense to that of a quarterback on offense. It's a sentiment that San Francisco general manager John Lynch shared at the NFL scouting combine last month.

""You have to have a guy who can close out games, close out halves,"" Lynch said then. ""When you have them, they can be a difference-maker. I think we're also looking for powerful players. ... They're going to be playing with a quick trigger and getting after it. But those are guys that can get to the quarterback and finish him.""
San Francisco has been searching for a player on the outside fitting that description since it parted ways with Aldon Smith in 2014. Last year, interior lineman DeForest Buckner became the first Niner to reach double-digit sacks since Smith in 2012, but Shanahan and Lynch have been searching for the outside complement to help a team that has lost 11 one-possession games over the past two seasons turn that tide.
The 49ers finished 2018 tied for 22nd in the NFL in sacks with 37, but aside from Buckner, they did not have another player with more than 5.5 sacks.
San Francisco also holds the No. 2 overall pick in this year's draft, which could still allow the 49ers to find a pass-rushing tag-team partner for Ford.

In a span of several hours overnight, the Jets reshaped their linebacker corps for new defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, adding Mosley and Anthony Barr, who have eight Pro Bowl appearances between them. The total cost will be approximately $32 million per year.
The Jets envision Mosley, 26, as an inside linebacker in their 3-4 scheme and the leader of the front seven. They now have five starting-caliber linebackers, with Mosley, Avery Williamson and Darron Lee inside and Barr and Jordan Jenkins outside. Williamson's $6 million salary is fully guaranteed, so he likely will remain as Mosley's inside partner.
The Jets have landed former Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr, who intends to sign with New York when the free-agency period opens, a league source said.
Mosley was the leading tackler for the NFL's top-ranked defense and was the Baltimore Ravens' most high-profile free agent this offseason. He is one of two players, along with Carolina's Luke Kuechly, to record at least 500 tackles, eight sacks and eight interceptions since 2014.
A first-round pick (17th overall) in 2014, Mosley has gone to the Pro Bowl in four of his five NFL seasons, which puts him in select company. Seven of the 11 linebackers who were named to Pro Bowls at least four times in five seasons are in the Hall of Fame. Last year, Hall of Famer Ray Lewis called Mosley the best middle linebacker in the game.
This marks the first time in the Ravens' 23-year history that they have failed to keep a multiple Pro Bowl first-round pick past his rookie deal. Offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden, Lewis, outside linebacker Peter Boulware, cornerback Chris McAlister, tight end Todd Heap, safety Ed Reed, outside linebacker Terrell Suggs and defensive tackle Haloti Ngata all signed second contracts with Baltimore.
In a span of a week, the NFL's top-ranked defense has now lost its two signal-callers, Mosley and safety Eric Weddle; its most tenured player, Suggs; and linebacker Za'Darius Smith. Mosley, Weddle and Suggs have combined for 460 NFL starts and 17 Pro Bowls.

The biggest knock on Mosley has been his pass coverage, but his interception of Baker Mayfield in the final regular-season game clinched Baltimore's first playoff berth in four years. Mosley also posted career lows in passing yards allowed (408), yards per reception (9.3) and yards after the catch (190), according to Pro Football Focus.
The Ravens and Mosley both expressed optimism he would remain with the team. Baltimore, however, chose not to use a $15 million franchise tag, allowing Mosley to become a free agent.
With Mosley gone, the Ravens could replace him with Kenny Young, a fourth-round pick from a year ago, or a veteran free agent.
Mosley's 574 career tackles rank fifth in Ravens history.
Lee, a former first-round pick, faces an uncertain future. He hasn't met expectations over three years and finished last season with a four-game, substance abuse suspension. He counts only $3.3 million on the cap in the final year of his rookie contract, so he could be traded or released. His $1.8 million salary no longer is guaranteed because the guarantee was voided by the suspension.
One source cautioned that Lee could remain on the Jets roster in a backup role, with Williams finding creative ways to use him.

26264551,"PITTSBURGH -- Antonio Brown didn't want to leave Pittsburgh without saying goodbye.
Brown purchased electronic billboard spots in downtown Pittsburgh with the message ""Thank You Pittsburgh, AB 84"" with Brown's signature and a picture of the All-Pro receiver.
Antonio Brown said the opportunity to play for Raiders coach Jon Gruden was a factor in his decision to work out a trade to Oakland. Brown said he aims to hold his teammates to a high standard and a personal goal is to pass Jerry Rice's receptions record.
Brown was traded to the Oakland Raiders after nine seasons with the Steelers. The matching billboards on the corner of Boulevard of the Allies and Grant Street were ordered by Brown himself and posted Thursday.
Brown's introductory news conference in Oakland on Wednesday ended a bizarre two-plus months between Brown and the Steelers, who received a third- and a fifth-round pick in exchange for Brown. Brown frustrated the organization by skipping work in Week 17, which sparked the team's interest in trading him.
But Brown requested a trade in late January and later disparaged the organization on social media and in an interview with ESPN's Jeff Darlington. His bizarre behavior on social media coupled with his demand for a new contract made trading him for significant draft capital difficult.
But Brown used his Oakland news conference to express gratitude for his time in Pittsburgh.
""To any kid out there from Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh will always be my family,"" Brown said. ""Those guys gave me a chance when I was a 21-year-old kid. Obviously, people are listening to the things that are being said and written. At the end of the day, it's all about how you make people feel. I think I made people feel good and great, really inspired, the way they watched me work, the way they watched me play. I know Steeler Nation is having a bad day today, but it's always love. I encourage every kid who watched me work and was inspired by everything I've done. I hope I continue to be a good example, continue to be a good role model and continue to inspire people.""
Brown recorded an NFL-record six consecutive 100-catch seasons with the Steelers.
