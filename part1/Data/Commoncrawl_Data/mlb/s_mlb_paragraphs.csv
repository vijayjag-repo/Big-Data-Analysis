26058350,"Philadelphia Phillies managing general partner John Middleton flew to Las Vegas on Friday night to meet with free-agent outfielder Bryce Harper in his hometown, sources confirmed to ESPN's Jeff Passan.
Barring something unexpected, Harper and the Phillies did not consummate a deal Friday night, league sources told Passan. It is more of a chance for the sides to explore whether they are mutually interested in the long-term deal Harper is seeking, sources said.
While the potential loss of Bryce Harper could be a big blow to Washington's lineup, an offseason defensive overhaul might be the difference-maker in a tough National League East fight.
The Nationals have had plenty of time to get used to the idea of playing without Bryce Harper -- and it shows at their camp in Florida.
Some teams take a stars-and-scrubs approach, some have depth but lack star power. We sort them all out and figure out who's on top.
The Phillies also met with Harper in January in Las Vegas. And the offseason began with Middleton saying, ""We're going into this [free agency] expecting to spend money. And maybe even be a little bit stupid about it.""
On Thursday, the San Diego Padres signed the other big name of the free-agent market, Manny Machado, to a 10-year, $300 million deal. It is the biggest free-agent contract in American sports history.
Other teams known to have met with Harper this winter include the San Francisco Giants, Chicago White Sox, Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers and Washington Nationals, with whom Harper spent the first seven seasons of his career.
Harper, 26, is looking for a deal in excess of the 10 years, $300 million the Nationals reportedly offered him at the end of the regular season. The left-handed-hitting Harper batted only .249 in 2018 but had 34 home runs and 100 RBIs and came on strong after the All-Star break.
The Phillies were 11th in the National League in runs scored last season, and their right-handed-heavy lineup could use a lefty power hitter.
NBC Sports Philadelphia was first to report that a representative from the Phillies was in Las Vegas on Friday.

26156306,"Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Wednesday that, for now at least, Kershaw remains scheduled to start March 28 for the two-time defending NL champions even though it seems unlikely based on the progress the three-time Cy Young Award winner would need to make in the next few weeks.
""I don't think we've made that decision yet, and I know that Honey [pitching coach Rick Honeycutt] has mapped out where we need to be, so right now, we're not ready to make that decision,"" Roberts said. ""We're just right now in a day-to-day with Clayton and trying to keep him in a positive state of mind.""
Kershaw played catch with teammate Rich Hill on Tuesday's off day and lined up down the right-field line with fellow pitchers Wednesday as several played catch. Kershaw's partner was bullpen catcher Steve Cilladi.
Although Cilladi did not crouch, Kershaw went into his unique windup before several throws, raising his hands over his head and pausing his leg in midmotion. Kershaw repeatedly backed up, eventually throwing from more than 75 feet, before moving closer to Cilladi and increasing the velocity on his throws.
Afterward, he flashed a thumbs-up to an observer and gave Cilladi a fist bump.
Prior to the afternoon throwing session, Roberts said: ""The distance is increasing a little bit, and most importantly, the intensity. So, for him to ramp up that intensity and recover the next day and still feel good, that's a good thing for us.""
As for when Kershaw will throw off a mound, Roberts said: ""We'll know more each day. We don't have a day right now.""
CATCHING ON
After several days of practice and Cactus League inactivity because of a sore lower back, veteran catcher Russell Martin started hitting and caught Walker Buehler's bullpen.
""Today is the first day I took some swings and I just got done, so it felt pretty good,"" Martin said. ""Obviously, it wasn't max effort, but it was definitely positive.""
Martin progressed from dry swings to hitting off a tee to soft toss.
""So far, so good,"" he said. ""We are taking it slow and trying to be smart about it.""
Martin's training room treatment has consisted of stretching, strengthening and ""getting some range of motion and strength in that newfound range of motion, and hopefully, that will keep me on the field,"" he said.
Roberts said: ""It is kind of a day-to-day thing -- depending on how Russell feels and the training staff -- whether we get him some at-bats on the other side [in minor league games] or just jump him right in and DH or just kind of throw him in the fire. Russell, as a veteran player, knows exactly what he needs to do to get ready, so even a week down, I don't think it will impact him too much.""
NOTES
Buehler has not appeared in a Cactus League game. Roberts said the right-hander is likely to throw live to hitters on Saturday or Sunday.
SS Corey Seager, completing his recovery from Tommy John surgery on May 4 and arthroscopic hip surgery on Aug. 7, was not in camp because of ""a little kind of a sickness, a little bug,"" according to Roberts. Because of that, Seager's planned appearance in a minor league game Thursday is doubtful.
Roberts and his staff will start to make cuts in the coming days, sending players to the minor league side. Position players will start to play in back-to-back Cactus League games, and starting pitchers will begin to throw increased innings in those games.
The Dodgers optioned LHP Adam McCreery and reassigned LHP Josh Smoker and RHPs Joe Broussard, Daniel Corcino and Jesen Therrien to minor league camp.

26048494,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- When it comes to filling big shoes, Matt Adams has nothing on Babe Dahlgren and Ryan Minor.
Dahlgren is the man who replaced Lou Gehrig in the New York Yankees' lineup the day that the Iron Horse's consecutive-games streak ended. Nearly 60 years later, Minor is the one who stepped in for Cal Ripken Jr. Two decades after that, Adams is the answer to this trivia question: Who moved into Bryce Harper's locker?
Last year, Adams' first in Washington, his cubby was just around the corner from Harper's in the Nationals' oval-shaped spring training clubhouse. This year, when the veteran slugger reported to camp after signing a one-year free-agent deal to remain with the Nats, he found his jersey hanging in Harper's old spot. For what it's worth, he isn't losing any sleep over the relocation.
""I respect the guy and everything, but to me it's just a locker,"" Adams said. ""If I'm getting caught up in whose locker I'm in, then my mind's not in the right spot.""
With a stagnant market turning free agents into freeze agents, the lefty's six-year, $140 million pact with the Nats sticks out like a sore thumb.
Max Scherzer took a shot at MLB's free agency, saying teams getting on the win-loss cycle creates bandwagon fans and poisons the game.
Not only could Manny Machado's $300 million pact increase the price tag for Bryce Harper, it also could lead to even heftier free-agent hauls for Mookie Betts and Mike Trout in two years.
The same goes for Adam Eaton, who's expected to take over the full-time right-field gig that belonged to Harper for the better part of the past seven years. ""I played the position last year. I played it before he was born,"" joked Eaton, who's four years older than Harper but made his big league debut in 2012, the same year that Harper won the National League Rookie of the Year.
Of the 603 games that Eaton has played in his career, almost a third of them have come in right field. That includes 113 games with the White Sox in 2016, when Eaton saved more runs in right field (22) than anyone not named Mookie Betts. It also includes 65 contests last season, when Harper was busy moonlighting in center field. As you might expect, Eaton isn't the least bit concerned with following in the former MVP's footsteps.
""The media puts a lot of emphasis on it, but we're professionals,"" Eaton said. ""We've just got to go out there and play. If George Herman Ruth was here and he left, we'd be like, 'That's cool. He was here, now he's gone.' Everyone's on the same page.""
Of course, it doesn't hurt that everyone has seemingly been talking about Harper's potential exodus from Washington since ... well, since Washington himself was in the White House. In other words, the Nationals have had more than enough time to prepare themselves for the possibility of Harper taking free-agent flight. And it shows.
""Knew it was a possibility. We knew that last year,"" said ace Max Scherzer, who knows a thing or two about high-profile free agents switching teams. In 2015, Scherzer came to Washington on a seven-year, $210 million deal, after having spent the previous five seasons in Detroit. Four years later, he's completely matter-of-fact about the prospect of life after Harper. ""Look, teams change. It's part of the thing.""
The thing that Scherzer refers to is the business of sports. And like any business -- whether it's banking, building or baseball -- the bottom line is the loudest line. That's why, when the Nationals signed hurler Patrick Corbin to a splashy six-year, $140 million contract in December, the writing was on the wall. And what the wall said was this: The odds of the Nationals -- who were above the luxury tax last season and still have to think long and hard about shelling out serious cash to give third baseman Anthony Rendon a contract extension sometime in the very near future -- retaining Bryce Harper just shrunk faster than a slice of bacon sizzling on a hot skillet.
Does that mean the Nationals won't re-sign Harper? Not necessarily. Now that Manny Machado is finally off the board and $300 million richer, is there any chance that his free-agent foil doesn't end up in a Phillies (or some other) uniform, owner of a contract that's decidedly larger than the $300 million one that Washington supposedly offered Harper at the end of last season? Sure, there's a chance. But for now, Everyone -- with a capital E -- in the Nats organization seems more than prepared to move ahead without him. More than prepared to get on with the business of baseball.
""Would I love for him to be here? Of course,"" said first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, who's spent his entire 14-year career in Washington and played alongside Harper longer than any other current member of the Nationals, and whose spring training locker is right next to Adams' cubby. ""But we all understand the business and the economics. That's just how it works. You get so used to the shuffling in and out of players. You get used to learning how to deal with it.""
Rookie of the Year hopeful Victor Robles celebrates ""scoring"" during a running drill here at #Nationals camp. #SpringTraining pic.twitter.com/YpiI6WHX5c
But what if Harper winds up with a division rival like Philly? What if, over the course of the next 10 years, the Nationals have to face their former franchise face 180 times during the regular season?
""It doesn't bother me wherever he goes,"" Zimmerman said. ""He's earned the right to do that. Will it be weird playing against him? Of course. But we've all played against people that we've been teammates with. I just hope he gets what he deserves. He's done some pretty special stuff at a young age. He should get rewarded for it.""
That last part, the part about getting rewarded and getting what he deserves, is a common theme. To a man, pretty much every single player inside the Nationals clubhouse seems to genuinely want Harper to get what's his. Because they know that if and when the time comes for them to hit free agency, they'll do everything in their power to get what's theirs. They're all together on this. After all, the players' union isn't called a union for nothing. As a result, everyone seems to be pulling for Harper to cash in, regardless of which front office is handing out that cash.
How do the best at each position rank and what tier of production do they fit in?
Positions: First basemen | Third basemen | Outfielders | Starting pitchers
That even goes for Nationals pitcher Erick Fedde, who grew up with Harper in Las Vegas and has known him since T-ball: ""It's a presence you'll miss in the clubhouse, but baseball's taught you to accept that sometimes you're going to lose friends."" Fedde admits that ever since the end of last season, anyone and everyone has been asking him where Harper is going to sign. His answer? ""I don't know. But I hope it's whatever's best for him.""
What's best for the Nationals right now -- and they're more than happy to tell you this -- is worrying about the guys who are in West Palm Beach instead of The Guy who isn't.
""We're going to talk about the players that we have here on the team,"" said GM Mike Rizzo, when asked about Harper a few days into spring training. ""We're not going to talk about the players that we don't have on the team. We've got a roster that we like, and we're poised to start the season as is because we really like the team that we have.""
Added manager Davey Martinez: ""I can't really think about the free agents. I've got 58 guys in camp. ... We're going to focus on the guys we have today and get them ready to play.""
In the meantime, it's worth noting that not all uniform numbers have been treated equally within the Nationals clubhouse. While the numbers of several prominent but now departed members of last year's team have been redistributed -- reliever Kyle Barraclough is wearing Daniel Murphy's old No. 20, and Gio Gonzalez's 47 now belongs to Howie Kendrick -- the No. 34 is currently not in circulation. Maybe that's just a coincidence. Then again, maybe it's not.
Maybe the Nationals are intentionally ""resting"" Harper's digits, the same way they rested Jayson Werth's No. 28 for a year before handing it out this season.
You know, just in case he comes back.

26069009,"Barely more than a week after Manny Machado picked the San Diego Padres, Bryce Harper is headed to the Philadelphia Phillies. What does the deal mean for baseball's new $330 million man, the team that signed him and the rest of baseball? We asked ESPN baseball writers Eddie Matz, Bradford Doolittle, Sam Miller and David Schoenfield to break it down.
Gut reaction: Do you like this deal for the Phillies?
Bradford Doolittle: Yeah, it kind of had to happen, didn't it? Thirteen years seems surreal on the face of it, but I thought $330 million for 10 years would work for the Phillies, so the extra length only serves to keep the average annual value down for tax calculation purposes. Whether it's three, four or even six upside-down seasons at the back end of the contract, it should be worth it. The Phillies are all in, as they should be after keeping their payroll down the past few years, and have the dollars and the minor league talent to fill holes over the next few years. Get ready, NL East fans: It's on.Bryce Harper to the PhilliesThere were other huge  offers out there, but the mutual commitment made the difference for Bryce Harper and the Phillies. Jeff PassanMiller: Baseball's LeBron? How we were right -- and wrong -- about Bryce Law: Win-win deal | Winners, losers

There were other huge  offers out there, but the mutual commitment made the difference for Bryce Harper and the Phillies. Jeff Passan
Miller: Baseball's LeBron? How we were right -- and wrong -- about Bryce
 Law: Win-win deal | Winners, losers
Eddie Matz: What's not to like? They got the guy they wanted (well, one of them). He fills some crystal-clear needs (corner outfielder, lefty stick). And all it cost them was some stupid money. Well, a whole lot of stupid money. But hey, if you can't spend it, then what's the point?
Sam Miller: From 2009 through 2014, the Phillies' payroll was consistently $50 million to $70 million more than the league average. Then, as the crucial part of their rebuilding process, they cut it to $40 million below league average in each of the past three years. It's not just that a team of Philadelphia's market size can easily afford a player like Harper making $25 million to $30 million a year. It's that the whole point of everything the Phillies just put their fans through was to clear payroll so they could sign Bryce Harper (or somebody like him). It's not just a deal I like; this deal was something of an imperative.
David Schoenfield: Here's a slightly different take: We're all focusing too much on the money and whether the Phillies paid too much. We don't know! The Albert Pujols contract looked great for the Angels at the time. The bigger issue: How good will Harper be? From 2016 to 2018 -- which admittedly ignores his monster 2015 season -- Harper ranked 22nd in the majors in wRC+ according to FanGraphs, behind Matt Carpenter and Tommy Pham, among others. Of course, there's always the hope that he can come close to 2015 again. Are the Phillies betting on that? Or are they simply betting on eight seasons or so of Harper being a top-15 hitter in the game? Will they be happy if that's the case? What if he is already morphing into a player with ""old player"" skills (more walks, lower average, bad defense)? The AAV is low enough that the contract probably won't haunt the Phillies, but there's also a chance they just gave the biggest contract in MLB history to a very good hitter, but not a dude who is one of the top 10 players in the game.
Who is the biggest winner of Harper joining the Phillies?
Doolittle: I'm assuming there will be a little initial pushback in Philly about this since the protracted nature of the negotiations sends the message that Harper didn't really want to play there. I'm sure there will be a love-hate relationship that develops between Harper and that fan base. But that's all good stuff! And Harper, who set his sights on Cooperstown long before he got to the majors, will have a better chance to put up huge numbers in Citizens Bank Park than he would have in either Dodger Stadium or (especially) The Orc.
Matz: Um, Bryce Harper. Generally speaking, any time you can sign your name on a piece of paper and you are thereby guaranteed to earn a third of a billion dollars (give or take), you're a winner in my book.
Miller: The Phillies. The headlines to this deal will note that it's the biggest contract in baseball history. But relative to the sport's growth in revenue, and relative to previous megadeals to pre-decline superstars, this one isn't expectations-shattering, and the cost of the far-distant seasons at the end of the deal isn't particularly daunting. In fact, it basically looks like the 10-year, $330 million deal you'd have reasonably expected for Harper -- with three ""free"" years tacked onto the length.
Schoenfield: I agree with all of the above. But you know who else is a winner in all this? Rob Manfred. For all the kvetching from fans, players and baseball Twitter all winter about the slow pace of free agency and suggestions of collusion or something close to it, in the end Harper got $330 million and Manny Machado got $300 million. Manfred's argument to let the market play itself out seems to be correct. The stars got their big deals. (And, yes, some quality free agents like Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel still remain unsigned.)
Who is the biggest loser of Harper joining the Phillies?
Doolittle: The Braves took a very measured approach to this offseason, much to the chagrin of a lot of their fans. On the very same day that reports came out about Atlanta's huge surge in revenue, this happens. I know the Braves want to see how their roster grows organically with a good collection of young players -- including some high-ceiling position players -- on the way. But if none or few of those players stick and the Braves end up looking up at a Harper-led Phillies squad the next few years, those glowing revenue reports might fade fast.Potential Phillies lineupWith Bryce Harper headed to Philadelphia, this is what the Phillies lineup could look like this season:LF Andrew McCutchen

Matz: Um, Bryce Harper. When Harper fails to run a hard 90 down the line, or when he goes through bad stretches -- and there will be bad stretches -- he won't know what hit him. It'll be the vitriol from Philly fans, who couldn't possibly be any more different than those in D.C.
Miller: These deals always have a ton of uncertainty, and that uncertainty grows each year the further out you go, but the one thing we can usually state with some clarity is that the player who signs a $330 million contract will probably be pretty good in Year 1. It just so happens that Year 1 looked like it could be one of the closest NL East races ever, with the Braves, Phillies, Mets and Nationals all projected (by some systems) to win between 85 and 89 games. So it's awful timing for the Braves, Mets and Nationals that this was the year the Phillies would get Harper, that this was the year the Phillies could most confidently bank the value of his superstardom. This deal will quite possibly flip the NL East title. Of course, those other three teams could have offered Harper 13 years and $335 million, and there's a good chance that in five years Harper's deal will still look eminently reasonable and they'll all regret that they didn't.
Schoenfield: I'll go with the Giants. What is their game plan? They have an old and expensive team and if they are intent on contending in these waning years of the Buster Posey/Madison Bumgarner/Brandon Crawford team, they needed a power bat for the league's worst outfield. They didn't get it. More so than the Dodgers or even the Phillies, they needed Harper for their lineup.
Which player do you think will provide the most value on his new deal: Machado or Harper?
No Manny Machado or Bryce Harper, but extensions for Luis Severino and Aaron Hicks? Things worked out just fine the last time the Bombers locked up their core and complemented it with shrewd trades.
Can you steer well enough to not run over Teddy Roosevelt? You could land an MLB job with the Nats. Here's what else the team was looking for in this week's tryouts.
Doolittle: It kind of depends on how quickly things come together in San Diego. You can see a scenario in which Machado has his best seasons there before the Padres' window is fully open, while Harper ends up having a splashy, J.D. Martinez-like first season in Philly. In terms of in-a-vacuum performance, these guys are very close, and I would expect them to remain that way, even though Harper's defense could be a growing issue. (If he needs to move to first, what happens with Rhys Hoskins?) Still, I'd take Harper on this question because I think he'll have more cracks at his value contributing to pennant contenders.
Matz: Machado. He's way better defensively and will stay healthier in the long run. That's why he'll win the WAR war.
Miller: I like Harper's deal more for the Phillies, and I think I like Harper more as a player in five years, but both teams should be happy.
Schoenfield: Machado's premium defensive ability and durability make him the better bet to earn the value of his contract -- but the Phillies are the better team and more likely to make some World Series appearances, so maybe that means Harper is the better value.
Which player do you think will appear in a World Series for his new team first: Machado or Harper?
Doolittle: Harper. The Padres need to piece together a big league rotation, and they may continue to be blocked by the Dodgers for the next few years. The Phillies' competition in the NL East will be rough, and the field there is more crowded at present than what the Pads have in the West. But there are just more ready-to-win veterans for Philadelphia, and if the Phillies can bob to the surface in that division, they'll be World Series-caliber. Could even happen this season.
Matz: Harper.
Miller: The Phillies' chances are considerably better this year, and beyond that, forecasts tend to flatten out. If neither player has won one in the next five years, I'll say the Yankees will trade for both and they'll make the World Series together. (No-trade clauses are merely openings for negotiations.)
Schoenfield: Harper and the Phillies. At this point, the Padres still only have one proven star: Machado. (Sorry, Eric Hosmer doesn't count). They'll need to hit on a lot of those prospects before they're close to the Dodgers or even the Rockies.

26218488,"""He's earned it. Obviously, the way he pitched last year, the way he came to camp as a No. 1 guy, his arm feels great and he's ready to go,'' manager Chris Woodward said, according to the Dallas Morning News. ""Mike's got a different way about him. He's almost possessed.''
The left-hander finished 12-8 with a 4.18 ERA in 28 starts for the Rangers last season, his first with the team.
He signed a three-year contract with Rangers after the 2017 season when he pitched exclusively in relief for the Kansas City Royals, finishing with a 2.55 ERA in 65 appearances. He began his career as a starter with the Atlanta Braves, going 38-36 in 110 starts from 2010-14 but had shoulder surgery in 2015 and didn't pitch that season or in 2016.
""I've always been labeled a No. 5 or a 3 or a 4. I believe I can be an ace,"" Minor told reporters Sunday, according to the News.

26024155,"When Patrick Corbin signed with the Washington Nationals back on Dec. 7 for $140 million over six years, it didn't seem that anomalous. Sure, it was relatively early in the hot stove cycle. Yes, a six-year contract for a 29-year-old hurler with a Tommy John surgery on his résumé might have been a little on the lengthy side. But all in all, based on historical norms, the deal was within reason. Two months later, with a stagnant market turning free agents into freeze agents, Corbin's pact sticks out like a sore thumb with a Day-Glo thimble on it.
Just how conspicuous is Corbin's contract? His $140 million is more than twice the amount Red Sox hurler Nathan Eovaldi, who signed the second-richest contract of any free agent this offseason (four years, $67.5 million). In fact, it's more than the value of the next three largest free-agent deals combined. It's also $140 million more than Dallas Keuchel has gotten so far (the former Cy Young winner is still up for grabs). All of which raises the question, how exactly did Patrick Corbin win the winter?
As winter bleeds into spring, here's how the free-agent landscape looks right now.

It all started with a canceled honeymoon. After getting married at the Mountain Shadows Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Nov. 17, Corbin and his new bride, Jen, were planning on celebrating with a jaunt to Puerto Vallarta. But the business of being a free agent -- the top starter on the market, to be exact -- got in the way. It happened quickly.
The Phillies, whose owner made headlines in November when he talked about spending ""stupid money"" this offseason, came a-courtin'. So too did the Nationals, a franchise whose recent success has been fueled by a seemingly unquenchable thirst for elite starting pitching. The Yankees, who had obvious holes in the rotation and whom Corbin rooted for as a child growing up in Syracuse, were also firmly in the mix.
Although Corbin says he enjoyed his visits with all three of his primary East Coast suitors, it was his trip to D.C. that stood out. For openers, as soon as his quintet -- the pitcher, his wife, agent John Courtright, Nats GM Mike Rizzo and owner Mark Lerner -- entered Fiola Mare, a swanky Georgetown seafood spot, they found themselves getting frisked and wanded because Vice President Mike Pence happened to be dining in the back room.
""That was kind of different,"" Corbin said.
But the most unique thing about that dinner meeting was the straightforward manner in which Rizzo and Lerner communicated their interest. Over a symphony of food and drink that included oysters and pinot noir and tiramisu, the two men held court at the circular five-top and refused to be coy, as has become the custom in MLB front offices these past couple of years. Instead, they presented the franchise's one-year, three-year, and five-year plans. They discussed neighborhoods and school systems with the newlyweds. The fact that the owner of the team was at the table spoke volumes. ""We were trying to impress,"" Rizzo said. ""We know no other way.""
It's an M.O. that's all but lost in the polar vortex that is today's MLB marketplace. As one veteran agent put it: ""The problem the last two years in free agency is that let's say you have Babe Ruth. You could call darn near every team and it would be like holding a gun to somebody's head to get a GM to say, 'Hey, you know what? Your guy Babe is pretty good. I like him.' What you would hear is, 'Well, you know what, the way we look at it, there's like six Babe Ruths out there.'""
The top outfielder on the free-agent market is set to make big bucks. We put you in Bryce Harper's shoes. Where will you go?
Washington reeled in a big-name free agent while the star outfielder is still on the market. Here's what the addition of Patrick Corbin means for Bryce Harper's chances of returning.
Small-market teams aren't watching rich teams sign all the top free agents anymore. They're watching rich teams sign all the top free agents -- at discounts.
In Corbin's case, going full blast after their No. 1 target meant adding a sixth year to the deal, something the Phillies and Yankees weren't willing to do. Neither were the Angels, who originally drafted Corbin and were also in on the southpaw. Not that anyone could blame those clubs: Before last season, when Corbin posted a career high in strikeouts, a career low in WHIP, and finished fifth in the Cy Young voting, the jury was still out on him. In 2013, the former second-round pick was an All-Star with Arizona. But the year after that, he underwent Tommy John surgery and missed the whole season. Two years after that, in 2016, he struggled so much he was banished to the D-backs' bullpen. Even including his monster 2018 campaign, the three pitchers Corbin is most similar to at this point in his career, according to Baseball-Reference.com, are -- wait for it -- Jon Niese, George Stone and Erik Hanson.
Nevertheless, the Nationals, coming off a deeply disappointing season and convinced the 2018 vintage of Corbin -- the one who ratcheted up his slider usage beyond 40 percent and introduced a slow curveball -- was not a mirage, put on the full-court press. Just like they did in January 2015, when they gave Max Scherzer $210 million to be their ace, even though their rotation had been the best in baseball the previous season. Because, as Rizzo is fond of saying, you can never have too much starting pitching. It worked.
""It just felt like the Nationals wanted me the most,"" Corbin said as he stood in front of his locker at the Nationals' spring training complex in West Palm Beach, Florida. ""And I think they showed it by adding that sixth year and coming after me aggressively.""
It didn't hurt that when the Corbins returned to the Four Seasons after dinner that night, they bumped into Nats cornerstone Ryan Zimmerman and his wife, Heather, who just so happened to be out on a date at the hotel's steakhouse. Zimmerman, who has spent his entire 14-year career in Washington, didn't give Corbin the hard sell -- instead he told the hurler to ignore the money and just pick the place that felt most comfortable. Meanwhile, Heather and Jen chatted about what it's like living in the D.C. area. The couples chatted in the lobby for half an hour. Before they parted, the players exchanged phone numbers. The next day, news broke that Corbin and the Nationals had reached an agreement.
Two days after that, Corbin sat on a podium at Nats Park, with Rizzo by his side and Lerner seated in the front row. Scherzer and Zimmerman were in attendance too, along with starter Stephen Strasburg and new catcher Yan Gomes. ""I'm excited to join the ballclub and be a part of something special,"" Corbin said. ""Just excited to join the guys and glad I'm part of the family.""

Right then and there, it was clear the Nats had won Corbin's heart. And he'd won theirs. But that's not all Corbin won. Two months later, when spring training began and dozens of free agents were still flapping in the breeze -- including Harper and Machado -- and with no other offseason contract coming even remotely close to Corbin's, it became abundantly clear he'd won the winter.
As glorious as that may sound, perhaps it's a dual-edged sword. The whole ""with great power comes great responsibility"" thing. Even in ordinary times, a $140 million contract carries with it the pressure to perform, to justify. But these are not ordinary times. And so maybe that same $140 million contract -- the one that dwarfed every other deal that has been consummated over the past three and a half months -- carries with it even more pressure. Then again, maybe not.
""I don't feel any different coming in here,"" said Corbin, whom Nats manager Davey Martinez has described as the consummate professional and very intense. ""It's like a normal offseason. Only thing is, new teammates, and a new staff that I'm trying to get familiar with. I'm just going to try to get ready for the season and try to get better. But I don't feel any different really.""
Of course, whatever pressure Corbin might have felt is probably more than offset by the soft landing that is having Scherzer and Strasburg ahead of him in the Washington rotation. Indeed, being the most highly paid No. 3 starter in all the land does have its perks.
""That was a big key for us to come here,"" Corbin said of Scherzer and Strasburg. ""You have to have good starting pitching to win. They're the best in the game. I get to watch them every day and try to get better.""
In the meantime, Corbin is adjusting to the new normal. He and Jen haven't bought a home yet, instead opting to rent for a year while they figure out the lay of the land in the District. Almost comically frugal in the past -- the car he bought in 2010 after receiving a $450,000 signing bonus was a used one, and he lived with his parents after his rookie season -- Corbin has learned to let it loose a little. Especially when it comes to restaurants.
""We're foodies,"" he said before going off on a tangent about how he's actually the spender in the family. ""I have to tell her to go and get stuff sometimes,"" he said of his wife, then noted how she recently came home bragging she'd just bought a $175 pair of jeans. ""That's the first time she's ever done that.""
It probably won't be the last. Because that's how it goes when you win the winter.

26275276,"A judge dismissed the charges Friday after Dykstra pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was fined $125.
Dykstra said he is ""happy this chapter of my life is behind me.""
The three-time All-Star, who was a member of the New York Mets' 1986 championship team, said the driver tried to kidnap him in May 2018 in Linden, New Jersey, after he asked to change the trip's destination.
The driver told police Dykstra held a gun to his head, though no weapon was found.
Dykstra's attorney, David Bahuriak, previously called the incident ""overblown"" and that his client was innocent.
Bahuriak had filed a motion to suppress evidence before the judge's ruling, saying that a police search of the man's belongings was improper and there were no witnesses to the alleged threat.
The judge granted the motion, telling Dykstra, ""I hope you have learned a lesson from this.""
The driver told NJ.com that it was important Dykstra entered a guilty plea. He said Dykstra has ""admitted to what he did in my car.""
A kidnapping complaint filed against the driver is pending.
Since retiring from baseball, Dykstra, 56, has served prison time for bankruptcy fraud, grand theft auto and money laundering.
He is currently facing a summons for illegally renting out rooms in his home for $1,000 each.

26235002,"Los Angeles announced agreements Monday with 22 players not yet eligible for arbitration. Ohtani has a split contract with a salary of $272,500 while in the minor leagues.
The 24-year-old two-way star went 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA in 10 starts as a pitcher and played 104 games overall as a rookie, hitting .285 with 22 homers and 61 RBIs. He had surgery Oct. 1 to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament, and the Angels think the earliest he could be ready to hit in games is in May. He isn't expected to pitch this year.
Ohtani left the Nippon Ham Fighters of Japan's Central League after the 2017 season and signed with the Angels for a bonus of $2,315,000. He will not be eligible for salary arbitration until after the 2020 season.
He will earn considerably more than Tampa Bay pitcher Blake Snell, last year's AL Cy Young Award winner. The Rays renewed his contract Sunday for a salary while in the majors of $573,700, a raise of $15,500 and a figure $18,700 above the major league minimum, which rose to $555,000.

26031704,"Former Los Angeles Dodgers pitching great Don Newcombe has died after a lengthy illness, the team announced Tuesday. He was 92.
""Don Newcombe's presence and life established him as a role model for major leaguers across the country,"" Dodgers president Stan Kasten said in a statement. ""He was a constant presence at Dodger Stadium and players always gravitated toward him for his endless advice and friendship. The Dodgers meant everything to him and we are all fortunate he was a part of our lives.""
Newcombe, one of the first African-American pitchers in MLB, joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1949, winning Rookie of the Year while helping the team win the NL pennant.
In Newcombe's debut season, he and Dodgers teammates Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella became three of the first four African-Americans (along with Cleveland outfielder Larry Doby) to appear in an All-Star Game.
After a break to serve in the military during the 1952 and '53 seasons, he returned, and with the likes of Robinson, Campanella, Duke Snider, Gil Hodges and Pee Wee Reese, helped create a World Series champion.
The Dodgers won it all in 1955, and Newcombe went 20-5 with a 3.20 ERA to help get them there.
""Don Newcombe had a ton of talent and he was a great competitor,"" Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda said in a statement. ""He was a helluva player, and he was one of the best hitting pitchers I have ever seen.""
Newcombe's best season came in 1956, when he led the league with 27 wins and won the Cy Young and MVP awards and led the Dodgers to another NL pennant. But the Dodgers lost the Series to the Yankees in seven games, and Newcombe dropped the deciding contest, giving up two home runs to Yogi Berra.
He never reached the same lofty heights again. After an 0-6 start to the 1958 season (the organization's first in Los Angeles), he was traded to the Reds. He won 13 games in 1959 but only six split between Cincinnati and Cleveland in 1960, his last season.
""Don was a mentor at first, a friend at the end,"" said Dodgers legend Sandy Koufax. ""He will be missed by anyone who got to know him.""
After he retired, Newcombe revealed that a drinking problem contributed to the downfall of his career. In the mid-1960s he became sober and worked with various organizations to help curb teenage drinking.
""Don was admired by Dr. Martin Luther King and he was a big champion in the fight for equality along with Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella,"" longtime Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully said in a statement. ""The former 27-game winner was an even bigger winner when he overcame his battle with alcoholism and helped others whenever he could. He truly was a big man on and off the field and he will be missed by all.""
Newcombe finished his 10-year MLB career as a four-time All-Star with a 149-90 record and 3.56 ERA.
The New Jersey native began his professional career in the Negro Leagues in 1944.
""Anytime you lose somebody that you know is a sad thing. But he lived a pretty incredible life, great story, a pioneer for a lot of different things in baseball,"" said Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw. ""Just getting to know him over the years, great man, and he'll be missed, for sure.
""The Dodger uniform meant a lot to him. Before he got older and traveling was tough, he used to speak to us every spring training. You could just tell what it meant to him.""

26190498,"Those three rule changes are among a wide variety of experiments that the Atlantic League will run this season as part of its new partnership with Major League Baseball. The changes, announced Friday, include:
• Using a TrackMan radar system to help umpires call balls and strikes
• Extending the distance between the pitching rubber from 60 feet, 6 inches to 62 feet, 6 inches in the second half of the season
• Mandating that two infielders are on each side of the second-base bag when a pitch is released, with the penalty being a ball
• A three-batter minimum for pitchers -- a rule MLB and the MLB Players Association are considering for the 2020 season as they near an agreement on a smaller set of changes
• No mound visits, other than for pitching changes or injuries
• Increasing the size of first, second and third base from 15 inches to 18 inches
• Reducing the time between innings and pitching changes from 2 minutes, 5 seconds to 1 minute, 45 seconds
While MLB has long tested potential rule changes in the minor leagues, its three-year partnership with the Atlantic League -- an eight-team league that features former major leaguers trying to return to affiliated ball -- offers the ability to try more radical rules.
Major League Baseball's new partner is breaking out some drastic rule changes. Here's what the Atlantic League innovations mean and how likely they are to hit the majors.
""This first group of experimental changes is designed to create more balls in play, defensive action, baserunning, and improve player safety,"" Morgan Sword, MLB senior vice president, league economics and operations, said in a statement. ""We look forward to seeing them in action in the Atlantic League.""
MLB has chafed at using technology to replace ball-and-strike-calling duties for umpires, fearful that it's not yet consistent enough to warrant implementation. While MLB has used a 60-foot-6 mound distance since 1893, the strikeout spike and lack of balls in play led league officials to wonder what effect a longer distance would have. Commissioner Rob Manfred has suggested banning infield shifts, and with the TrackMan system installed at Atlantic League stadiums, MLB will have a trove of data to analyze and see the effect of doing so.
Entering its 21st season, the Atlantic League has eight teams: the High Point Rockers in High Point, North Carolina; Long Island Ducks in Central Islip, New York; New Britain Bees in New Britain, Connecticut; Somerset Patriots in Bridgewater, New Jersey; Lancaster Barnstormers in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in Waldorf, Maryland; Sugar Land Skeeters in Sugar Land, Texas; and York Revolution in York, Pennsylvania.

26234314,"We've unveiled out MLB Rank top 100 (100-51 and 50-1), so now we're asking our panel of baseball writers for reactions -- and we're asking you for your takes as well.
Surprises, reaction to top 100 | How did we do last year? | More MLB Rank
David Schoenfield: Nothing really jumps out at me as an egregious surprise. I'm a little surprised that Alex Bregman at No. 7 ranked higher than Jose Ramirez at No. 14, mostly because Ramirez has had back-to-back top-three MVP finishes, while Bregman has had just one big season. I'm a little surprised that Joey Votto fell only 17 spots to No. 26. While he led the NL in OBP, he had just 12 home runs and 42 extra-base hits -- not the kind of power production you expect from a first baseman. Of course, both Bregman and Votto are eminently capable of justifying their rankings.
Bradford Doolittle: I think probably too many of us have jumped off the Kris Bryant bandwagon a little too quickly. He's still a top-10 or top-15 player in my book, so No. 21 is a little light. Are we really saying we'd take J.D. Martinez over him? Blake Snell? Still and all, though, I think this was a pretty solid ranking of players.
Eddie Matz: Nothing jumps out at me, really. I'd classify J.T. Realmuto (No. 28) as someone who maybe hopped out at me. I mean, there's no denying that he's a quality player on both sides of the ball. But top-30 seems a little high to me. Maybe all the offseason trade buzz filtered in here somehow and pushed him about 10 or 15 spots ahead of where he should be. I definitely wouldn't put him ahead of Anthony Rendon.
Sam Miller: Nobody is going to make the top 30 about whom I'm going to have much bad to say, but if I'm picking somebody I could most easily see falling into the 70s or 80s after this year, it'd be Blake Snell (No. 12). His track record as a truly elite pitcher is short, and he still has to work around more walks than his peers at the top of this list. Here we have him as the fourth-best pitcher in baseball; according to ZiPS, to pick one projection system, he's ""only"" 17th. That's still phenomenal, but it's a tier below this.
Schoenfield: A little too high. The guy two spots below him is Mitch Haniger, who produced a 6.1-WAR season in 2018. The only 20-year-old position players to produce even 5.0 WAR since 1960 are Johnny Bench, Ken Griffey Jr., Jason Heyward, Manny Machado and Mike Trout. There's no doubt that Vladdy Jr. can hit, but I'm not sure he's the all-around player those guys were, and I'm not completely convinced he's going to be a big-time power hitter at age 20.
A major shake-up brings a new crew of All-Stars to the forefront, with some of the game's biggest names on the outside looking in.
Leading off our countdown of the game's best, youngsters duel with historic greats. Which players landed on the back half of our list?
Doolittle: A tad high. Certainly Ronald Acuna Jr. and Juan Soto showed that very young standout prospects can have immediate impacts. Guerrero is more than capable of following in their shoes. But in terms of expectation for his rookie season, somewhere in the 80-90 range is probably more appropriate. But 68 is a reasonable slot. I actually thought it might be higher, just because the hype machine has been so relentless.
Matz: My gut says he's too high and that for all the (justifiable) hype, it's time for a little brake-pumping. Then again, last year's stud rookies (Acuna and Soto) finished 42nd and 43rd in position player WAR last season. Mix in the pitchers and that puts them in the 60-something range. So it comes down to this: Will Vlad Jr. make as much of an impact as Acuna and Soto did last season? Maybe. But the fact that he's already dinged up (oblique) casts some doubt.
Miller: Boy, I don't know. I see my colleagues here saying ""too high,"" but then I look at most of the names around him and none of them makes me happy like Vladito makes me happy. So I'm saying too low. Going just by how happy he makes me, he should probably be second on this list. He hasn't done anything to prove that he belongs in the top tier of this list, but he has done even less to disprove it.
Schoenfield: Cody Bellinger fell off from his big rookie season, so he slid 38 spots, from No. 23 to No. 61. I think he's going to have a better season, with more home runs, a better walk rate and a higher OBP. In fact, he's on my short list of NL MVP candidates.
ESPN Insider Buster Olney discusses the MLB Rank top 100 and more with old friend Jayson Stark on the BBTN podcast. Listen
Doolittle: I'm naming two, since they are both Dodgers and rated closely together: Corey Seager (No. 49) and Justin Turner (No. 53). Both are easily top-30 players if healthy, and by all appearances, they appear to be. If Seager can get into 140-150 games, he's probably more like top-15 and is more than capable of making a run at National League MVP. Dave is right about Bellinger as well.
Matz: Like Brad, I'm all aboard the Turner train -- the other Turner. Trea Turner isn't the .342 hitter that his rookie season suggested. But he isn't the .271 guy he was last season, either. Somewhere in between lies the truth. His plate discipline was much improved last year (69 walks), and his power will continue to come (19 HRs in 2018). If Adam Eaton stays healthy at the top of the Nats lineup and with a full year of Juan Soto hitting behind him, Turner (No. 54) could be in for a big year.
Miller: German Marquez (No. 81) had a 2.61 ERA in the second half last year and backed it up with 12 strikeouts per nine innings and six K's for every walk. His K rate went up every month of the season, and in September, he struck out 37.5 percent of batters -- a mark that only Max Scherzer, Gerrit Cole, Chris Sale, Blake Snell, Justin Verlander and James Paxton managed to top in any month last season. He did all this as a Rockie. He's a miracle.
Schoenfield: Mookie Betts is the obvious candidate since you can argue that 2018 was the first season when there actually was somebody better than Trout. But my other choice is Juan Soto because he has a chance to be the best hitter in the game, cranking out .450 OBPs with 35-plus home runs. What he did as a teenager -- .292/.406/.517 -- was so unfathomably impressive that I might even be underestimating his upside.
In his first exclusive interview since joining the Phillies, Bryce Harper goes deep on rejecting $300 million, recruiting Mike Trout and playing in Philly for life. Tim Keown
Doolittle: This is the topic for my column running on Friday, so I must abstain. Stay tuned.
Matz: Mookie Betts. I know, boring pick, but it's pure logic here. If Trout isn't the best player in baseball, then Mookie is. If Trout stumbles for some reason (injury or otherwise), Mookie's the obvious heir to the throne. He's only 26, so the five-year hypothetical window takes him to age 31, at which point he'll still be at or near his prime. After Betts, my order of succession is Lindor, Bregman, Acuna.
Miller: Francisco Lindor is an elite shortstop who just hit 38 homers and stole 25 bases as a 24-year-old. His 7.9 WAR last season is already better than that of the average MVP winner, he draws a few more walks each year, and he's still carrying a ton of doubles that might turn into even more home runs. Mookie, of course, must be mentioned, but Lindor's stats at 23-24 have looked a fair bit like Alex Rodriguez's at 22-23.
On Monday, prior to the results being known, we asked our writers for their predictions as to who would be underranked and overranked. Here's whom they picked, with the actual rankings in parentheses:
Most likely to be underranked
Matz: Ozzie Albies (58) or Trea Turner (54)
Doolittle: Cody Bellinger (61)
Miller: Carlos Correa (27)
Schoenfield: Brandon Nimmo (unranked)
Most likely to be overranked
Matz: Christian Yelich (7) or Lorenzo Cain (56)
Doolittle: Vlad Guerrero Jr. (68)
Miller: Khris Davis (63)
Schoenfield: Some closer, perhaps Edwin Diaz (36)
Who was right? Only time will tell.

26087908,"The agreement allows MLB to implement changes to Atlantic League playing rules in order to observe the effects of potential future rule changes and equipment in the majors.
According to Baseball America, those changes could include moving back the mound and using a computerized data system, called Trackman, to call balls and strikes, as well as to send in-depth data about every pitch and ball put into play in the Atlantic League.
Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said management is focused on pace-of-game changes for 2019, and bolder ideas suggested by players such as expanding the designated hitter to the National League are too complicated to be put in place this season.
MLB and the MLB Players Association are discussing potentially drastic rule changes, sources told ESPN. A three-batter minimum for pitchers, a universal DH and a 20-second pitch clock are among the items discussed.
If MLB wants to speed up pace of play, it should. But as an olive branch, grandfather in veterans like Max Scherzer.
Several proposed rule changes and experimental equipment will be announced in the coming weeks, according to a joint statement from MLB and the Atlantic League.
""We are excited to announce this new partnership with the Atlantic League,"" said Morgan Sword, MLB's senior vice president for league economics and operations. ""We look forward to bringing some of the best ideas about the future of the game to a highly competitive environment.""
""The Atlantic League prides itself on innovation,"" league president Rick White said. ""In that spirit, our board of directors, led by chairman and founder Frank Boulton, enthusiastically and unanimously approved this forward-looking agreement.""
In the past, MLB has used the Arizona Fall League as its testing ground. But the Atlantic League offers players with more experience. More than 40 percent of Atlantic League players have major league service time, and most have spent time in the minors.
Entering its 21st season, the Atlantic League has eight teams: High Point Rockers in High Point, North Carolina; Long Island Ducks in Central Islip, New York; New Britain Bees in New Britain, Connecticut; Somerset Patriots in Bridgewater, New Jersey; Lancaster Barnstormers in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in Waldorf, Maryland; Sugar Land Skeeters in Sugar Land, Texas; and York Revolution in York, Pennsylvania.

As one example, Justin Turner comes in at No. 53 and all he has done the past three seasons is finish ninth, eighth and 14th in the MVP voting. That's a pretty good 53rd-best ballplayer in the majors.

That leads us to this question: Who's next? For each team, I've nominated one candidate to be the next player from that franchise to appear on MLB Rank -- not necessarily in 2020, but at some point in the future. The only rule: The player can't be on this year's list -- so Mike Trout for the Phillies or Gerrit Cole for the Dodgers doesn't count, as much fun as that would be to speculate. It's OK if a player has appeared on a previous MLB Rank top 100.
The teams are ordered based on points earned in the 2019 rankings: 100 points for the No. 1 player, 99 for No. 2 and so on, down to one point for No. 100. So, argue away ...
Who made it this year?  (7 players, 480 points) -- Alex Bregman (6), Jose Altuve (10), Justin Verlander (22), Carlos Correa (27), Gerrit Cole (30), George Springer (37), Roberto Osuna (95)
Next:  Josh James, RHP
You might have expected to see top prospects Forrest Whitley or Kyle Tucker here, but both were already sent back to minor league camp and might not see Houston for a few months, so they're more on a 2021 or 2022 timetable to crack the top 100. Meanwhile, I'm all-in on James and his 100 mph fastball. His spring training was slowed by a strained groin and he's just getting back on the mound, so he won't be ready for the opening rotation, but when he is, watch out.
Who made it this year?  (9 players, 437 points) -- Aaron Judge (11), Luis Severino (23), Giancarlo Stanton (31), James Paxton (43), Aroldis Chapman (47), Gary Sanchez (67), Gleyber Torres (78), Miguel Andujar (84), Aaron Hicks (88)
Next:  Masahiro Tanaka, RHP
This is interesting. Over the past three seasons, Paxton is 29-18 with a 3.52 ERA over 417 ⅓ innings, while Tanaka -- pitching in much more of a hitters' park -- is 39-22 with a 3.83 ERA over 534 innings. Yet Paxton comes in at No. 43 and Tanaka is unranked. Don't be surprised if Tanaka has the better season and cracks the top 100 next year.
Who made it this year?  (6 players, 412 points) -- Francisco Lindor (8), Jose Ramirez (14), Corey Kluber (16), Trevor Bauer (39), Carlos Carrasco (44), Brad Hand (73)
Next:  Mike Clevinger, RHP
Maybe if Clevinger got into more fights on Twitter and posted videos of his workouts he'd rank higher. Over the past two seasons, Clevinger has quietly posted a 3.05 ERA in 321 ⅔ innings, while his more publicized teammate Bauer has a 3.20 ERA over 351 ⅔ innings. I'm not necessarily saying Clevinger is better, but 2018 was Bauer's first season with an ERA under 4.00. Look for more good things from Clevinger and maybe a higher top-100 ranking next year than Bauer.
Who made it this year?  (7 players, 405 points) -- Mookie Betts (2), Chris Sale (9), J.D. Martinez (17), Andrew Benintendi (50), Xander Bogaerts (57), David Price (69), Nathan Eovaldi (98)
Next:  Eduardo Rodriguez, LHP
Rafael Devers certainly has top-100 potential, but his defense and plate discipline will keep him below that bar for at least another year. The Red Sox feel Rodriguez has the ability to put everything together this year and become a rotation anchor. He has been working on a new slider to go with his 93 mph fastball and outstanding changeup. Various injuries -- knee surgery in 2017, an ankle injury last year -- have limited him to a career high of 24 starts, so he needs to stay healthy and get to 180-plus innings.
Who made it this year?  (6 players, 354 points) -- Max Scherzer (3), Anthony Rendon (32), Juan Soto (35), Stephen Strasburg (46), Patrick Corbin (52), Trea Turner (54)

Next:  Victor Robles, CF
Why did the Nationals ultimately feel comfortable letting Bryce Harper walk? Because they know Robles is ready to step in. Heck, Robles might have cracked this list this year if he hadn't injured his elbow early last season attempting a diving catch in Triple-A. He's a career .300 hitter in the minors, projects as a plus defender in center, will steal some bases and has power potential if he adds a little more launch angle. But even if he's just a 15-homer guy, he has the all-around game to become an All-Star. ZiPS already projects a solid 2.5 WAR for his rookie season.
Who made it this year?  (5 players, 314 points) -- Bryce Harper (15), Aaron Nola (24), J.T. Realmuto (28), Rhys Hoskins (45), Jean Segura (79)
Next:  Nick Pivetta, RHP
The Phillies have reason to be optimistic beyond Harper and all their other offseason acquisitions. Acquired from the Nationals for Jonathan Papelbon in 2015, Pivetta should be near the top of any list of potential breakout pitchers. The stuff is there as evidenced by a 27.1 percent strikeout rate that ranked 13th among qualified starters -- one spot ahead of Nola. The question: Was his .326 BABIP the result of the porous Phillies defense, or does he simply lack the fastball command to make the leap to the next level? He might also be wise to consider ditching his two-seamer (batters hit .379/.471/.569 against it). He's not a lock to improve, but he's the best ""next"" choice for the Phillies given the farm system lacks can't-miss prospects.
Who made it this year?  (6 players, 300 points) -- Clayton Kershaw (41), Walker Buehler (42), Corey Seager (49), Justin Turner (53), Kenley Jansen (60), Cody Bellinger (61)
Next:  Gavin Lux, 2B/SS
Look, if Max Muncy rakes again -- .263/.391/.582 with 35 home runs in 2018 -- he'll crack this list next year. I do believe in his bat, as his ability to control the strike zone should allow him to tap into his power, but some regression in the home run rate is expected (he had the 10th-highest rate of home runs to fly balls), and it's not certain how much he'll play against lefties. So I'll go with one of my favorite minor leaguers in Lux, who had a breakout season, hitting .324/.399/.514 at age 20 between Class A and Double-A. I love the bat-to-ball ability and the left-handed bat, although he'll probably wind up at second base.
Who made it this year?  (6 players, 277 points) -- Jacob deGrom (4), Noah Syndergaard (25), Edwin Diaz (36), Robinson Cano (82), Zack Wheeler (83), Michael Conforto (99)
Next:  Brandon Nimmo, CF
Nimmo became the first Mets hitter to post a .400 OBP since David Wright in 2007; it was just the 11th .400 OBP season in team history. He might be a little stretched on defense in center field, but if he posts another .400 OBP and 4.4 WAR season, he'll easily crack the top 100.
Who made it this year?  (5 players, 228 points) -- Kris Bryant (21), Javier Baez (29), Anthony Rizzo (38), Willson Contreras (92), Jon Lester (97)
Next:  Yu Darvish, RHP
Kyle Hendricks remains criminally underrated with WAR figures of 5.4, 3.5 and 3.5 the past three seasons, good for 10th-best among starting pitchers in total WAR over that span. MLB Rank tends to reward peak value more than consistency, however, and Hendricks is unlikely to come close to the 2.13 ERA he had in 2016. Anyway, Darvish's first season in a Cubs uniform was a disaster, but I'm banking on a comeback and the big strikeout totals that jazz up his reputation.
Who made it this year?  (4 players, 228 points) -- Christian Yelich (7), Josh Hader (33), Lorenzo Cain (56), Yasmani Grandal (80)

Corbin Burnes and Brandon Woodruff will be intriguing to watch as they move into the rotation, but let's see if their stuff plays up as well as it did out of the bullpen last season. Hiura is the team's top prospect, the ninth overall pick in 2017 out of UC Irvine with a highly regarded bat. He reached Double-A last year and hit .293/.357/.464 between two levels with 13 home runs in 485 at-bats. I'd like to see him improve his walk rate (just 36 walks in 535 plate appearances), and he'll really have to hit as his glove isn't considered special.
Who made it this year?  (5 players, 225 points) -- Nolan Arenado (5), Trevor Story (48), Charlie Blackmon (55), German Marquez (81), Kyle Freeland (91)
Next:  Brendan Rodgers, SS/2B
I'm still a Jon Gray believer, but I'll go with the more obvious choice in Rodgers, the team's top prospect. I'm not completely sold on Rodgers: The one minor league stop where he has put up monster numbers was at Class A Lancaster, which is like Coors Field on steroids. He doesn't walk much or run much, and with Trevor Story entrenched at shortstop, his future position with the Rockies will be second base, which puts even more pressure on the bat. He'll spend this season at Triple-A and figures to compete with Garrett Hampson and Ryan McMahon for the starting job in 2020. Hmm, maybe Gray does put it all together and beats Rodgers into the top 100.
Who made it this year?  (4 players, 218 points) -- Freddie Freeman (18), Ronald Acuna Jr. (20), Ozzie Albies (58), Josh Donaldson (90)
Next:  Touki Toussaint, RHP
Mike Foltynewicz couldn't quite crack the top 100 even after a 2.85 ERA in 2018, but maybe the voters were right. His season was heavily BABIP influenced, and now he's out with a sore elbow and will miss his Opening Day start. Ender Inciarte (No. 98 last year) has an argument as a three-time Gold Glove winner in center field, but I'm going with one of the Braves' young pitchers. Toussaint isn't likely to be an overnight sensation, and he might even end up in the bullpen long term, but his stuff is ridiculous, and if he puts it together he has more upside than more polished arms Kyle Wright or Mike Soroka.
Who made it this year?  (4 players, 179 points) -- Paul Goldschmidt (13), Matt Carpenter (40), Miles Mikolas (76), Marcell Ozuna (96)
Next:  Jack Flaherty, RHP
This one is easy. I love Harrison Bader, but he's probably more Kevin Pillar than peak Kevin Kiermaier, whereas Flaherty has Cy Young potential -- the staff ace the Cardinals kept expecting Carlos Martinez to grow into. As a rookie, Flaherty's strikeout rate ranked 10th among pitchers with at least 150 innings and his .199 batting average allowed ranked ninth. He has looked sharp already this spring, including one outing when he fanned nine in four innings. Flaherty should not only crack the top 100, but I look for him to crack the top 50.
Who made it this year?  (4 players, 169 points) -- Matt Chapman (34), Blake Treinen (51), Khris Davis (63), Matt Olson (87)
Next:  Stephen Piscotty, RF
He's not flashy, but Piscotty hit .267/.331/.491 with 27 home runs and 41 doubles, including a .272/.337/.536 line in the second half. His walk rate fell from 13.0 percent in 2017 to 6.9 percent, so if he can reverse that and improve his OBP, he'll slide into the back end of the top 100.
Who made it this year?  (3 players, 164 points) -- Mike Trout (1), Andrelton Simmons (64), Shohei Ohtani (74)
Next:  Jo Adell, OF
Justin Upton is certainly capable of top-100 numbers in any given season, or maybe Matt Harvey finds a time machine and travels back to 2015, but Adell, a consensus top-10 overall prospect, is the best bet. He reached Double-A last year at 19 after starting in the Midwest League, surprising even the Angels with his rapid ascent after they tabbed him with the 10th pick in the 2017 draft. He has already grown into his big-boy body, and he has future star written all over him. He could reach the majors later this year and team with Trout in the Angels outfield in 2020 and maybe crack this list in 2022 ... with hopes that Trout is still alongside him.
Who made it this year?  (5 players, 130 points) -- Joey Votto (26), Eugenio Suarez (77), Raisel Iglesias (85), Yasiel Puig (93), Scooter Gennett (94)
Next:  Nick Senzel, CF/IF
Keith Law's No. 6 overall prospect is the logical answer here. Senzel has done nothing but rake since getting drafted second overall in 2016 with a .314/.390/.513 line in the minors. He's a natural third baseman, but the Reds are trying him out in center field this spring, taking advantage of his athleticism to fill the team's biggest hole. The obvious concern is health. He missed time last year with vertigo and a broken finger, then had elbow surgery to remove bone spurs.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 89 points) -- Blake Snell (12)
Next:  Tommy Pham, LF
It speaks to the impressive depth the Rays have built that they won 90 games last year and yet only one of their players cracked the top 100. Pham finished 11th in the MVP voting with the Cardinals in 2017, but an awful two-month slump in May and June last year sent him to Tampa, where he posted a 1.071 OPS in 39 games. Pham was No. 78 on this list last year, and I'm taking the over on his 2.7 WAR projection from ZiPS for another top-100 ranking.

Who made it this year?  (1 player, 82 points) -- Manny Machado (19)
Next:  Fernando Tatis Jr., SS
Look, it could be almost any of the Padres' promising youngsters: Joey Lucchesi or Luis Urias or Francisco Mejia or Franmil Reyes or Chris Paddack. Heck, maybe Wil Myers has a bounce-back season, and let's not forget Eric Hosmer was on this list 12 months ago. But everyone is already drooling about a Machado-Tatis left side of the infield, with good reason. Tatis will need some time in Triple-A, and he'll have to curb some swing-and-miss issues, but he should be a star by 2021.
Who made it this year?  (2 players, 69 points) -- Buster Posey (62), Madison Bumgarner (71)
Next:  Joey Bart, C
I mean ... look, Brandon Belt and Brandon Crawford aren't washed up, but you can't really project them as top-100 players moving forward. Maybe Bart is the next Buster Posey, but he's a catcher entering his first full professional season, so he's several years away. Considering Bumgarner could get traded and Posey is returning from hip surgery, it's possible the Giants have nobody on this list next year.
Who made it this year?  (2 players, 36 points) -- Jameson Taillon (66), Starling Marte (100)
Next:  Ke'Bryan Hayes, 3B
Hayes ranked 18th on Keith Law's prospect list, thanks to a glove that Law said makes Hayes ""a likely 80-grade defender at third base with unbelievable hands and instincts."" He's still growing into his power -- he hit seven home runs in Double-A -- but he controls the strike zone and should hit for average. He's a unique prospect, but it seems the worst-case scenario is peak Placido Polanco, and that's a top-100 player.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 36 points) -- Zack Greinke (65)
Next:  Robbie Ray, LHP
Ray was on this last a year ago at No. 49, but scuffled through some injuries and went 6-2 with a 3.93 ERA over 24 starts. (And, yes, getting only eight decisions was weird; he's the first pitcher with that many starts and so few decisions in MLB history, not including Tampa Bay opener Ryne Stanek). The stuff is still filthy -- 165 K's in 123⅔ innings -- and he finished strong with a 3.23 ERA in the second half.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 33 points) -- Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (68)
Next:  Danny Jansen, C
This is a tough one since Vladdy Jr. would have been the obvious choice except he's the rare rookie to crack the top 100. Marcus Stroman is a bounce-back possibility, but if he pitches well he's a candidate to be traded in July, so he might make this list in 2020 for a different team. Let's go with Jansen, the rare catching prospect who can hit. He posted an .884 OPS in 2017 and .863 at Triple-A in 2018. He controls the strike zone (44 walks, 49 strikeouts), and if he can post an .800 OPS in the majors, he's going to make some All-Star teams.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 31 points) -- Mitch Haniger (70)
Next:  Yusei Kikuchi, LHP
This offseason, the Mariners traded away four players in the top 100 -- Edwin Diaz, James Paxton, Jean Segura and Robinson Cano. With them, Seattle would have ranked 13th in our points system, between the Braves and Cardinals, but instead rank 23rd with its lone representative. They also don't have a clear candidate to crack this list anytime soon. Marco Gonzales is a nice midrotation starter, and Justus Sheffield and Justin Dunn are good pitching prospects, but hardly sure things. Jarred Kelenic, acquired in the Diaz trade, was just drafted last year and is years away. So how about Kikuchi? He's a polished veteran lefty, and a lot of Japanese pitchers seem to do well their first season in the majors. He could sneak his way in to the bottom of the top 100 next year.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 29 points) -- Jose Berrios (72)
Next:  Byron Buxton, CF
Coming off a wild-card berth in 2017, the Twins had three players on this list last year: Buxton (No. 56), Brian Dozier (No. 60) and Miguel Sano (No. 77). Things could not have gone worse for that trio as they combined for just 0.2 WAR and each battled injuries as the Twins fell under .500. Buxton's projections are wildly unpredictable, but we know he can play center field. If he stays healthy and hits even a little bit, he's a valuable player.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 26 points) -- Whit Merrifield (75)
Next:  Adalberto Mondesi, SS
Mondesi is already a top-100 fantasy player heading into 2019 because of his ability to swipe 50 bags, but I'm not sold on him reaching the top 100 on this list just yet. He had a terrible strikeout-to-walk ratio of 77-11, and batted-ball data said he was fortunate to produce an OPS of .804. Still, he can run and his defensive metrics were above average.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 12 points) -- Jose Abreu (89)
Next:  Eloy Jimenez, RF
For the second straight year, Abreu is the lone White Sox player on the list, and this ranking is rather generous given his mediocre 1.7-WAR campaign in 2018. The rebuild has gone slower than expected as youngsters such as Yoan Moncada and Lucas Giolito have struggled and Michael Kopech had Tommy John surgery in August. Jimenez, however, looks like the real deal -- Keith Law's No. 5 prospect. He's the rare power prospect who doesn't strike out much, and he's ready to make an immediate impact in 2019.
Who made it this year? Nobody
Next:  Jose Leclerc, RHP
Nine relief pitchers made the top 100, but not Leclerc, who had a 1.56 ERA and was the toughest pitcher to hit (.126 average, one home run) in 2018. The Rangers just signed him to a four-year, $14.75 extension that also includes two option years. Leclerc should make that contract look like a steal. Then again, baseball history is littered with relief pitchers who had 50 great innings, and Leclerc is one season removed from walking 40 batters in 45 innings.
Just over two weeks before Opening Day, two prominent free agents remain available. We find realistic landing spots and outside-the-box fits for both pitchers.
The games don't count. The numbers won't make the back of any baseball cards. But in camps across the Cactus and Grapefruit leagues, what happens now could still make a difference.
In our spring MLB stock watch, we examine who gained (and lost) the most wins during the offseason with the biggest names finally off the market.
Who made it this year? Nobody
Next:  Casey Mize, RHP
I really wanted to list Miguel Cabrera, but he has been worth minus-0.2 WAR the past two seasons. At age 36, you can't really predict a big comeback -- but that doesn't mean he can't have one. Let's go with Mize, last year's No. 1 overall pick who should advance quickly through the minors.
Who made it this year? Nobody
Next:  Brian Anderson, 3B/RF
Anderson had 3.9 WAR as a rookie last year -- a higher figure than Juan Soto, Walker Buehler, Gleyber Torres and Miguel Andujar. He's not flashy, but he hit .273, has doubles power, draws some walks and did well playing two positions. All he needs to do is improve a little bit across the board. The ZiPS projection has him at 2.7 WAR and not improving at the plate -- he does turn 26 in May -- but I think there's top-100 potential here.
Who made it this year? Nobody
Next:  DL Hall, LHP
It's possible the next top-100 player for the Orioles isn't even in the organization yet. Hall is the only prospect to crack Law's top 100 (at No. 63) after dominating the South Atlantic League in his first full professional season. Still, it's a long way from low-A to the majors, so he's several years from making any impact.

26025602,"The Cincinnati Reds star led the National League in on-base percentage last year but hit just 12 homers, his fewest in a full season, and batted .284, his lowest since 2014. He had 67 RBIs.
""It was the first year where I had a poor offensive year,"" Votto said. ""It is hard to speak on this without sounding arrogant. I've always performed at a certain level. Last year was a bit of a shock. I didn't perform anywhere near to what I'm used to.""
Votto, who turns 36 in September, was hit on the right knee by a pitch from Ryan Madson in August and went on the disabled list. His numbers were down even before the injury.
Votto hit 37 homers during his 2010 NL MVP season and had 36 with 100 RBIs in 2017. He spent this offseason refining his swing.
""I did things differently, so I hope it works,"" Votto said. ""Intuitively, I know why I wasn't ready and came up short last year. I just made sure I didn't do that again and learn from my mistakes. I feel very confident. I'm excited to work.""
Votto is owed $25 million annually through 2023, and the Reds have a $20 million option for 2024 with a $7 million buyout. He has spoken over the years about his desire to help the Reds become a winning team again.
Cincinnati overhauled its roster following its fourth straight season of 94 or more losses, adding starting pitchers Alex Wood, Sonny Gray and Tanner Roark along with outfielders Yasiel Puig and Matt Kemp.
""We've added All-Stars,"" Votto said. ""We've added guys with long track records. They have a lot of things to gain by playing very well here. Hopefully, we carry that into a winning performance.""

26034573,"After several incidents of alleged stealing of catchers' signs last season, including during the postseason, commissioner Rob Manfred had promised to have new directives in place this year to curtail the practice.
The Astros, after being investigated for alleged sign-stealing during the ALCS, were cleared of any violations by MLB, which considered ""the matter closed"" on Wednesday.
MLB and the MLB Players Association are discussing potentially drastic rule changes, sources told ESPN. A three-batter minimum for pitchers, a universal DH and a 20-second pitch clock are among the items discussed.
MLB already had a rule in place that prohibited sign stealing from any place other than a runner on second base. That rule would now be updated to include measures that address the use of new technology to gain an advantage on opponents.
Among the new rules, according to the SI.com report, would be:
A ban on in-house outfield cameras from foul pole to foul pole.
Live broadcasts limited to each team's designated replay official, who in turn will be monitored by a security expert.
Having all other TV monitors, such as those in the clubhouse and bullpens, on an eight-second delay.
Penalties for violation of the rules would include the forfeiting of draft picks and/or international spending money, according to the report.
"
26084923,"Nolan Arenado and the Colorado Rockies have agreed to an eight-year contract, the team announced Tuesday night.
The contract is worth $260 million, locking up the star third baseman with a deal that could last through the 2026 season, league sources told ESPN.
The deal, which replaces Arenado's previous one-year contract, includes a full no-trade clause, according to sources.
After months of discussions, the agreement came together in recent days after the Rockies guaranteed an eighth season, according to sources. The deal, which will keep Arenado from reaching free agency after the 2019 season, will set a per-year record for position players. It also includes a player opt-out after the 2021 season.
All long-term deals carry risk, but Colorado and Arenado are the perfect storm of a franchise in win-now mode committing to a superstar cashing in at the right time.
Arenado, 27, is a four-time All-Star who has won a Gold Glove in all six of his major league seasons. He has led the National League in home runs three times, including 2018, when he hit .297/.374/.561 with 38 home runs and 110 RBIs.
While numerous teams were giddy at the idea of pursuing Arenado in free agency after the 2019 season, according to sources, he opted for the security of more than a quarter-billion dollars guaranteed by the Rockies. One of those teams was the Los Angeles Dodgers, who could step up their pursuit of current free agent Bryce Harper, with whom they met in Las Vegas on Sunday night, according to sources. The Dodgers are seeking a shorter-term deal than the decade-plus-long contract Harper is seeking.
Nolan Arenado has been one of baseball's elite power bats and run producers over the past few seasons. He's also the only player to have won a Gold Glove in each of the past six seasons.
The overall value of Arenado's deal fell short of the $300 million that free-agent third baseman Manny Machado received from the San Diego Padres, but it topped Machado's $30 million annual salary, as well as the $31 million Miguel Cabrera receives each year from the Detroit Tigers. Only Arizona Diamondbacks starter Zack Greinke, at $34.4 million, will have a higher average annual salary than Arenado's $32.5 million.
Over his first six seasons with Colorado, Arenado has hit .291/.346/.539 with 186 home runs and 616 RBIs -- both tops among NL players. His glove is widely regarded as even better than his bat, with highlight-reel plays practically a nightly occurrence.
"
26228513,"Estevan Florial, long considered among the top talents in the Yankees' farm system, had fallen in the eyes of national prognosticators. Rated by some to be a top-50 prospect in 2018, Florial found himself below that entering 2019.
ESPN's Keith Law, troubled only in part by the more than two-month injury from a broken hamate bone Florial endured last year, again had him just outside of his top 100.
""His competition, for me, is in the monuments,"" Yankees legend Reggie Jackson said.
After a season-ending concussion, the Yankees outfielder just wanted peace and quiet. But his doctor had a very different idea: Turn it up to 11.
As the slugger who took the Bronx by storm last season battles Greg Bird for a spot on Opening Day, he's focused on turning his biggest weakness into a strength.
All of which raises the questions: Is the 21-year-old center fielder still a rising star? Has the flame around the Bombers' former No. 1 prospect burned out?
The Yankees, for their part, say Florial is shining brighter than ever.
""He's got as high a ceiling as just about anyone in that clubhouse,"" manager Aaron Boone said earlier this spring. ""Nothing's changed there.""
Added veteran outfielder Brett Gardner: ""As talented as he is, it's not going to be long before we see him put it all together.
""He's got a bright career ahead of him for sure.""
The proof of that, the Yankees believe, rests with how Florial has performed both this spring and last.
A year ago, the outfielder showcased his best asset -- his speed -- by racing around the bases to the tune of three triples in 21 spring training games. His range in the field caught attention, as did the work he put in behind the scenes.
Fast-forward to this spring, and the Yankees say they believe there's even more reason for optimism.
Entering play this week, Florial had a .333 batting average with a .926 OPS, a home run, four RBIs and four stolen bases through only 10 spring training games. Although he still had seven strikeouts and only two walks, his pitch recognition -- one area where he has struggled in the past -- has generally improved.
""[I'm] trying to get more control of the strike zone,"" Florial said at the start of the spring.
A prime example of that came on one swing Florial had last Thursday in a game against the Phillies in nearby Clearwater. With two on in the top of the sixth, he made a midswing adjustment to a pitch riding middle-in, and stroked a hard liner over the wall in left-center.

The three-run, opposite-field shot had the visitors dugout buzzing about the lefty's sweet swing.
""I mean, wow. There is a short list of people who can hit a ball hard like that,"" Boone said to reporters after that game. ""I told that to Reggie Jackson on the bench.""
Jackson, according to Boone, turned to the manager and said he knew that list was short -- because the Hall of Famer was on the list.
Another Yankees legend, former infielder Willie Randolph, has been similarly moved by what he has seen from Florial this spring. Randolph went so far as to describe Florial as a ""young Bernie Williams"" to the New York Post last week. Considering Williams had his No. 51 jersey retired four years ago, that's not a bad comparison for the youngster to draw.
""The way he goes about his business, his work ethic, just his desire and his willingness to listen and to learn and get better, I don't see many 20-, 21-year-old kids come through here that are that mature,"" Gardner said.
That maturity manifests itself in the patience Florial exhibits. Days after the Yankees re-signed center fielder Aaron Hicks to a seven-year, $70 million extension, Florial was asked if he was nervous he might be considered a trade chip now. After all, the long-term investment in Hicks had to mean the Yankees saw little future for Florial, right?
""We love Hicks here. Who wouldn't like to have Hicks on their ballclub?"" Florial said. ""For me, I'm blessed to have him next to me, so I can learn from him.""
A lower back injury has kept Hicks out much of the past two weeks, giving Florial more chances.

General manager Brian Cashman has been pondering whether Florial's year should begin at Single-A Tampa (where he hit .255 with three homers, three triples, 27 RBIs and was 11-for-21 in stolen bases in an injury-shortened 75 games last year) or Double-A Trenton. If he begins at Double-A, it would be the highest level Florial has played in the Yankees' organization.
Signed out of the Dominican Republic in 2015, Florial has spent the past two springs as a non-roster invitee. In addition to showing off his power in this one, Florial has been let loose on the basepaths.
In a game last week against Atlanta, Florial led off the bottom of the seventh inning by beating out an infield single. Two batters and two outs later, the wheels came out again.
After stealing second base, the speedster advanced to third on a passed ball. Then he scored on a wild pitch. Florial had manufactured a run in a way the powerful Yankees (who set a single-season home run record last season with 267) don't often do.
These anecdotes -- the three-run home run and the blistering baserunning speed leading to a score -- are prime examples of why the Yankees remain high on Florial, even if others are lukewarm.
""He doesn't recognize pitches well enough to get to his tools. Florial has bat speed, power, running speed, athleticism, quick twitch and all the tools that glitter, but his ability to pick up pitch types is not good enough to put him into the top 100,"" Law wrote in January. Meanwhile, MLB.com's prospect rankings saw Florial fall a dozen spots this year, from No. 45 to No. 57, and, after being ranked No. 38 last year by Baseball America, he slipped off their top 100 entirely.
Still, Boone likes what he sees: ""His ceiling, it's why he's probably always considered the [Yankees'] No. 1 prospect. It's [a] good reason. I remember first seeing him last year and one of the things that grabs you is just how physical he is. He's good to look at. He looks the part. He's tall, he's built. Still obviously a very young man.
""I don't know if it's necessarily changed in my eyes, because I remember being really impressed with the way he looks on a baseball field.""
