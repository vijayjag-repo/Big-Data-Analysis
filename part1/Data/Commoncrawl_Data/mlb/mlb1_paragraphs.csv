26058350,"Philadelphia Phillies managing general partner John Middleton flew to Las Vegas on Friday night to meet with free-agent outfielder Bryce Harper in his hometown, sources confirmed to ESPN's Jeff Passan.
Barring something unexpected, Harper and the Phillies did not consummate a deal Friday night, league sources told Passan. It is more of a chance for the sides to explore whether they are mutually interested in the long-term deal Harper is seeking, sources said.
While the potential loss of Bryce Harper could be a big blow to Washington's lineup, an offseason defensive overhaul might be the difference-maker in a tough National League East fight.
The Nationals have had plenty of time to get used to the idea of playing without Bryce Harper -- and it shows at their camp in Florida.
Some teams take a stars-and-scrubs approach, some have depth but lack star power. We sort them all out and figure out who's on top.
The Phillies also met with Harper in January in Las Vegas. And the offseason began with Middleton saying, ""We're going into this [free agency] expecting to spend money. And maybe even be a little bit stupid about it.""
On Thursday, the San Diego Padres signed the other big name of the free-agent market, Manny Machado, to a 10-year, $300 million deal. It is the biggest free-agent contract in American sports history.
Other teams known to have met with Harper this winter include the San Francisco Giants, Chicago White Sox, Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers and Washington Nationals, with whom Harper spent the first seven seasons of his career.
Harper, 26, is looking for a deal in excess of the 10 years, $300 million the Nationals reportedly offered him at the end of the regular season. The left-handed-hitting Harper batted only .249 in 2018 but had 34 home runs and 100 RBIs and came on strong after the All-Star break.
The Phillies were 11th in the National League in runs scored last season, and their right-handed-heavy lineup could use a lefty power hitter.
NBC Sports Philadelphia was first to report that a representative from the Phillies was in Las Vegas on Friday.

26264268,"Click here to vote for your favorite from our ultimate $1 million HR Derby field.
Why he's my pick: Trout is the best at just about everything, so if he decided he wanted to win the Home Run Derby, he would win it. Might not hit the longest homers, but he'd just keep putting the same swing on the ball all through the competition. He would not tire out.
Why he's my pick: Please, I don't have to defend Giancarlo Stanton. We've all seen him dominate the Home Run Derby in the past and nobody hits more awe-inspiring monster blasts than Stanton.
Why he's more likely to win than Mike Trout: This isn't a WAR contest. Trout has never participated in a derby. We don't actually know if he'd be any good at it.
Why he's my pick: He already won one Home Run Derby, and although he declined to participate last year, you'd have to think a $1 million prize will make him reconsider in 2019. The guy has power to all fields and has been peppering the right-field bleachers all spring. That just means Progressive Field's mini-monster in left shouldn't be an obstacle for the righty in this year's derby.
Why he's more likely to win than Giancarlo Stanton: OK, if we're being perfectly frank, the difference between Judge and Stanton in a home-run-hitting contest is virtually nil. The two hulking outfielders both hit multiple 440-foot moonshots last season. Still, Judge has this relaxed, fluid, easily repeatable swing that would be the difference-maker over his teammate. Stanton's shorter, more explosion-based swing can seemingly get out of rhythm easier (the Yankees were quick in 2018 to attribute many of his career-high 211 strikeouts to a matter of timing). And in the derby, good rhythm is just as important as power.
Why he's my pick: I'll take the reigning champ, who put on a show in his home turf to win the 2018 derby. Harper has the perfect Home Run Derby swing -- loopy, with a high finish and produced by lots of torque. It might lead to highs and lows throughout the regular season, but it is perfect in this setting.
Why he's more likely to win than Aaron Judge: Judge has about 4 inches and 60 pounds on Harper, but they were basically even in isolated power last season. Judge's power comes much easier, of course, but Harper thrives in settings like these and might have the edge in endurance during the final round.
Why he's my pick: Since the start of 2016, nobody in baseball has hit more bombs than Davis, whose 133 homers over the past three years are nine more than the closest guy (Stanton). Even more impressive, the A's slugger has done it while playing half his games in a cavernous park that's one of the least homer-friendly stadiums around. At a perfectly ripe 31 years old, Davis has an edge on other contenders because he's neither past his prime (see: Cruz, Nelson) nor still growing into his power (see: Acuna, Ronald). Most importantly, the Oakland DH fits the prototype: He's not one of those well-rounded hitters who tend to flame out in derby competition. He's a masher and he knows it.
The votes are in and our experts have spoken. Here are our picks for the top 100 players in baseball.
Why he's more likely to win than Bryce Harper: I'm going to ignore the fact that last season, Harper's average home run distance of 409 feet (sixth in MLB among guys with 25-plus homers) was longer than Davis' 405 (13th). Instead, I'll focus on the fact that only two players have won the derby in back-to-back years (Ken Griffey Jr. and Yoenis Cespedes). So the odds are stacked against Harper. But wait, there's more. When Cespedes went back-to-back, he was playing for the A's, as was Mark McGwire when he won his derby title. If you're scoring at home, that's three derby winners for Oakland, tied for second behind the Yankees (4). If Harper had signed with New York, his derby odds might've been higher. But he didn't, so they're not.
Why he's my pick: As the only person in this draft to have written an article titled How To Gamble On The Home Run Derby -- a statistical deep dive into past results --I have a huge advantage in this draft, except for the fact that said article concluded ""it's basically entirely random."" More home runs negatively correlated to derby results, for instance. The only really smart selection is a shrug.
However, there were some factors that correlated positively (if weakly) to derby success. The biggest was left-handedness. The second biggest was, uh, let's call it heftiness -- weight. And the third was career batting average. Previous derby experience appears to be a negative quality. (I can plausibly speculate on why each of these would be so, but your time is valuable.) So, while it's tempting to say ""who hit the most home runs last year,"" the correct answer is ""who is the heaviest left-handed batter with at least plausible power?"" The best answers are Justin Bour, Kyle Schwarber, Anthony Rizzo and Adams. My article came out in 2014; since then Bour, Schwarber and Rizzo have all been in the derby, with Bour and Schwarber both doing very well. Adams is the second-heaviest of them, has the second-best career average and is the only one of the four who would be new to the derby. So: Matt Adams, my danged pick.
Why he's more likely to win than Khris Davis: Davis is a right-handed batter who spots Adams 42 pounds and 20 points of career batting average. I'm honestly not sure whether I picked Adams as an attention-getting gag or not, but I'm 95 percent certain he'd beat Davis.
Why he's my pick: With short porches down the line in left and right field and reasonable power alleys on both sides, Progressive Field invites home runs from players with across-the-diamond power -- and that is J.D. Martinez's wheelhouse. Factor in a perfect launch angle on home runs -- his was 28.2 degrees last season, almost the same as Trout and Judge -- and he's got the ability to scale the mini-monster down the left-field line, too. Best of all, Martinez knows his swing intimately and has the capacity to adjust it as necessary.
Why he's more likely to win than Matt Adams: Well, J.D. Martinez is J.D. Martinez, Matt Adams is Matt Adams, and that's that.
Why he's my pick: Like Harper from a year ago, Ramirez will get the hometown advantage as he wrestles the title away from the defending champ. Ramirez has quietly become one of the premier sluggers in the game and he'll win the inaugural $1 million prize with Cleveland fans cheering him on. It's a no-brainer.
Why he's more likely to win than J.D. Martinez: Sure, Martinez is a better hitter overall, but his game isn't set up for a HR Derby-type event. J.D. might win MVP in 2019, but he won't beat Ramirez in his home park.

26218325,"Her family said Stevens died Saturday morning at an assisted living facility in Henderson, Nevada, after a short illness.
""Julia was a loving wife, mother, grandmother and great grandmother who lived a wonderful, full life during the 102 years that she was with us,"" her family said in a statement posted on Babe Ruth Central's Facebook page.
Diane Murphy, a fellow resident at Prestige Senior Living at Mira Loma in Henderson, told The Associated Press that Stevens had lost her sight but remained bright and vibrant.
Stevens was part of a circle of residents who read books aloud, according to Murphy.
""She was so sharp and laughed at the right moments,"" Murphy said. ""She was a lovely lady.""
Even well into her 90s, Stevens threw out first pitches at baseball games across the nation, attended Hall of Fame induction ceremonies in Cooperstown, New York, and appeared at the annual Babe Ruth Little League World Series.
She authored three books about her famous father.
""As long as there is baseball, daddy's name is always going to be mentioned. He was one of a kind,"" Stevens once said. ""My goal in life is to keep his name alive. He was a wonderful father, and I remember him as that and just not as a baseball player.""
Stevens was adopted by baseball's biggest star soon after Ruth married her mother, Claire Hodgson, in 1929 when Julia was 12 years old. Hodgson died in 1976.
Julia was the older of two daughters adopted by Ruth. Dorothy Ruth Pirone, who was Ruth's daughter from a previous relationship, died in 1989 at age 67.
Tom Stevens told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in an interview earlier this year that it rankled his mother to be referred to as Ruth's stepdaughter.
He said Ruth proved to be a match to provide Julia a needed blood transfusion when she was hospitalized as a young adult.
""She said as far as she was concerned, between being adopted and the transfusion, 'I'm his daughter, period,'"" Tom Stevens said.
Babe Ruth retired in 1935, days after playing his last game. He was with the Boston Braves, starred for the New York Yankees from 1920-34 and the Boston Red Sox from 1914-19.
He died from cancer at age 53 in 1948.
""I sometimes wonder if the designated hitter rule would have been in effect when Daddy played, his career would've lasted much longer and he would've hit a lot more home runs,"" Stevens once said. ""It was his legs that gave out. He had trouble with his knees.""
Stevens said Ruth taught her how to dance and how to bowl and ""I couldn't have had a better father than him.""
She made her final trip to Yankee Stadium at age 91 in 2008 to say goodbye to one of her dad's favorite places where he hit many of his 714 career home runs.
Accompanied by her son, Tom, and two grandchildren, Stevens got a warm reception from the crowd before New York's 6-0 loss to Cincinnati.
A New York sportswriter dubbed the Bronx stadium ""The House That Ruth Built,"" and the Yankees retired Ruth's No. 3 during their 25th anniversary celebration of Yankee Stadium on June 13, 1948, the great slugger's final visit to the ballpark.
As Ruth's daughter, Stevens' family said, ""she had many amazing experiences, which she was pleased to share with eager reporters and fans alike. Until the very end, she was very proud to call him `Daddy' and she particularly loved recalling events from 1934 when she went on a `round the world' tour with her parents"" to Japan with a major-league all-star team.
Funeral plans for Stevens and a full list of her survivors weren't immediately available Sunday.

26210247,"CLEARWATER, Fla. -- Bryce Harper drew big cheers, a pair of walks and an unusual defense Saturday in his spring training debut for the Philadelphia Phillies.
Both times the slugger with the biggest contract in baseball came to the plate, the Toronto Blue Jays shifted to a four-man outfield, moved the shortstop on the other side of second base and gave the left-handed-hitting Harper a wide-open left side of the infield.
""I've never seen that. That's intense,"" Harper said, adding he hopes teams don't do that to him often. ""If they start playing ball like that, it's definitely different.""
Phillies manager Gabe Kapler didn't want to discuss shift strategy but shared his advice for Harper.
""Hit a lot of homers, drive the ball like you're capable of, do exactly what you always do, be Bryce Harper,"" said Kapler, who is known for using many shifts.
The Cubs, Astros and even the Rockies have employed a four-man outfield, but it was quite strange in an exhibition game.
No surprise, however, was the loud ovation fans gave Harper when he walked up to the plate to Will Smith's theme song from ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.""
Wearing No. 3 on his uniform, eye black under his eyes and a white armband with ""HEART"" written in red letters around it, Harper dug into the batter's box as ""In West Philadelphia born and raised ..."" blared from the stadium's speakers.
""The ovation they gave me, I'm very humbled, very blessed to be able to get out there and play in front of a fan base like that,"" Harper said, adding he'll probably use a different walk-up song once the season starts. ""Selling out a spring training game is pretty incredible to see. Just goes to show how great a fan base Philly is.""
Batting third as the designated hitter, Harper didn't go deep but jogged around the bases after Rhys Hoskins blasted a two-run homer off Jays right-hander Matt Shoemaker on the first pitch after the first walk in the first.
""Rhys is a special player,"" Harper said. ""Nice to see him jump on the first pitch and go deep. Having Rhys hit behind me, I'm very excited about it.""
Harper took a mighty swing and missed on the first pitch he saw, and fouled off the first pitch he faced in the third. He looked at eight balls outside the strike zone, including a few close ones. Although he is known for hitting home runs, Harper also is a patient hitter who knows how to work the count. He has a .388 career on-base percentage and had a career-best 130 walks last season.
Speculation about which superstars might join forces has been great for basketball. It can be great for baseball, too.
Coming off a season in which he finished third in the National League Cy Young Award voting, Aaron Nola will start for the Phillies on Opening Day, manager Gabe Kapler said Friday.
The Phillies are banking on their new right fielder returning to his peak performance, but historically, how likely is that to happen?
""It was fun to be out there, get some dirt on my cleats, get in the batter's box and compete. That's what I love to do,"" Harper said. ""I was able to see some pitches, take two swings early in the count, see some splits from a good pitcher, really happy where I was today.""
Kapler was impressed.
""That's who Bryce Harper is,"" the second-year manager said. ""He took some strong cuts and the balls he was taking, he was comfortable taking them. It certainly didn't look like his timing or rhythm was off. Looked like Bryce Harper as we saw him in a Nationals uniform last year, and he looks much better in a Phillies uniform.""
The six-time All-Star outfielder signed a $330 million, 13-year contract last week, surpassing the $325 million deal the Miami Marlins gave Giancarlo Stanton in 2014.
Phillies fans have embraced the superstar since his arrival.
Fanatics said Harper's No. 3 Phillies jersey was the all-time best-seller for any athlete during the first 24 hours of launch. The team store quickly ran out of letters and didn't have any more R's for adult jerseys in the first week. More than 340,000 tickets were sold within a week.
The 26-year-old Harper played his first seven seasons in Washington. He joked about the red Phillies pinstripes making him look slimmer.
""When you put Phillies across your chest, it means something to these people,"" Harper said. ""I'm excited about that. I'm very excited to be part of something bigger than myself.""
NFL Hall of Famer Brian Dawkins, a Philadelphia Eagles legend, gave the Phillies an inspirational speech in the clubhouse before the game and got the fans even more fired up when he welcomed the team onto the field.
Dawkins might be the most beloved athlete in Philly sports history. If Harper helps the Phillies win a few World Series championships, he could challenge for that title.
""It's been great being around the guys, being able to get into a clubhouse where everybody cares and really appreciates everything everybody does,"" Harper said, perhaps taking a shot at the Nationals. ""You can say that about the whole organization. People have been working here 20-25 years. It goes to show how much of a family it is here and how important people are to this organization.""
"
26107902,"In the meetings that led to him becoming the highest-paid athlete in the history of team sports, Bryce Harper kept coming back to one word: family. The protracted, bordering-on-interminable nature of his near-four-month-long free-agent odyssey never changed that. He knew what he was worth. He knew the teams courting him knew, too. He wanted to be paid, sure, but he also wanted to feel like his next team shared a shatterproof commitment.
So when Philadelphia Phillies owner John Middleton took his private jet from Florida to Las Vegas a week ago, he wasn't alone. Accompanying Middleton was his wife, Leigh. They wanted to show Harper and his wife, Kayla, that family mattered to them as well -- that they would compound years and dollars with actions that spoke to what he sought.
That alone didn't convince Harper to agree to a massive 13-year, $330 million deal with the Phillies on Thursday. It did inform other elements of the contract, namely the lack of an opt-out clause and presence of a full no-trade clause. While opt-outs were discussed during the negotiations, Harper, in the end, said he didn't want one. If he was going to convince others to join him chasing championships in Philadelphia, players needed to know he wasn't going anywhere.
There were other huge  offers out there, but the mutual commitment made the difference for Bryce Harper and the Phillies. Jeff Passan
Miller: Baseball's LeBron? How we were right -- and wrong -- about Bryce
 Law: Win-win deal | Winners, losers
And thus came a record-tying number of years, a record-breaking number of dollars and a 26-year-old MVP-winning outfielder decamping from the only team he'd known, the Washington Nationals, for their National League East rival. The signing, which will become official upon the completion of a physical set for Friday, could tip the power balance in the division toward the Phillies, who put a cherry on top of an already-fruitful offseason with the game's most recognizable player.
The deal is mutually beneficial. Philadelphia adds a middle-of-the-order bat to a lineup that already includes the homegrown Rhys Hoskins and a pair of dangerous trade acquisitions: catcher J.T. Realmuto and shortstop Jean Segura. It gets to sell tickets and sponsorships around Harper. And because the deal's average annual value is $25.4 million, it gets flexibility to spend more in coming offseasons and not run the risk of exceeding the luxury-tax threshold. In other words: Yes, an outfield with Harper and Philadelphia-area native Mike Trout is realistic.
With Bryce Harper headed to Philadelphia, this is what the Phillies lineup could look like this season:
LF Andrew McCutchen
SS Jean Segura
RF Bryce Harper
C J.T. Realmuto
1B Rhys Hoskins
CF Odubel Herrera
3B Maikel Franco
2B Cesar Hernandez
Pitcher
Harper wins by not just becoming the highest-paid team-sports athlete in history but by getting to spend 81 games a year in a stadium perfectly suited for him. While Harper possesses power to all fields, the vast majority of his 184 career home runs have gone to his pull side, and Citizens Bank Park's right-center power alley is 369 feet and its right-field line 330 feet. His legacy is only one-third written, and the rest of it is primed to include balls flying into the second and third decks in Philadelphia.
Harper could have gone to San Francisco -- its willingness to give him a double-digit-year deal convincing the Phillies they weren't bidding against themselves -- or Los Angeles, where the Dodgers were ready to offer him a record average annual value and the ability to opt out after perhaps two years. Harper could have easily exceeded Zack Greinke's record $34.4 million average annual value on a short-term deal and had another bite at the free-agent apple before he hit 30 years old.

Right or wrong, that didn't appeal to Harper. It didn't matter that he was coming off a season in which his pedestrian outfield defense sunk his wins above replacement and had the opportunity to play a couple of years for an excellent Dodgers team, opt out, enter free agency again coming off a better season and hit an even bigger bonanza of a deal. He desired security and what came with it.
For now, he holds the title of Biggest Deal Ever. He'll get $30 million this year ($20 million of it in a signing bonus), $26 million for the nine years after that and $22 million for the final three seasons. His grasp on the record could be short-lived if the Los Angeles Angels endeavor to keep Trout from reaching free agency following the 2020 season. Exceeding the $325 million deal Giancarlo Stanton signed in 2014 mattered enough that Harper was willing to miss nearly three weeks of spring training to ensure it happened.
With the long wait for Bryce Harper to sign over and the superstar winding up with the Phillies, social media went wild.
Bryce Harper has finally found his new baseball home, signing with the Phillies. What should fantasy managers expect now that the young star is signed up to play at Citizens Bank Park?
Bryce Harper can be as dynamic as baseball gets, but it hasn't always gone smoothly for him. Here's a look at his road to one of the game's biggest contracts.
At the same time, the notion of dedication, of loyalty, of all things familial came up often enough during his meetings with teams that they had to take it seriously. It was the Harpers' way of saying that this pledge was ironclad.
Which, for now, it is. Harper will be all smiles at his media conference. Phillies officials will beam. The first day is always happily ever after. They'll do everything shy of smearing cake frosting on each other's noses. Then comes the hard part. A marriage between star and team isn't easy, and it's especially difficult when that star happens to be guaranteed $330 million in a market that does not suffer failure gladly.
At some point, the bond will be tested and the vow questioned, because no relationship can be perfect. And when that happens, both sides will remember that the old chestnut -- you can't choose your family -- doesn't apply to baseball. Bryce Harper chose his. And he can only hope it was for the right reasons.

Kapler tweeted Friday that two of Vecere's friends contacted him with the news of Vecere's death and told him that Vecere was traveling to Kenya for the United Nations Environment Assembly.
""Matt was passionate about getting air and water filters to underprivileged communities and had a particular love for Haiti after doing work there over many years,"" Kapler wrote.
Now living in Long Beach, California, Vecere, 43, was born and raised in Sea Isle City, New Jersey, according to Philadelphia's WPVI-TV.
Matt Vecere, 43 died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Today's story is about how he LIVED. He volunteered with the elderly, homeless and hungry both locally and abroad.  Friends say his message would be for others to get up and help in any way possible. @6abc pic.twitter.com/yqJ1ceiRtN
The Los Angeles Times reported that Vecere went to Haiti often to distribute water and air filters and to help residents recover from the 2010 earthquake. The Time said he also flew to Northern California to help those relocated to shelters by the Camp Fire that destroyed numerous homes.
He also traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border hoping to help migrants, the Times reported.
Learning of Vecere's service to others is why Kapler wants Phillies fans to follow suit.
""To honor Matt, I'm asking that you consider doing something for a cause Matt cared about. His mother described those as ""the environment, civil rights, social and environmental justice, and advocating for those less fortunate.""

26256215,"""I'm frustrated,"" Heaney said, ""but it's something we just have to take care of now.""
Heaney was originally scratched from his March 3 start because of elbow inflammation but was cleared to resume throwing. He pitched again Friday, recording the first two outs against the Chicago White Sox, but informed the team that he was continuing to feel discomfort and was promptly shut down.
Heaney seemed to deal with a similar ailment last spring, but he was able to make his 2018 debut on April 13 and remained healthy throughout the season, posting a 4.15 ERA, a 1.20 WHIP and a 4.00 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 180 innings.
The Angels haven't made a decision on whether Heaney will start the season on the injured list, but Ausmus said they are ""getting close to having to.""

26273910,"""I think he's going to miss a significant amount of time,"" manager Dave Martinez said Friday.
Taylor favored his left leg as he limped through the clubhouse earlier in the day before heading to undergo an MRI.
""He's a big part of our ballclub,"" Martinez said after getting test results. ""So I just hope that he recovers quickly, and we can get him back out there as soon as possible.""
The Rookie of the Year runner-up put up historic numbers as a teenager. Now 20, he's the new heart of the Nats' lineup -- and drawing comparisons not just to his former teammate but also to Mike Trout.
Taylor had been set to enter the season as one of Washington's top four outfielders; it appeared he was going to be the first one off the bench, behind starters Adam Eaton in right, Juan Soto in left and rookie Victor Robles in center.
Robles and Taylor are the only true center fielders available to Martinez, who acknowledged Friday, ""You're correct: There's no outfield depth,"" after a reporter brought up the issue.
Bryce Harper, of course, has departed for the Philadelphia Phillies, a year after another starter, Jayson Werth, left the Nationals. The club traded two backups last season, and while Eaton is a veteran starter, Soto was an unexpected revelation at 19 last season, and Robles appears ready to make an impact at 21, Taylor was the only other sure thing in the outfield.
Taylor said his knee and hip stiffened shortly after he made a diving catch in center during the second inning of Washington's 10-4 victory over Minnesota on Thursday.
""I went to slide, and the outfield was a little soft, and my knee stuck in the ground,"" Taylor said.
In the moment, Martinez said, ""It was kind of scary. I ran out of the dugout right away, because it didn't look too good.""
Now Andrew Stevenson will see time in center field, and the team could look for other options.
""When you start a season with just four outfielders, you want a guy who can play center field,"" Martinez said. ""So we're going to have to really look for that guy.""
Matt Adams, a backup first baseman, started Washington's 11-3 win against the New York Mets on Friday. Of the more than 470 starts Adams has made in his major league career, only 30 came in left.
Martinez said that Wilmer Difo, a backup infielder, also will see time in the outfield in the coming days.
Another utility player who can play in the outfield, Howie Kendrick, is working his way back after straining his left hamstring in a game March 5. Martinez said Kendrick is not yet running at full speed.
Game notes
Newly signed LHP Tony Sipp said he's been throwing two bullpen sessions a week since January. ""But,"" the reliever added, ""still always different when you get a batter in the box. I haven't thrown to live batters. The arm is ready. Just kicking it into the next gear is going to be a challenge here in the next two weeks."" Washington opens the regular season March 28. Sipp threw a side session of 35 pitches Thursday, and Martinez said: ""My biggest thing with him -- and I talked to him yesterday -- is: 'As much as we want you for Opening Day, you missed significant time in spring training, so hopefully you're ready. But if you're not, you're not. But we want you to be fully ready, so if it takes you an extra three or four appearances down here, so be it.""

Roberts on Friday refused to officially rule him out for the opener, but for the first time this spring, he admitted that there's a strong possibility that his longtime ace won't be ready to face Arizona come March 28.
Corey Seager played shortstop in a game for the first time since April 29, logging three innings for the Los Angeles Dodgers in a minor league exhibition.
""It's unlikely,"" Roberts said. ""Unlikely is fair. But I don't want to close the door, but it's more, obviously, when you look at the calendar, it's more unlikely.""
Kershaw has thrown two bullpen sessions, including a 31-pitch one to Russell Martin on Thursday. He has been limited to throwing only fastballs so far, staying away from anything off-speed, which are his most effective pitches. The veteran lefty is scheduled to throw a third bullpen Monday.
Kershaw has made a Dodgers-record eight consecutive Opening Day starts. Asked earlier this week if making a ninth straight mattered to him, he said, ""Yes and no.""
Yes, because he would like to keep his streak active. No, because he understands the importance of avoiding further setbacks.
Kershaw turns 31 next week.

Fulmer was the 2016 AL Rookie of the Year and an All-Star in 2017. A right-hander who turns 26 on March 15, Fulmer was 3-12 with a 4.69 ERA in 132 1/3 innings last year. He didn't pitch for the Tigers between July 14 and Aug. 24 because of a left oblique strain, then didn't pitch after Sept. 15 because of a torn right lateral meniscus.
Players had a winning record for the third time in four years, but just the fifth time since 1996 and the 11th time since arbitration started in 1974.
Three starting pitchers won -- Cleveland's Trevor Bauer, Houston's Gerrit Cole and Cincinnati's Alex Wood -- along with Astros shortstop Carlos Correa, Oakland closer Blake Treinen and Tampa Bay outfielder Tommy Pham.
Players who lost included Washington outfielder Michael Taylor, Nationals reliever Kyle Barraclough and Toronto reliever Ryan Tepera.
Among the more than 175 players who were eligible for arbitration this year, just three agreed to contracts of more than one guaranteed season -- Yankees right-hander Luis Severino ($40 million for four years), Philadelphia right-hander Aaron Nola ($45 million for four years) and Minnesota outfielder Max Kepler ($35 million for five years).
Arizona left-hander T.J. McFarland and Milwaukee catcher Manny Pina agreed to contracts that included 2020 club options.

26084923,"Nolan Arenado and the Colorado Rockies have agreed to an eight-year contract, the team announced Tuesday night.
The contract is worth $260 million, locking up the star third baseman with a deal that could last through the 2026 season, league sources told ESPN.
The deal, which replaces Arenado's previous one-year contract, includes a full no-trade clause, according to sources.
After months of discussions, the agreement came together in recent days after the Rockies guaranteed an eighth season, according to sources. The deal, which will keep Arenado from reaching free agency after the 2019 season, will set a per-year record for position players. It also includes a player opt-out after the 2021 season.
All long-term deals carry risk, but Colorado and Arenado are the perfect storm of a franchise in win-now mode committing to a superstar cashing in at the right time.
Arenado, 27, is a four-time All-Star who has won a Gold Glove in all six of his major league seasons. He has led the National League in home runs three times, including 2018, when he hit .297/.374/.561 with 38 home runs and 110 RBIs.
While numerous teams were giddy at the idea of pursuing Arenado in free agency after the 2019 season, according to sources, he opted for the security of more than a quarter-billion dollars guaranteed by the Rockies. One of those teams was the Los Angeles Dodgers, who could step up their pursuit of current free agent Bryce Harper, with whom they met in Las Vegas on Sunday night, according to sources. The Dodgers are seeking a shorter-term deal than the decade-plus-long contract Harper is seeking.
Nolan Arenado has been one of baseball's elite power bats and run producers over the past few seasons. He's also the only player to have won a Gold Glove in each of the past six seasons.
The overall value of Arenado's deal fell short of the $300 million that free-agent third baseman Manny Machado received from the San Diego Padres, but it topped Machado's $30 million annual salary, as well as the $31 million Miguel Cabrera receives each year from the Detroit Tigers. Only Arizona Diamondbacks starter Zack Greinke, at $34.4 million, will have a higher average annual salary than Arenado's $32.5 million.
Over his first six seasons with Colorado, Arenado has hit .291/.346/.539 with 186 home runs and 616 RBIs -- both tops among NL players. His glove is widely regarded as even better than his bat, with highlight-reel plays practically a nightly occurrence.

26011712,"Ozuna underwent offseason shoulder surgery and is still in the rehabilitation process.
""Just making sure that he's being stretched out, healthy and moving forward,"" Shildt said. ""But his program has been nothing but positive feedback, has been great, and he's feeling good.""
St. Louis acquired Ozuna in a trade with Miami before the 2018 season. He had 37 homers and 124 RBI in 2017. Hampered by a lingering shoulder injury, Ozuna hit .280 with 23 homers and 88 RBI for St. Louis last season.
Ozuna will serve mostly as a designated hitter once Grapefruit League play begins. He'll be eased back into left field as the spring schedule progresses.
Shildt isn't at all worried that the slugger won't be ready when the Cardinals open the season at Milwaukee on March 28.
""Hasn't caused me [to lose] a wink of sleep,"" Shildt said.
St. Louis is showing similar caution with catcher Yadier Molina, who underwent offseason knee surgery. Molina isn't catching in the bullpen and probably won't appear behind the plate until a couple weeks into Grapefruit League play.
Like Ozuna, Molina will likely DH for the first few weeks of spring games.
"
26034151,"In the end, after weeks of consternation and grumbling and one prominent player suggesting the free-agent freeze could lead to a midseason player strike, Manny Machado received a contract commensurate with predictions at the start of the offseason: 10 years and $300 million.
That the deal is with the San Diego Padres feels only like a mild surprise at this point, given the various reports and rumors the past three-plus months. While it's not the record contract that agent Dan Lozano might have desired -- Giancarlo Stanton signed a 13-year, $325 million extension with the Marlins after the 2014 season -- it is the largest free-agent contract in the history of American sports.
Can Bryce Harper beat it?
Manny Machado is headed to the Padres on the richest deal ever signed by a free agent. Here's what to make of the $300 million contract. Winners and losers
• Doolittle: Why the deal makes sense
• Law: Machado accelerates Padres
• Schoenfield: Fallout for Bryce, baseball
• Fantasy impact | Machado timeline
With Machado off the big dartboard of free agency, Harper now holds the cards. Teams that wanted Machado or Harper now have just one option. Reports suggested that Lozano and Scott Boras were in a bit of a staring contest, waiting for the other player to sign first and thus potentially pushing the jilted teams -- we mean you, Philadelphia Phillies -- to a more desperate, higher bid.
Of course, one of the teams willing to pay $300 million is now off the board as well -- it would seem inconceivable that one team would spend $600 million on two free agents in one offseason -- so at the minimum, Harper has one fewer team bidding for his services than Machado did.
But it only takes one.
Let's look at the potential ripple effects of the Machado agreement:
Phillies' desperation increases: The offseason began with Phillies managing partner John Middleton saying, ""We're going into this expecting to spend money. And maybe even be a little bit stupid about it."" They remain the one team publicly connected to Machado and Harper throughout the winter, although it's not clear whether they've made a formal offer to Harper. Various reports also have suggested that the Phillies preferred Machado over Harper, viewing third base as a bigger hole over outfield, especially after signing free agent Andrew McCutchen to a three-year deal.
At Spectrum Field in Clearwater, Florida, Phillies GM Matt Klentak told reporters upon hearing of the Machado deal, ""If the reports are true, then this contract will exceed our valuation, and sometimes you have to be willing to walk away. We made our bid, put our best foot forward and he ended up signing with the Padres.""
So what is their valuation of Harper?
What we also don't know: Does Harper even want to play in Philadelphia? Leaving one successful NL East team where he has spent his entire career and has a comfort level for another NL East team that has been less successful (although on the upswing) would be a curious move, especially if the Nationals are still interested in bringing him back (and offering similar money). But the Nationals have spent a lot of money already this offseason, including Patrick Corbin's $140 million contract, and they project to have one of the best outfields in the game even without Harper.
Are the Giants serious about Harper? They're an aging team that had the worst offense in the majors in 2018. Chasing down the Dodgers over the next half-decade already looks like a daunting task for new president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi. Now he also has to deal with an up-and-coming Padres team that has Machado and the top-rated farm system in the majors. (And not to dismiss the Rockies, coming off two straight wild-card berths.)
Of note: Zaidi was part of the Dodgers' front-office regime that never gave out a $100 million contract to a free agent under Andrew Friedman. Does Zaidi agree with that line of thinking? Will the need for a power hitter in the outfield -- especially a 26-year-old in his prime -- overrule everything? The Giants are a big-market team that has drawn 3 million fans nine seasons in a row, but attendance did drop last year to its lowest total since 2009 in a second straight losing season. Bay Area fans might need a shiny, new toy to entice them to keep coming to newly renamed Oracle Park.
Again, however: Does Harper want to play in San Francisco and maybe the toughest home run park in the majors for a left-handed batter?
As Manny Machado's signing with the Padres sinks in, here are five facts about the deal that will blow your mind -- or, at the very least, impress your friends:
1. Machado's $300 million deal is the largest for a free agent in American sports history, surpassing A-Rod's 10-year, $275 million deal.
2. By adding Machado at $300 million after signing Eric Hosmer for $144 million last winter, the Padres have spent more on two players than they did in their previous 25 offseasons combined.
3. Machado was a free agent (113 days) longer than he was a Dodger (102 days).
4. Machado was an All-Star starter in 2018. Who was the last Padres position player to start a Midsummer Classic? That would be Tony Gwynn in 1998. (Though we should note that Wil Myers got the hometown start at DH in 2016.)
5. The Padres signed Machado on Feb. 19, 2019 -- one year to the day after they inked Hosmer.
The Yankees really aren't getting either of these guys: It's not impossible to see a fit for Harper -- he, Aaron Judge and Stanton could have a timeshare in the corner outfield and DH spots -- but Brian Cashman has declined to entertain questions about the Yankees' pursuit of the two players with specific answers, saying the other day, ""I would reinforce I'm doing my job. Whether that's those two or others."" Hmm.
Padres' down-the-road vision trumps the White Sox's: Well, maybe it was just a matter of cold, hard cash, but the White Sox, like the Padres, had to sell Machado on the future more than the present. If that was a factor, Machado chose the team with a slightly better current roster and the much deeper farm system. On the other hand, he also chose the team in the tougher division.
Would the White Sox be in play for Harper? Most speculate that they can't envision Jerry Reinsdorf going $300 million-plus for Harper. But he does have Machado's brother-in-law Yonder Alonso on the team.
Does all this amuse the Dodgers at all? The Dodgers sit out the Machado/Harper sweepstakes while the Padres, two hours to the south, snag one of the big stars. Hey, at least it makes the NL West a lot more interesting.
Will Harper top Machado's deal or Stanton's record? I'm not convinced this is certain to happen, especially after reading Klentak's remarks on Machado. While Machado comes attached with some character issues, Harper's on-field performance has been more inconsistent. He didn't have a great 2018, hitting .249/.393/.496 with terrible defense that dragged down his WAR to just 1.3. Harper could have made this whole process a lot easier with a better season. You know the analytics departments have been crunching the numbers to project how Harper will perform not just over 10 years, but even in the immediate future.
Harper has power and a good eye at the plate. One concern about his future is that he had a career-worst 31.4 swing-and-miss rate (compared to 26.8 percent in 2017 and 23.1 percent in 2016). Maybe he was pressing. He did have a much better second half, hitting .300/.434/.538 and cutting his miss rate to 28.6 percent. Bottom line: If the Phillies weren't willing to go $300 million on Machado, are they willing to go $300 million on Harper? And if they're not, which team will?
Even with the rise of new tactics like the opener, old-school aces are leading the way.
The big left-hander has said that the 2019 season will be his last, but it could help punch his ticket to Cooperstown.
From the free agents set to cash in to the big-name stars sure to come up in trade rumors all winter long, keep up with all of the latest action.
Does this mean all the kvetching over the free-agent signing slowdown will subside? Probably not. At Red Sox camp, when informed of Machado's deal, AL MVP Mookie Betts said, ""There's still a lot more guys out there, so it's kind of hard to say. One of the best closers in the game is still out there [referring to Craig Kimbrel], a young guy who is one of the best in the game, too [referring to Harper], so it's kind of tough to say if it's good, but I guess it's a step in the right direction.""
What does this deal mean for Betts, Nolan Arenado or Mike Trout? Arenado, a free agent after 2019, is discussing a long-term extension with the Rockies.
""I don't think [Machado] has too much of an effect on me. I'm not sure,"" Arenado said at Rockies camp. ""I just know that I'm happy he signed. I think it's really good for baseball, a well-deserved contract. We need these guys signed and we need these guys playing ball.""
Betts and Trout are free agents after 2020. Betts was likewise demure on how Machado's contract could affect his future.
""I mean, I think we're different players, so obviously it's going to be a different time,"" Betts said. ""I don't want to speak on anybody else's free agency. I've just got to worry about my own.""
At the beginning of the offseason, wild speculation was that Harper and Machado could receive $400 million contracts. That was never going to happen, with Harper coming off a shaky season and Machado's perceived character flaws. Arenado probably won't get there either, since he'll be entering his free agency at age 28 compared to 26 for Machado and Harper.
Betts and Trout, however? Stay tuned, my friends. We might get that $400 million deal in two years.

Fulmer won AL Rookie of the Year honors in 2016 but has struggled to return to that form. He was 3-12 with a 4.69 ERA last year, his season cut short in mid-September because of knee problems.

26089271,"Major League Baseball is prepared to scuttle the implementation of a pitch clock until at least 2022 as part of a wide-ranging proposal to the MLB Players Association that would include the ability to implement a three-batter-minimum rule for pitchers and roster-size changes in 2020, sources familiar with the plan told ESPN.
MLB also is proposing limitations on position players' usage as pitchers, getting rid of the waiver trading period, further cutting mound visits and potentially shortening inning breaks, sources said.
The proposal, sent by the league on Tuesday, is the latest in a back-and-forth bargaining session centered around the league's unilateral ability to implement a 20-second pitch clock. Amid tension between the parties stemming from a free-agent market that players have found unsatisfactory, the league, which is testing the pitch clock in spring training games, offered not to revisit the issue until after the 2021 expiration of the current collective bargaining agreement as part of a broader set of rule changes.
If MLB wants to speed up pace of play, it should. But as an olive branch, grandfather in veterans like Max Scherzer.
Three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer said he is ""fundamentally against"" having a pitch clock in baseball, saying, ""There's no clock in baseball for a reason.""
Major League Baseball will begin using the independent Atlantic League as a new testing ground for experimenting with playing rules and equipment during the season.
A number of the proposals from the league dovetail with past suggestions from the union, according to sources, lending credence to the notion that an agreement can be reached with minimal animus.
The most controversial aspect is the three-batter-minimum rule for pitchers. The desire to increase the pace and speed of games could be aided by the rule, which aims to end the carousel of relief pitchers that has become so commonplace late in games. Under the proposal, the league would have the right to implement the rule -- which has a caveat for injured pitchers -- in 2020.
That year, rosters also would be expanded by one to 26 players, with a maximum of 13 pitchers, according to sources. While the league's proposal includes a mandated 28-man roster with a 14-pitcher cap in September, the union has chafed at limiting roster sizes when teams currently can use as many as 40 players in the season's final month.
MLB took the union's suggestion of a single trade deadline before the All-Star break and countered by keeping the current July 31 deadline in place but eliminating trades in August for players who clear waivers, sources said. The league did, in the proposal, agree to abide by the union's suggestion for reduced mound visits -- from six to five in 2019 and five to four in 2020.
The use of position players as pitchers would have rules attached to it, sources said. Each player at the beginning of a season would be designated a pitcher or position player, except in cases where a player is deemed a two-way player (with 20 major league innings pitched and 20 starts at a position, including designated hitter, with at least three plate appearances). Position players could pitch only after the ninth inning or following the sixth inning in games in which their team trails by at least seven runs.
The league proposed having the right in 2019 to shorten inning breaks from 2 minutes, 5 seconds to 1 minute, 55 seconds in locally broadcast games, in addition to shaving 30 seconds off the current 2-minute, 25-second breaks in national games, according to sources. If agreed upon, the league would begin testing the change this spring before implementing it.
Also included is a joint study of the strike zone and mound height and distance, according to sources, another spot in which the parties' thinking coincides. MLB, in a partnership with the Atlantic League, plans on using the independent league this year to begin testing an automated strike zone and mound distance farther than 60 feet, 6 inches, according to a Baseball America report.
Other proposals by the league include:
Trying to avoid roster manipulation by switching the injured list for pitchers from 10 to 15 days and doing the same for days they must spend in the minor leagues when optioned.
Starting a runner on second base in the 10th inning of the All-Star Game and spring training games, and ending the latter in a tie after 10 innings.

26276898,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Houston Astros manager AJ Hinch called umpire Angel Hernandez ""unprofessional"" and ""arrogant"" after being ejected in the first inning of Friday night's split-squad game against St. Louis.
Hinch was tossed following one pitch in the bottom of the first inning.
""The fact that he wanted to throw me out in a spring training game is pretty ridiculous,"" Hinch said. ""He's known for overreaction a little bit.""
Hinch's postgame comments angered Hernandez.
""He said that? Write it,"" Hernandez said before adding, ""No comment. He got ejected for arguing balls and strikes. That's it.""
The argument could linger beyond spring training.
""I'm sure we'll revisit this in-season,"" Hinch said.
World Series, season win totals and player props -- there are more ways than ever to bet baseball. Here are our nine best futures bets for this season.
From top prospects and rising young stars to bounce-back candidates, which players who missed the MLB Rank cut could soon find a place on the list?
A major shake-up brings a new crew of All-Stars to the forefront, with some of the game's biggest names on the outside looking in.
Hinch said about a week ago Hernandez told him that he gets about four ball-strike calls wrong per game.
After a few of those calls didn't go Houston's way in the top of the first inning, Hinch said he calmly made a suggestion to Hernandez as the Astros prepared to bat.
""We have technology to help you get better and that these pitches are strikes,"" Hinch said he told Hernandez. ""He had kind of an arrogant attitude about it and didn't want to hear it.""
When Hernandez called the first pitch to Astros leadoff hitter George Springer a strike, Hinch said he thought Hernandez probably made the call out of spite.
From the dugout, Hinch said he yelled to Hernandez that he'd used up his allotment of missed calls, prompting the ejection.
Hinch emerged from the dugout and began a lengthy and at times heated conversation with Hernandez at home plate.
""When you argue balls and strikes you get thrown out, I get it,"" Hinch said. ""As it escalated, he said some condescending things that are inappropriate, unprofessional. I'll leave it at that and we'll move on to the next game.""
First-base umpire CB Bucknor attempted to intervene, but Hinch wouldn't leave the plate area for more than two minutes. At one point, Hernandez clapped his hands as if to say, ""Let's go, argument over.""
Hinch mockingly clapped back at him.
""I should thank CB. He was the voice of reason in all of it,"" Hinch said. ""CB was super calm about it, he just wanted the game to continue.""
As Hinch grew more agitated, he was restrained by both Springer and coach Alex Cintron. Hinch appeared to bump both Hernandez and Bucknor at least once each.
At one point during the argument, Cardinals starter Daniel Ponce de Leon elected to throw a warm-up pitch, doing so while Hinch stood in the right-handed batter's box, his back to the plate.
Hinch stopped to talk for several seconds with third-base umpire Mike Estabrook on his way down the left-field line to the Astros' clubhouse.
Hernandez came under scrutiny during the American League playoffs last year when he saw three calls at first base overturned by replay during a Red Sox-Yankees game in New York.
Hernandez, 57, joined the Major League Baseball umpiring staff in 1993.
Hinch said he considered making the 15-minute drive to Jupiter, where the other half of the Astros were playing a second split-squad game against the Cardinals.
""I didn't think about managing it, but I thought about showing up and shocking, the whole side of that,"" Hinch said.
The Astros side that Hinch had been managing won 5-0. The other squad of Astros beat St. Louis 11-2.

26222328,"A first-round pick of the Seattle Mariners in 2003, Jones was one of five players traded to the Baltimore Orioles in return for pitcher Erik Bedard in 2008. Since joining the Orioles, the 33-year-old outfielder has been named an All-Star five times and has won four Gold Gloves.
Known for his consistency and durability, Jones ranks among the Orioles' top 10 on several franchise leaderboards, including games (1,613, ninth), runs (875, seventh), hits (1,781, fifth), home runs (263, fifth) and RBIs (866, sixth).
In our spring MLB stock watch, we examine who gained (and lost) the most wins during the offseason with the biggest names finally off the market.
In 2018, Jones batted .281 in 145 games. His 15 home runs and 63 RBIs were his lowest totals in both categories since his first season in Baltimore in 2008. A center fielder for the majority of his career, Jones moved to right field in August after the rebuilding Orioles called up prospect Cedric Mullins.
In late July, Jones made headlines when he vetoed a trade that would have sent him to the Philadelphia Phillies.
A native of San Diego, Jones has established deep ties to the Mid-Atlantic region. An alumnus of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, he's developed a reputation for being one of MLB's most community-minded players, donating time and money to multiple organizations in and around Baltimore.
He also married the daughter of former Washington Redskins player and Baltimore native Jean Fugett, and recently purchased the home of former Orioles great Cal Ripken Jr.

26205574,"""I always will be the villain, no matter what,"" Machado told the New York Post in a story published Friday. ""I don't know why. That is just stuff I have to deal with, and I have been OK dealing with that situation. That doesn't bother me.""
The viewpoint on Machado has developed over the years, with a number of incidents during last year's postseason run with the Los Angeles Dodgers serving as examples. During the World Series, he stepped on Boston Red Sox first baseman Steve Pearce's heel while running through first base. A similar collision with the Milwaukee Brewers' Jesus Aguilar led to the benches clearing during the National League Championship Series.
An undeniable talent, Manny Machado also has been called out for dirty play and a bad attitude. Here's a look at what the Padres are getting into.
The San Diego Padres have generated nearly $3 million of additional ticket revenue in the two weeks since Manny Machado agreed to a 10-year, $300 million contract, according to the team's president of business operations Erik Greupner.
Machado has also been criticized for his comment in October that he is ""not the type of player that's going to be 'Johnny Hustle.'""
But Machado, who signed a 10-year, $300 million contract with the Padres, told the Post he will focus on baseball and not how he is received within and outside the sport.
""I'm going to play my game, and I am going to go down as the player I am,"" Machado said. ""I can't control what people think of me. I can't control any of that. I can only control what I do on the field. I can control how good of a teammate I am, how good of a baseball player I am. I am not going to say that I don't regret some of the things I have done.
""I have done some pretty dumb things. I am not going to lie. I see the things I have done, and I have done some dumb things. At the same time, I have done things that get blown out of the water, and suddenly I am that guy. At the end of the day, I play baseball, and I don't let anything else get in my head.""
Machado has previously referred to himself as a villain, after the then-Baltimore Oriole spiked the Red Sox's Dustin Pedroia on a slide and was thrown at by multiple Boston pitchers during an April 2017 series.
""I think everyone already knows out there that they think I'm the villain,"" he said at the time. ""It's always me -- 'Manny always does something wrong.' You know, it's never me. I just go out there and play a game that I love and leave it on the field.""
Machado also addressed his free-agency decision with the Post, acknowledging that the Padres weren't his first choice but adding that the team ""showed me the love"" in its recruitment.

The driver told police Dykstra held a gun to his head, though no weapon was found.
Dykstra's attorney, David Bahuriak, previously called the incident ""overblown"" and that his client was innocent.
Bahuriak had filed a motion to suppress evidence before the judge's ruling, saying that a police search of the man's belongings was improper and there were no witnesses to the alleged threat.
The judge granted the motion, telling Dykstra, ""I hope you have learned a lesson from this.""
The driver told NJ.com that it was important Dykstra entered a guilty plea. He said Dykstra has ""admitted to what he did in my car.""

26176210,"To avoid repeating his slow 2018 start, Hill took an aggressive offseason approach, including throwing three bullpens, before reporting to camp on Feb. 12. Consequently, he's already appeared in three Cactus League games, striking out seven, walking none, and posting a 1.42 ERA.
His performance Wednesday night against the Indians was typical: no runs, three hits, four strikeouts and no walks.
""I didn't have my best stuff, but I was able to manipulate my pitches the way I wanted to and change my delivery the way I wanted to and just pitch,"" Hill said.
The fourth-year Dodger, who turns 39 on Monday, has a 3.91 ERA over a 14-year career. In three of his five starts last April and May, he was hit hard and his ERA soared to 6.32, prompting a new approach.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said that, for now at least, Clayton Kershaw remains scheduled to start March 28 even though it seems unlikely based on the progress he would need to make in the next few weeks.
After an up-and-down 2018, Cody Bellinger is refining his swing to re-establish himself as an everyday force in the Dodgers' lineup.
""You want to get as deep as you can before games actually start counting,"" he said. ""A lot of time you want to say, `We have time in spring training.' But really, we don't. Spring training is almost over, if you look at the calendar. We've gotta get really ramped up and focused for the 2019 season.""
With the possibility that ace Clayton Kershaw will not be ready for the March 28 season opener because of shoulder soreness that stalled his progression and the ""slow play"" of Walker Buehler in deference to protecting his young arm, Hill might initially end up at the top of the rotation.
""The decision isn't up to me, so hopefully, all those guys get back and are healthy because like I said, the season's right around the corner and we need to get off to a good start,"" he said.
Hill played catch with Kershaw on Tuesday and saw Buehler's bullpen on Wednesday.
""Walker looked great. And I know Clayton is making really good strides, so there's a lot of positive stuff going on,"" he said.
When asked about the situation Thursday, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said, ""For both of those guys, we're not worried about opening day. We are worried about getting those guys ramped up. When the time comes, we'll see where we're at. So, to speculate right now, it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.""
Catcher Austin Barnes believes Hill is already in peak form.
""I think it is the same really, his fastball and curveball have the same characteristics,"" Barnes said. ""His energy and the way he competes is a little bit different from everybody.""
Game notes
Kershaw threw with closer Kenley Jansen on Thursday morning, demonstrating an ability to throw on consecutive days as he progresses from the shoulder soreness that shut him down earlier in camp. Kershaw moved back to approximately 130 feet, from which he lofted crow hopped throws, before gradually moving closer to Jansen with increased velocity. Kershaw also threw from a pitching distance to a crouching catcher. Kershaw has declined to discuss his shoulder or his pitching. ... SS Corey Seager stayed home from camp for the second consecutive day because of an illness and missed his first planned appearance in a minor league exhibition. Seager is working his way back from Tommy John surgery and arthroscopic hip surgery. ... There is no update on a timeline for the arrival of OF Andrew Toles, who is indefinitely absent from camp for personal reasons. ... LHP Donnie Hart was claimed off waivers from Baltimore and RHP Josh Fields was designated for assignment.

26093789,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Nolan Arenado says he wants to spend his entire major league career with the Colorado Rockies and had no desire to become a free agent after this season.
""At the end of the day my heart was here,"" he said Wednesday, a day after agreeing to an eight-year, $260 million contract.
Arenado's deal has a $32.5 million average annual value, second behind the $34.42 million for pitcher Zack Greinke in a $206.5 million contract with Arizona that began in 2016.
All long-term deals carry risk, but Colorado and Arenado are the perfect storm of a franchise in win-now mode committing to a superstar cashing in at the right time.
It appears there will be even more free agents next fall than there were this winter. And the upper echelon of stars is strong.
Arenado has a full no-trade provision.
He said he wants to emulate Colorado's Todd Helton and former New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter by spending his entire big league career with one team.
Arenado says the cold free-agent market the past two seasons wasn't a big factor but ""obviously it's in your head.""
Manny Machado waited until last week before getting a 10-year deal, $300 million with San Diego, and Bryce Harper remains on the market.
""I don't go off what everyone else is doing. I never have,"" Arenado said.
He agreed in January to a one-year, $26 million contract with the Rockies. His new deal keeps that salary, calls for $35 million annually from 2020 to 2024, $32 million in 2025 and $27 million in 2026. He must decide after the 2021 season whether to opt in for the remainder of the contract.
He can earn an additional $25,000 each time he is an All-Star or wins a Gold Glove, $50,000 for Silver Slugger award, $75,000 for league championship series MVP, $75,000 for World Series MVP, $100,000 for MVP and $50,000 for second through fifth in the voting, and $100,000 for comeback player of the year.

26264621,"A 31-year-old right-hander, Chacin was 15-8 with a 3.50 ERA in 35 starts last season. He also started openers for Colorado in 2013 and San Diego in 2017.
""Jhoulys earned the honor from what he did last year and he deserves it for sure,"" Brewers manager Craig Counsell said Thursday.
Chacin allowed one run and one hit over 5 2/3 innings in the NL Central tiebreaker game against the Chicago Cubs and pitched five shutout innings in a Division Series start against Colorado. He went 1-1 with a 2.45 ERA in two starts against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series.

26273490,"Cashman told reporters at the Yankees' spring training facility in Tampa, Florida, that it was unlikely Severino would be ready to pitch in a game before May 1 because of the rotator cuff inflammation that flared up in his right shoulder just before a start two weeks ago. Originally, the Yankees had hoped he might be able to rejoin the rotation by mid-April after being shut down for two weeks and beginning a series of anti-inflammatories and receiving a cortisone injection.
""His competition, for me, is in the monuments,"" Yankees legend Reggie Jackson said.
The outfield prospect has fallen a notch or two in the minds of some experts. But the Yankees are still seeing signs of his potential this spring.
For a pitcher as accomplished as Keuchel, there will always be interest. But time -- and his lack of velocity -- isn't on his side.
Severino is just beyond the halfway point of that two-week shutdown period. He told reporters Friday that his expectation is to resume a throwing program sometime next week.
The rotator cuff became inflamed minutes before a March 5 start at George M. Steinbrenner Field against the Atlanta Braves. After throwing a series of fastballs during his warm-up, the right-hander attempted to throw a slider. When he did, he felt what he described as a ""pull"" in his shoulder and immediately sought medical attention.
Cashman also said Friday that he expects veteran CC Sabathia to return to the rotation in mid-to-late April, as he finishes his rehab from offseason knee surgery and an unexpected heart procedure.
Until Severino and Sabathia return, the Yankees likely will turn to young pitchers such as Domingo German, Luis Cessa and Jonathan Loaisiga to help fill the void. Cessa has been particularly impressive this spring, boasting a 0.69 ERA in four starts. In 13 innings, the 26-year-old has 13 strikeouts and has allowed seven hits and just one run.
Cashman also expressed pessimism that center fielder Aaron Hicks would be ready for Opening Day on March 28. Hicks has spent much of spring training fighting through a lower-back injury. He said earlier this week that he expects to be healthy by Opening Day, but Cashman said he isn't sure if the outfielder will have had enough spring training at-bats to impact the club at that point.

26195806,"The 25-year-old third baseman had planned to have surgery on his right thumb after the season ended, but he also ended up getting an operation on his left shoulder in December. Both injuries had been bothering Chapman for a while.
""The shoulder was kind of a fluke thing, but it was hurting me the last couple years,"" Chapman said. ""Just overuse. ... I didn't really think it was anything besides just being sore.""
Now he's ready to build on a year in which he hit 24 homers, won a Gold Glove and finished seventh in AL MVP voting.
His preparation has been compressed because of the surgeries and Oakland's early start to spring training and the regular season. The A's will travel to Japan to play the Seattle Mariners in the season-opening series on March 20-21.
""I think he's right on schedule,"" Oakland manager Bob Melvin said Friday. ""We maybe got him in there a day earlier than we expected. He's running up close to 20 at-bats, which I didn't think we'd have right now. I think everything's going great with him.""
Chapman has been to the plate 16 times this spring, with four walks and four hits including a double and a home run.
""Just getting more and more healthy and strong each day,"" he said. ""No excuses now.""
The A's won a surprising 97 games last year even with injuries to their entire starting rotation. Now they're aiming even higher.
""Hopefully continue to build on what we did last year,"" Chapman said. ""One hundred wins. Win the division. If your goals going into the season aren't to win your division or make the playoffs, then what are you playing for?""
Chapman thinks his defense can improve even after he won the Gold Glove and the Platinum Glove, given to the best overall fielder in the AL. He made 20 errors last season and wants to reduce that number.
His defensive prowess invites comparisons to the NL Gold Glove third baseman, Nolan Arenado, who was just rewarded by the Colorado Rockies with an eight-year, $260 million deal.
""He obviously deserves that. He's also (would have been) a free agent at 27, I'm gonna be 30. It's a little different,"" Chapman said. ""That's far in the future for me, but I'm off to a good start.""

LF Khris Davis (left calf strain) made his Cactus League debut on Friday. Davis, who has appeared in minor-league games this spring, was the designated hitter and batted cleanup. Facing San Diego prospect Chris Paddack, Davis struck out swinging on a 95-mph fastball in the first inning and flied to deep center in the fourth. Davis led the majors with 48 homers last season and drove in a career-high 123 runs. ... A's catcher Chris Herrmann underwent surgery on his right knee on Friday, Melvin said. The manager said there's no timetable for his return.

Sources said Maldonado could make another $1.4 million in incentives. The Athletic first reported the agreement, which is pending a physical.
Maldonado hit .225 with nine home runs and 44 RBIs for the Los Angeles Angels and Houston Astros last season. His biggest strength is his ability to frame pitches and play defense, and his experience should help what is expected to be a young Royals team this season. Maldonado's Gold Glove in 2017 broke Perez's streak of four straight.
Cam Gallagher and Meibrys Viloria are the other catchers currently on Kansas City's 40-man roster. Gallagher, who appeared in 35 games during the past two years, has a .218 career average with two home runs and 12 RBIs. Viloria, 22, was a September call-up last season and has appeared in only three major league games.
The Royals are also trying first baseman Frank Schwindel behind the plate. Schwindel played catcher in college at St. John's and early in his minor league career, but he has been stuck behind other prospects at first base.
A career .220 hitter, Maldonado started in the majors with six seasons in Milwaukee.

The left-hander finished 12-8 with a 4.18 ERA in 28 starts for the Rangers last season, his first with the team.
He signed a three-year contract with Rangers after the 2017 season when he pitched exclusively in relief for the Kansas City Royals, finishing with a 2.55 ERA in 65 appearances. He began his career as a starter with the Atlanta Braves, going 38-36 in 110 starts from 2010-14 but had shoulder surgery in 2015 and didn't pitch that season or in 2016.

26019145,"The Athletic was first to report the agreement.
The left-handed-hitting Moustakas batted .251 with 28 homers and 95 RBIs in 152 games in 2018 with the Kansas City Royals and Brewers. He hit .256 with eight homers and 33 RBIs with the Brewers after being acquired from the last-place Royals on July 27 and helped bolster Milwaukee for its NL Central-winning stretch run.
Moustakas became a big hit with both fans and teammates on the Brewers in their drive to come within one game of reaching the World Series. They appreciated his solid third base defense, and his left-handed power stroke was key in getting Milwaukee through the NL Division Series. In the clubhouse, his focused demeanor and extensive postseason experience made him a source of steadiness for a club playing in the postseason for the first time since 2011.
Reigning NL MVP Christian Yelich expressed his excitement over Moustakas returning to the Brew Crew.

Moustakas was instrumental in helping Kansas City reach the World Series twice, including its championship run in 2015, and brought that pivotal playoff experience to bear as another key, power-hitting presence in the Milwaukee lineup.
Moustakas hit .364 in a three-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies in the NLDS with two RBIs. He had a game-ending, two-out RBI single in the 10th inning in Game 1 and an RBI single in the eighth inning of Game 2 to help break open what had been a 1-0 game.
Overall, the 30-year-old Moustakas has hit .217 with six homers and 18 RBIs in 41 games over nine postseason series.
The playoff run in Milwaukee wound down an eventful year for Moustakas that started with a disappointing offseason.
After setting the Royals' single-season home run record with 38 in 2017 and being named AL Comeback Player of the Year, Moustakas filed for free agency. He rejected a $17.4 million qualifying offer in November 2017.
Moustakas never received the multiyear mega-contract he and his agent, Scott Boras, had anticipated. The Royals signed Moustakas to a one-year, $6.5 million contract in March with a mutual option for 2019.
""It's definitely been an interesting year, but I'm very happy with the way everything turned out,"" Moustakas said in October. ""I was able to sign back with Kansas City. I got traded here and now I'm in the postseason again. Everything happens for a reason.""

26196748,"Kelly felt tightness in his back on Wednesday. Roberts said Kelly told him he hurt his back when he stood too long cooking Cajun food.
Roberts said the injury was not expected to be serious.
In December, the team signed the reliever, who spent the last four seasons with the Boston Red Sox, to a three-year, $25 million free-agent contract.
He has made two appearances. In his debut, he allowed two walks, two hits and one run in an inning, but on March 3 allowed just one hit in a scoreless inning against the Texas Rangers.

The ace left-hander had announced on Friday that he was taking a step back from throwing, but didn't provide a specific reason. On Sunday, Roberts told reporters it was because of inflammation in Kershaw's throwing shoulder. He also said that Kershaw would play catch on Monday, but didn't specify how much he'd throw or at what distance he would throw from.
The Dodgers have re-entered the Bryce Harper sweepstakes after meeting with the free-agent slugger Sunday in his hometown of Las Vegas.
The Phillies absolutely want Harper. But does he want them? It's time for a final answer.
With a new team and a contract to play for, the always-entertaining outfielder says he's ready to show the Dodgers -- and everyone else -- all he can do.
Robert said the results of Monday's session were concerning.
""It's not ideal,"" he said. ""You're hoping when he picks up a ball that he comes out of it feeling better. So obviously it's not ideal. But we'll deal with whatever comes our way.""
Roberts said there were still no plans for testing.
""We'll get together with the training staff and come up with a course of action for Clayton,"" he said. ""But right now, we don't have an MRI scheduled.""
Kershaw, 30, had a 2.73 ERA and a 1.04 WHIP last season. But his fastball velocity dropped to the low 90s, and his slider began to take on the characteristics of a cutter, giving Kershaw little differentiation outside of the rare times he threw his curveball. It prompted the lowest strikeout rate (8.6) and highest hit rate (7.8) since his rookie season in 2008.
The day he signed a three-year extension to remain with the Dodgers in early November -- a deal that basically tacked on an extra season to the contract he had opted out of -- Kershaw expressed his desire to ""prove a lot of people wrong"" and tap back into some of his velocity.
The three-time Cy Young Award winner then spent most of the offseason in Dallas trying to increase his flexibility and realign his delivery. He was noticeably less bullish when speaking to reporters about his previous desire to add velocity at the onset of camp, saying, ""I think I was just fired up. I guess it just sounded good.""
Information from ESPN's Alden Gonzalez was used in this report.
"
26242953,"""According to the MRI, it was barely noticeable,"" manager Joe Maddon said on Tuesday. ""So we don't think it's going to be anything horribly long but we don't know for sure. We'd like to think we'll be able to get him ready for the beginning of the season.""
Strop, 33, has no doubt.
""I'll be ready for Day 1, 100 percent,"" he said Wednesday. ""I'm not even limited in doing anything.""
Strop is the Cubs' de facto closer as Brandon Morrow is on the mend after minor elbow surgery this past winter.
The team stressed the injury to Strop was minor enough that he can keep throwing, but the Cubs won't risk him causing more damage to himself in a game.
Strop injured his left hamstring late last season while running to first on a ground ball during a rare plate appearance.
He saved 13 games last year, in place of Morrow, who missed the entire second half. Morrow is expected to miss the first month of this season and if Strop is out as well, the Cubs are likely to turn to Carl Edwards Jr, Steve Cishek and Brandon Kintzler to close games. The latter two have ninth-inning experience.

26230118,"His energy never quit, but his bat and glove betrayed him as he dropped off both on offense and behind the plate. His second-half demise in 2018 mirrored his team's -- but now both are on the comeback trail. Contreras is out to prove that he is every bit the All-Star who was voted a starter just last season.
""I'm going to do my work and let what you see speak for myself,"" Contreras said recently at Cubs camp while wearing a T-shirt with the words ""DON'T BELIEVE ME JUST WATCH."" ""I reflected a lot about last year. I never got really down. I did my best to help, but now I need to do better.""
Contreras' three-year arc in the big leagues tells a story of regression. For some, it makes little sense. Others see his emotions getting the best of him while he plays a position that calls for poise and maturity.

""We forget that he was thrust into a situation in 2016 that not any catcher ever had to endure,"" Cubs catching coach Mike Borzello said. ""Showing up late in the season, being asked to catch what turned out to be a world championship pitching staff ... Once that happened, I think the assumption was, 'He's here. He's polished. He's ready to go.'""
It certainly looked that way. Playing with boundless energy, Contreras ranked fourth in OPS among catchers that season, including a .972 mark against fastballs. By 2018, that number plummeted to .682 off fastballs, which included a .192 batting average. The dip versus off-speed pitches was similar, and Contreras lost much of his power. He hit 11 fewer home runs (10 overall) in 2018 than the season before, in about 100 more at-bats. His offense simply fell apart. But why? Borzello has a theory.
""He put so much focus on his defense, it may have had an effect on his offense,"" he said. ""You never hear that. It's always the other way around. In my opinion, it did last year.""
Borzello could be onto something for one simple reason. A catcher used to be judged on his arm and, secondarily, perhaps on his blocking ability. But in today's game, pitch framing seems to be cited more often than caught stealing percentages when assessing a catcher. Contreras shouldn't be concerned with the latter stat, considering he has a cannon for an arm, but stealing a strike or two for his pitchers hasn't been his forte. The Cubs know he's well aware of it and think it has been on his mind too much.
""He knows that's a category that's analyzed a lot,"" Borzello said. ""Maybe the most. We're constantly trying things to get better.""
In his first exclusive interview since joining the Phillies, Bryce Harper goes deep on rejecting $300 million, recruiting Mike Trout and playing in Philly for life. Tim Keown
Like a lot of Contreras' game after his rookie season, his pitch framing has dropped to the bottom of the league. In 2017, he ranked 49th out of 54 catchers (minimum 50 games). Last season, he ranked 45th out of 51. Perhaps improving there will spill over to his offense, as Contreras is committed to being better. He even sought advice from his younger brother, a catcher in the Braves organization.
""I used to stick my glove out all the way,"" Contreras said. ""Now I'm going to show the target, but I'm going to quarter-turn it a little bit. That way my hand gets relaxed, and I have a rhythm behind the plate. I was too stiff. He talked about that, and he was right.""
Borzello echoed that notion, pointing out the Cubs have been trying to get Contreras to alter his style slightly since he came up.
""It gives you some sort of rhythm,"" Borzello said. ""Instead of catching from a dead standstill, you have some sort of movement and rhythm to the ball. It also frees up your hand on your left side. So it gives you some freedom there as well.""
It's such a subtle move -- his pitchers haven't even noticed it -- but they've noticed a more committed-than-ever catcher.
""He told me he was working on something real small,"" Kyle Hendricks said. ""I haven't really noticed it. ... [He's] determined. Renewed focus. He's always locked in and brings the energy every day.""
ESPN's Buster Olney leads the discussion of the latest news and notes around baseball with the game's top analysts. Listen
There's little doubt that Contreras' energy helped vault him to the majors as a converted infielder back in 2016. He is a fist-waving, loud player when he's involved in tense moments -- and that has served him well. But there are drawbacks. Some scouts who have watched his career believe that actually has held him back. He hasn't always had a loving relationship with umpires, either.
If there is a correlation between energy and running the bases, that has worked against Contreras instead of for him. According to FanGraphs, he has been among the Cubs' three worst baserunners every year of his career. He was second-worst on the team in 2018, with a minus-5 in the FanGraphs baserunning metric (which translates somewhere between poor and awful). But the new year has brought a new attitude. Borzello says he's seeing changes already this spring.
""Controlling his personality, effort level and all that stuff has improved,"" Borzello said. ""We've seen it in this camp so far. Now we have to see it when the lights go on.""
As Contreras attempts to separate his offense from his defense, and vice versa, everyone knows that the quickest way for a player to gain confidence is a hot start at the plate. Stats don't matter in March, but good habits do. Contreras' Cactus League batting average (currently .389) and two home runs will be quickly forgotten next month, but the Cubs are hoping the changes to his approach will stick.
""I've been watching him close,"" manager Joe Maddon said. ""What he's doing at the plate is not an accident. He's doing something differently, in a good way.
""I think it's sustainable, whether it's spring training or not. That's my impression. Now I want to see it against 93, 94 or 95 miles per hour.""
It sounds like Maddon is aware of the precipitous drop in production Contreras has experienced against fastballs and knows that one of the changes he's making might address it. Again, it's a subtle move but potentially a big one.
Leading off our countdown of the game's best, youngsters duel with historic greats. Which players landed on the back half of our list?
With players across the league opting for sure money over the uncertainty of free agency, the time could be right for Chicago to lock up some of its controllable stars.
The Cubs are the latest team to be unhappy about their poor PECOTA projection. But is it silly to care?
""Last year I was late on a lot of pitches,"" Contreras said. ""It was just timing. I was loading late, and I'm putting hard work on it. So far it seems like I'm getting on it.""
An earlier load in the batter's box, a quarter-turn of his mitt on defense, a quieter, more controlled presence -- they're all part of a remake the Cubs hope will pay big dividends for their catcher in 2019. Ask a Cubs fan who the X factor is on the roster, and Contreras will be at the top of the list.
""I like to hear that,"" Contreras said. ""I like to read it. I'm working my best to get back to 2017.""
The comeback has begun. There are several Cubs whose turnarounds could have huge impacts, but as much as people talk about Yu Darvish, he affects one game out of every five. Contreras has a hand in everything, nearly every day.
""A top-of-the-line catcher is such gravy to a contending team,"" an NL scout said. ""Most of the time, you just want them to catch a good game. Any more than that, it can be huge.""
Maddon's focus is not on the subtle changes to Contreras' offense or defense. It's about his demeanor and his confidence. The talent is there. It just has to be harnessed.
""He's a confidence guy,"" Maddon said. ""The big thing with him is to act like he's done it before and he's going to do it again.""
Can he do it? Will a quieter version of Contreras be able to maintain the things that make him who he is? As the T-shirt says, don't believe him, just watch.
""There's a lot of people that doubted me because of last year,"" Contreras said. ""I'm going to be quiet.""

""I don't think we've made that decision yet, and I know that Honey [pitching coach Rick Honeycutt] has mapped out where we need to be, so right now, we're not ready to make that decision,"" Roberts said. ""We're just right now in a day-to-day with Clayton and trying to keep him in a positive state of mind.""
Kershaw played catch with teammate Rich Hill on Tuesday's off day and lined up down the right-field line with fellow pitchers Wednesday as several played catch. Kershaw's partner was bullpen catcher Steve Cilladi.
Although Cilladi did not crouch, Kershaw went into his unique windup before several throws, raising his hands over his head and pausing his leg in midmotion. Kershaw repeatedly backed up, eventually throwing from more than 75 feet, before moving closer to Cilladi and increasing the velocity on his throws.
Afterward, he flashed a thumbs-up to an observer and gave Cilladi a fist bump.
Prior to the afternoon throwing session, Roberts said: ""The distance is increasing a little bit, and most importantly, the intensity. So, for him to ramp up that intensity and recover the next day and still feel good, that's a good thing for us.""
As for when Kershaw will throw off a mound, Roberts said: ""We'll know more each day. We don't have a day right now.""
CATCHING ON
After several days of practice and Cactus League inactivity because of a sore lower back, veteran catcher Russell Martin started hitting and caught Walker Buehler's bullpen.
""Today is the first day I took some swings and I just got done, so it felt pretty good,"" Martin said. ""Obviously, it wasn't max effort, but it was definitely positive.""
Martin progressed from dry swings to hitting off a tee to soft toss.
""So far, so good,"" he said. ""We are taking it slow and trying to be smart about it.""
Martin's training room treatment has consisted of stretching, strengthening and ""getting some range of motion and strength in that newfound range of motion, and hopefully, that will keep me on the field,"" he said.
Roberts said: ""It is kind of a day-to-day thing -- depending on how Russell feels and the training staff -- whether we get him some at-bats on the other side [in minor league games] or just jump him right in and DH or just kind of throw him in the fire. Russell, as a veteran player, knows exactly what he needs to do to get ready, so even a week down, I don't think it will impact him too much.""
NOTES
Buehler has not appeared in a Cactus League game. Roberts said the right-hander is likely to throw live to hitters on Saturday or Sunday.
SS Corey Seager, completing his recovery from Tommy John surgery on May 4 and arthroscopic hip surgery on Aug. 7, was not in camp because of ""a little kind of a sickness, a little bug,"" according to Roberts. Because of that, Seager's planned appearance in a minor league game Thursday is doubtful.
Roberts and his staff will start to make cuts in the coming days, sending players to the minor league side. Position players will start to play in back-to-back Cactus League games, and starting pitchers will begin to throw increased innings in those games.
The Dodgers optioned LHP Adam McCreery and reassigned LHP Josh Smoker and RHPs Joe Broussard, Daniel Corcino and Jesen Therrien to minor league camp.

26150357,"""My strength is the same,"" said Severino, who suffered a shoulder injury minutes before a scheduled start against the Atlanta Braves on Tuesday. ""I feel like something pulled.""
An MRI late Tuesday afternoon revealed that Severino had right shoulder inflammation. It apparently set in after Severino threw a slider while throwing warm-up pitches at George M. Steinbrenner Field.
In the wake of Luis Severino's shoulder injury, we weigh in on who is most likely to get the nod March 28 in the Bronx.
For a pitcher as accomplished as Keuchel, there will always be interest. But time -- and his lack of velocity -- isn't on his side.
""His competition, for me, is in the monuments,"" Yankees legend Reggie Jackson said.
Severino said he didn't throw another pitch after he felt the twinge.
This was the first time Severino has experienced pain after throwing a slider. He went through a simulation game on a back field last Thursday and made it through with no issues, he said.
Because of the injury, manager Aaron Boone said Severino would be shut down for the next two weeks. Severino will take a cycle of anti-inflammatory medication as he rests his shoulder.
""Hopefully it's as short as necessary, but we need to make sure we give it the time also that's necessary,"" general manager Brian Cashman said Wednesday. ""He's an important piece and we're not going to have him for a period of time.
""We'll adjust. That's what everybody has to do. But it's obviously a very concerning situation until he's on the mound for a consistent amount of time to the point that you forget it ever happened.""
Cashman said Severino was due to receive a cortisone shot at some point Wednesday.
The Yankees hope Severino will be able to resume a throwing program after his two-week break. Boone said it was ""highly unlikely"" that Severino would start Opening Day as had been planned.
""It's frustrating, because the bad thing about baseball is you don't [always] get to play baseball,"" Severino said. ""This is the game that I love, and I want to be there for the team. It's going to be tough for a little bit, but after that, like I said, it's better it happened now than in midseason or at the end of the season.
""God has a plan for everybody, so it's better now than later.""
Until Severino returns, the Yankees plan to keep using the pitchers they currently have. Young pitchers Domingo German, Jonathan Loaisiga and Luis Cessa would contribute to that depth in the interim.
Although free-agent left-handed starter Dallas Keuchel remains unsigned, Cashman gave little indication that he would go after him or any other pitchers from outside the organization. He isn't completely ruling it out, but he seems lukewarm to the idea at the moment.
""What I've got is what I've got,"" Cashman said, ""and we're comfortable with that. Can't rule anything out, but I'd say the main focus is what we have.""
Cashman also said outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury, who has spent the start of spring training rehabbing at home in Arizona from a plantar fascia issue, is expected to rejoin the team in approximately 10 days.

26259301,"A single trade deadline, an All-Star Game election day and a million-dollar bonus for the Home Run Derby winner will be implemented in 2019 -- and a three-batter minimum for pitchers and roster expansion will happen in 2020 -- as part of a deal between Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association.
Spurred by labor relations discord amid a second consecutive free-agent market that has left players disappointed, the mid-collective-bargaining-agreement negotiations represent a step forward between two sides that had squabbled privately and publicly.
Perhaps the most important part of the deal isn't the elimination of August trades, the tweaking of All-Star Game starter selections, the incentives for stars to participate in the derby, the elimination of one-out relievers or the addition of a 26th player next year. It's the provision that the sides will begin discussing labor issues imminently, far earlier than they typically would with a CBA that doesn't expire until December 2021.
Those discussions, sources told ESPN, will center on the game's most fundamental economic tenets -- not only free agency but other macro issues with deep consequences. The bargaining over distribution of revenue could be the most difficult gap to bridge, with teams clearly paring back spending on aging players while players chafe at the notion that those 30 and older are no longer worthy of the deals they received in the past. While a compromise could be reached in distributing more money to the younger players whom the current system underpays, the complications of doing so warrant a long runway for discussions.
A major shake-up brings a new crew of All-Stars to the forefront, with some of the game's biggest names on the outside looking in.
Leading off our countdown of the game's best, youngsters duel with historic greats. Which players landed on the back half of our list?
You picked who? Where? We break down some of the questions to come out of the rankings -- and ask you to weigh in as well.
Other subjects to be broached include the manipulation of service time that keeps the best prospects in the minor leagues to begin a season, the luxury-tax threshold that some believe discourages spending, and the gathering of biometric data that has become commonplace among major league teams.
While the incentive is strong to repair fissures in the relationship -- and perhaps even extend the current CBA, which guaranteed more than a quarter-century of labor peace amid $10 billion-plus a year in industry revenues -- doing so will require significant compromise from both sides. The prospect of division internally in either party is palpable as well, whether it's players young and old or owners in large markets and small.
There is nevertheless optimism from commissioner Rob Manfred and union executive director Tony Clark after the most recent bargaining ended with a deal. Although the union did not formally accede to the three-batter minimum per pitcher that MLB sought, it agreed not to challenge the league's plans to implement it in 2020. MLB had the same ability to put a pitch clock in place this season but tabled it as part of the deal, with the hope that fewer pitching changes -- and shorter inning breaks, which are now down to two minutes for local and national games, per the deal -- will speed up games.
What will be in place this summer are a single July 31 trade deadline, an All-Star election day and a Home Run Derby with the game's biggest stars (both sides hope) vying for a $1 million bonus. Deals after the non-waiver deadline made August a hotbed for incremental upgrades by teams, and the union's hope is that getting rid of them will cause teams to be more aggressive in the offseason knowing that the fallback for August deals no longer is an option.
Though the consequences of the single trade deadline are unknown, the impact of an election day is clear: MLB gives itself a much-needed opportunity to market its players. Fans will vote online for All-Star starters, and the top three vote-getters will take part in a one-day election, which could lead to a bevy of clever electioneering, social media engagement and displays of personality players rarely show.
It will culminate in an All-Star week that includes a Home Run Derby with $2.5 million in prize money, including $1 million for the winner.
The 2020 provisions are likely to have a far greater impact on the field. In addition to the three-batter minimum, regular-season rosters will expand from 25 to 26 players while September rosters will contract to a maximum of 28 from the current 40. A committee between the sides that will study the game is expected to make recommendations on the maximum number of pitchers allowed on the rosters. In negotiations, the league proposed 13 during the first five months of the season and 14 in September.
The number of position players pitching could see a significant decrease as well. Under the agreement, players will be designated as position players or pitchers -- with the exception of those who throw 20-plus innings and start 20 games in the field or at DH, who will be two-way players. Position players will be allowed to pitch only in extra innings or when their team is ahead or behind by more than seven runs.

26228513,"Estevan Florial, long considered among the top talents in the Yankees' farm system, had fallen in the eyes of national prognosticators. Rated by some to be a top-50 prospect in 2018, Florial found himself below that entering 2019.
ESPN's Keith Law, troubled only in part by the more than two-month injury from a broken hamate bone Florial endured last year, again had him just outside of his top 100.
""His competition, for me, is in the monuments,"" Yankees legend Reggie Jackson said.
After a season-ending concussion, the Yankees outfielder just wanted peace and quiet. But his doctor had a very different idea: Turn it up to 11.
As the slugger who took the Bronx by storm last season battles Greg Bird for a spot on Opening Day, he's focused on turning his biggest weakness into a strength.
All of which raises the questions: Is the 21-year-old center fielder still a rising star? Has the flame around the Bombers' former No. 1 prospect burned out?
The Yankees, for their part, say Florial is shining brighter than ever.
""He's got as high a ceiling as just about anyone in that clubhouse,"" manager Aaron Boone said earlier this spring. ""Nothing's changed there.""
Added veteran outfielder Brett Gardner: ""As talented as he is, it's not going to be long before we see him put it all together.
""He's got a bright career ahead of him for sure.""
The proof of that, the Yankees believe, rests with how Florial has performed both this spring and last.
A year ago, the outfielder showcased his best asset -- his speed -- by racing around the bases to the tune of three triples in 21 spring training games. His range in the field caught attention, as did the work he put in behind the scenes.
Fast-forward to this spring, and the Yankees say they believe there's even more reason for optimism.
Entering play this week, Florial had a .333 batting average with a .926 OPS, a home run, four RBIs and four stolen bases through only 10 spring training games. Although he still had seven strikeouts and only two walks, his pitch recognition -- one area where he has struggled in the past -- has generally improved.
""[I'm] trying to get more control of the strike zone,"" Florial said at the start of the spring.
A prime example of that came on one swing Florial had last Thursday in a game against the Phillies in nearby Clearwater. With two on in the top of the sixth, he made a midswing adjustment to a pitch riding middle-in, and stroked a hard liner over the wall in left-center.

The three-run, opposite-field shot had the visitors dugout buzzing about the lefty's sweet swing.
""I mean, wow. There is a short list of people who can hit a ball hard like that,"" Boone said to reporters after that game. ""I told that to Reggie Jackson on the bench.""
Jackson, according to Boone, turned to the manager and said he knew that list was short -- because the Hall of Famer was on the list.
Another Yankees legend, former infielder Willie Randolph, has been similarly moved by what he has seen from Florial this spring. Randolph went so far as to describe Florial as a ""young Bernie Williams"" to the New York Post last week. Considering Williams had his No. 51 jersey retired four years ago, that's not a bad comparison for the youngster to draw.
""The way he goes about his business, his work ethic, just his desire and his willingness to listen and to learn and get better, I don't see many 20-, 21-year-old kids come through here that are that mature,"" Gardner said.
That maturity manifests itself in the patience Florial exhibits. Days after the Yankees re-signed center fielder Aaron Hicks to a seven-year, $70 million extension, Florial was asked if he was nervous he might be considered a trade chip now. After all, the long-term investment in Hicks had to mean the Yankees saw little future for Florial, right?
""We love Hicks here. Who wouldn't like to have Hicks on their ballclub?"" Florial said. ""For me, I'm blessed to have him next to me, so I can learn from him.""
A lower back injury has kept Hicks out much of the past two weeks, giving Florial more chances.

General manager Brian Cashman has been pondering whether Florial's year should begin at Single-A Tampa (where he hit .255 with three homers, three triples, 27 RBIs and was 11-for-21 in stolen bases in an injury-shortened 75 games last year) or Double-A Trenton. If he begins at Double-A, it would be the highest level Florial has played in the Yankees' organization.
Signed out of the Dominican Republic in 2015, Florial has spent the past two springs as a non-roster invitee. In addition to showing off his power in this one, Florial has been let loose on the basepaths.
In a game last week against Atlanta, Florial led off the bottom of the seventh inning by beating out an infield single. Two batters and two outs later, the wheels came out again.
After stealing second base, the speedster advanced to third on a passed ball. Then he scored on a wild pitch. Florial had manufactured a run in a way the powerful Yankees (who set a single-season home run record last season with 267) don't often do.
These anecdotes -- the three-run home run and the blistering baserunning speed leading to a score -- are prime examples of why the Yankees remain high on Florial, even if others are lukewarm.
""He doesn't recognize pitches well enough to get to his tools. Florial has bat speed, power, running speed, athleticism, quick twitch and all the tools that glitter, but his ability to pick up pitch types is not good enough to put him into the top 100,"" Law wrote in January. Meanwhile, MLB.com's prospect rankings saw Florial fall a dozen spots this year, from No. 45 to No. 57, and, after being ranked No. 38 last year by Baseball America, he slipped off their top 100 entirely.
Still, Boone likes what he sees: ""His ceiling, it's why he's probably always considered the [Yankees'] No. 1 prospect. It's [a] good reason. I remember first seeing him last year and one of the things that grabs you is just how physical he is. He's good to look at. He looks the part. He's tall, he's built. Still obviously a very young man.
""I don't know if it's necessarily changed in my eyes, because I remember being really impressed with the way he looks on a baseball field.""
"
26273910,"""I think he's going to miss a significant amount of time,"" manager Dave Martinez said Friday.
Taylor favored his left leg as he limped through the clubhouse earlier in the day before heading to undergo an MRI.
""He's a big part of our ballclub,"" Martinez said after getting test results. ""So I just hope that he recovers quickly, and we can get him back out there as soon as possible.""
The Rookie of the Year runner-up put up historic numbers as a teenager. Now 20, he's the new heart of the Nats' lineup -- and drawing comparisons not just to his former teammate but also to Mike Trout.
Taylor had been set to enter the season as one of Washington's top four outfielders; it appeared he was going to be the first one off the bench, behind starters Adam Eaton in right, Juan Soto in left and rookie Victor Robles in center.
Robles and Taylor are the only true center fielders available to Martinez, who acknowledged Friday, ""You're correct: There's no outfield depth,"" after a reporter brought up the issue.
Bryce Harper, of course, has departed for the Philadelphia Phillies, a year after another starter, Jayson Werth, left the Nationals. The club traded two backups last season, and while Eaton is a veteran starter, Soto was an unexpected revelation at 19 last season, and Robles appears ready to make an impact at 21, Taylor was the only other sure thing in the outfield.
Taylor said his knee and hip stiffened shortly after he made a diving catch in center during the second inning of Washington's 10-4 victory over Minnesota on Thursday.
""I went to slide, and the outfield was a little soft, and my knee stuck in the ground,"" Taylor said.
In the moment, Martinez said, ""It was kind of scary. I ran out of the dugout right away, because it didn't look too good.""
Now Andrew Stevenson will see time in center field, and the team could look for other options.
""When you start a season with just four outfielders, you want a guy who can play center field,"" Martinez said. ""So we're going to have to really look for that guy.""
Matt Adams, a backup first baseman, started Washington's 11-3 win against the New York Mets on Friday. Of the more than 470 starts Adams has made in his major league career, only 30 came in left.
Martinez said that Wilmer Difo, a backup infielder, also will see time in the outfield in the coming days.
Another utility player who can play in the outfield, Howie Kendrick, is working his way back after straining his left hamstring in a game March 5. Martinez said Kendrick is not yet running at full speed.
Game notes
Newly signed LHP Tony Sipp said he's been throwing two bullpen sessions a week since January. ""But,"" the reliever added, ""still always different when you get a batter in the box. I haven't thrown to live batters. The arm is ready. Just kicking it into the next gear is going to be a challenge here in the next two weeks."" Washington opens the regular season March 28. Sipp threw a side session of 35 pitches Thursday, and Martinez said: ""My biggest thing with him -- and I talked to him yesterday -- is: 'As much as we want you for Opening Day, you missed significant time in spring training, so hopefully you're ready. But if you're not, you're not. But we want you to be fully ready, so if it takes you an extra three or four appearances down here, so be it.""

26025602,"The Cincinnati Reds star led the National League in on-base percentage last year but hit just 12 homers, his fewest in a full season, and batted .284, his lowest since 2014. He had 67 RBIs.
""It was the first year where I had a poor offensive year,"" Votto said. ""It is hard to speak on this without sounding arrogant. I've always performed at a certain level. Last year was a bit of a shock. I didn't perform anywhere near to what I'm used to.""
Votto, who turns 36 in September, was hit on the right knee by a pitch from Ryan Madson in August and went on the disabled list. His numbers were down even before the injury.
Votto hit 37 homers during his 2010 NL MVP season and had 36 with 100 RBIs in 2017. He spent this offseason refining his swing.
""I did things differently, so I hope it works,"" Votto said. ""Intuitively, I know why I wasn't ready and came up short last year. I just made sure I didn't do that again and learn from my mistakes. I feel very confident. I'm excited to work.""
Votto is owed $25 million annually through 2023, and the Reds have a $20 million option for 2024 with a $7 million buyout. He has spoken over the years about his desire to help the Reds become a winning team again.
Cincinnati overhauled its roster following its fourth straight season of 94 or more losses, adding starting pitchers Alex Wood, Sonny Gray and Tanner Roark along with outfielders Yasiel Puig and Matt Kemp.
""We've added All-Stars,"" Votto said. ""We've added guys with long track records. They have a lot of things to gain by playing very well here. Hopefully, we carry that into a winning performance.""

26191979,"Jump to each potential baseball rule change: Robo umps! | End of the shift | Three-batter minimum | Moving the mound back

The rule change: Using TrackMan radar to help umpires call balls and strikes.
What it would mean: Robot umps! According to ESPN Stats & Information data, the correct call rate on balls and strikes in 2018 was 91.1 percent. How robot umpires could be implemented is yet to be determined, but the goal is obviously to improve the accuracy of ball and strike calls. Keep in mind, however, that the technology is far from perfect.
As a basic example, the generic strike-zone graphics you see on TV broadcasts don't adjust the size of the strike zone to the size of the batter, such as Aaron Judge compared with Jose Altuve. Until the players start wearing sensors on their jerseys, there is still guesswork involved at the top and bottom of the zone.
Potential impact on baseball: Well, Jeff Mathis would probably be out of a job. The average MLB game in 2018 featured 297 pitches, with 157 of those called strikes or balls. Given an incorrect call rate of 8.9 percent, that means about 14 pitches per game are missed -- with a certain percentage of those ball/strike calls influenced by catchers like Mathis who are good at framing pitches. That skill set would become less valuable -- or, presumably, have no value at all. That could lead to a return of better-hitting catchers, at least if they can still throw and work with a pitching staff. Of course, maybe even the art of calling a game would disappear once we got to robot pitch selections.
Likeliness MLB would adopt: Strong ... though not immediately. In recent years, MLB commissioned a study in a number of major league stadiums to test the viability of using radar systems to track strikes. Because of imperceptible changes in weather, crowd size or other factors that ever-so-slightly moved the systems' components, the would-be strike zone actually changed location game by game. The argument, of course, is that game-by-game strike-zone changes already happen with different umpires manning home plate -- and that's a salient point. What baseball doesn't want is technology, whose greatest attribute is its consistence and relative infallibility, failing an early test and losing momentum. When there are robot umps -- and there will be -- it will be Version 3.0 or 4.0. This is 1.0.

The rule change: Two infielders must be on each side of the second-base bag when the pitch is released, with the penalty being the pitch is called a ball.
What it would mean: The end of the shift.
Potential impact on baseball: The majority of shifts are against left-handed batters, especially slow left-handed sluggers who pull everything while trying to hit home runs. According to Sports Info Solutions, there were nearly 35,000 shifts employed in 2018 -- counting only balls in play when the shift was on -- a 30 percent increase from 2017 and 93 percent increase from 2014. The five most shifted hitters were Kyle Seager, Matt Carpenter, Freddie Freeman, Anthony Rizzo and Matt Olson. The only right-handed batter in the top 30 was Edwin Encarnacion. SIS estimated that Carpenter lost the most hits to the shift in 2018: a net total of 23 (33 lost, 10 gained). Give him an additional 23 hits and his batting average increases from .257 to .298. (All data from ""The Bill James Handbook."")
Robot umpires, a 62-foot, 6-inch distance between the pitcher's mound and home plate, and no infield shifting are among the rule changes coming to the Atlantic League.
The men in the dugout aren't thrilled with rumors of rules changes to ban a defensive tactic they're using more than ever.
Banning the shift is a hot topic in baseball. Here's why the conventional wisdom on it is wrong.
Overall, SIS estimated that the shift saved 592 runs in 2018 -- an average of 19.7 per team -- as the batting average on grounders and short liners went down. Russell Carleton of Baseball Prospectus, however, wrote up a study last May that came to a much different conclusion. He concluded that while singles do go down against a full shift, walks go up (and home runs go up slightly as well), outweighing the benefits of eliminating some base hits. Obviously, the analytics departments within teams haven't reached the same conclusions as Carleton given the continued increase in shifts, but maybe the assumed benefits of the shift aren't so cut-and-dried. Just don't tell Matt Carpenter.
Likeliness MLB would adopt: This is a hard one. The shift is dynamic, not just in the infinite forms it can take but the number of opinions it generates. Hard-boiled scouts like it because they believe in the sanctity of restriction-free defensive alignments. Some analysts abhor it because it only compounds the lack of action in modern baseball. Other analysts revere it because it can be so efficient at generating outs. Plenty more scouts scoff at it as data run amok. The study by Carleton -- who now works for the Mets -- was brilliant in its rigor and the counterintuitiveness of its conclusion. Even more complex are the unintended consequences of a rule change. If pre-pitch shifts are limited, will defensive players be sent in motion as the pitch is being thrown? Does baseball really want to open a Pandora's box of restrictiveness on account of some singles being lost? Ultimately, that's in the hands of commissioner Rob Manfred, and he's the one who has broached publicly the possibility of ending the shift.

The rule change: A three-batter minimum for pitchers (a rule change MLB and the players' association are considering for 2020).
What it would mean: Fewer within-inning pitching changes, speeding up the pace of the game.
Potential impact on baseball: There were 1,145 relief appearances in 2018 of one batter faced and another 1,143 of two batters. The top five pitchers last season in relief appearances of one or two batters:
Andrew Chafin: 35
Oliver Perez: 33
Tim Hill: 30
Luis Avilan: 30
Jerry Blevins: 27
As you might expect, all are lefties. In fact, the only righties in the top 25 were Steve Cishek and Luis Garcia. The good news is MLB may be already trending away from the one-batter appearances -- in part because starters are throwing fewer innings and you need more outs from relievers who can't be wasted on one-batter appearances. In 2015, there were 1,398 one-batter appearances.
With a three-batter minimum, there will be some lefty specialists who will be out of work, or at least in much less demand. That in turn could help left-handed batters, who face more of the one-batter relievers. Left-handed hitters had a .753 OPS against right-handed pitchers in 2018, but a .668 OPS against left-handed pitchers.
Likeliness MLB would adopt: 100 percent. MLB wants this to help limit pitching changes and speed up games. The players' association doesn't mind it because even if it's killing a job class, the union believes the market for relief pitching will remain robust and what it's getting as part of the deal to bring in the three-batter minimum is a worthwhile trade.

The rule change: Increasing the distance from the pitching rubber to home plate from 60 feet, 6 inches to 62 feet, 6 inches (in the second half of the season).
What it would mean: The pitching rubber has been at 60 feet, 6 inches since 1893. The height of the mound has changed and the definition of the strike zone has changed several times, but the distance from the rubber to home plate has remained a constant for 126 years. Increasing the pitching distance would certainly have an impact on strikeouts as MLB officials look to stem the rising tide of whiffs.
Which talented stars of tomorrow found a home on this year's list?
Top 100: 100-51  | 50-1 | Top systems   | Complete top prospect coverage
Potential impact: Unknown -- but potentially drastic, at least in the short term as pitchers adjust after throwing at one distance since they were teenagers. Not only would batters have a slightly longer reaction time to those blazing fastballs, but pitchers would have to tweak their breaking balls and off-speed pitches to get them to work at the longer distance. All this could lead to a huge increase in offense -- more hits, more home runs, more walks -- and longer games because of the increase in runs.
We don't have a lot to go on here, but consider these numbers from 2018:
Batters against fastballs of 92 to 93 mph: .272/.361/.474
Batters against fastball of 95 to 96 mph: .246/.330/.406
When the height of the mound was lowered in 1969, the average runs per game increased from 3.42 in 1968 to 4.07 (it was also an expansion year). A similar 19 percent increase in scoring would increase the average runs per game from 4.45 in 2018 to 5.30 -- which would be higher than the peak season of the steroid era, 5.14 runs per game in 2000. It will certainly be fascinating to see the results in the Atlantic League.
Likeliness MLB would adopt: Slim but certainly not none. It's not just the iconic numbers of 60 feet, 6 inches. Moving the mound up or down already has a drastic enough effect (see 1968 vs. 1969). Shifting it back could fundamentally alter a number of the game's elements. First: the ability to pitch effectively. Every single pitcher in the world has thrown from a 60-6 distance since their teen years. Breaking balls are calibrated to move at 60-6. Changeups sink at a certain point. Maybe it's an overestimation to think this -- and it's what makes a test like the Atlantic League's important -- but the potential for enormous change feels real. Pitchers and hitters would have to recalibrate themselves, learn how to adjust to something seemingly minuscule but in reality incredibly difficult.
The Atlantic League experiment may prove how long that recalibration and adjustment take -- and whether it's actually viable enough to at least consider testing out in the affiliated minor leagues before potential major league adoption.
More potential changes: Aside from those major rules changes, the Atlantic League will also eliminate mound visits except for pitching changes or injuries, increase the size of the bags, and reduce the time between innings and pitching changes.
The Atlantic League already employs a pitch clock, which the commissioner's office had discussed unilaterally employing for 2019 until recently backing off that proposal until 2022 if it reaches some common ground with the union on other rules changes.
The pitch clock would obviously speed up the pace of the game. Grant Bisbee of SB Nation compared a full game from 1984 to one from 2014, two games featuring similar totals of pitches, baserunners and batters. The 1984 game lasted 2 hours, 31 minutes; the 2014 game lasted 3 hours, 6 minutes. There were nine more minutes of commercials in 2014, but as Grant wrote, ""Time between pitches is the primary villain"" of the longer game now. The time between ""inaction"" pitches -- there were 146 such pitches in the 1984 game, 144 in 2014 -- increased 25 minutes, or about an extra nine seconds between pitches.
Pitchers would have to adopt to a pitch clock, especially power-throwing relievers who tend to take more time between pitches. But former major leaguers Mark Teixeira and Carlos Pena have both talked in recent weeks about how a clock could also hurt batters, who would have less time to think and collect themselves between pitches.
So the impact here is unknown -- except the pace of the game would definitely improve.

26031416,"It took 113 days of free agency to play out, but Manny Machado is headed to San Diego on the largest deal ever handed out to a free agent. What does the deal mean for baseball's new $300 million man, the team that signed him and other interested parties (read: Harper, Bryce)? We asked ESPN baseball writers Eddie Matz, David Schoenfield, Bradford Doolittle and Sam Miller to break it down.
Gut reaction: Do you like this deal for the Padres?
Miller: Gut reaction, yes. The Padres probably won't be very good this year, but with the best current farm system in baseball they probably will be quite good in many of the next half-dozen years, and players like Manny Machado aren't just freely available to pick up when a team decides to flip the switch and compete. They just got an MVP candidate for the middle of the lineup and all it cost them was money.
By signing the biggest free-agent deal in sports history, both the player and the Padres knew exactly what they were doing.
A team spending to win? The third baseman's move to San Diego changes the prospect-packed Friars' timetable for a return to contention.
Manny Machado's value doesn't change much in San Diego, but his move to the Padres will impact your fantasy draft.
Schoenfield: Absolutely. Over the past four seasons, Machado has averaged 36 home runs, 159 games and 5.8 WAR. They gave superstar money to a superstar player, as opposed to superstar-type money to Eric Hosmer. Machado becomes the face of the franchise and by midseason will likely be teaming with rookie Fernando Tatis Jr. to give the Padres one of the best left sides of the infield in the majors. For a franchise that hasn't had a winning season since 2010 or made the playoffs since 2006, they finally are moving in the right direction.
Matz: What's not to like? Manny immediately brings major sizzle to San Diego.
Doolittle: Absolutely. This gives San Diego's entire rebuild a firm foundation. As big as the contract numbers are, it's fair value for what Machado is likely to do in the future and because of his age and the length of his track record, the risk is comparatively low for a deal this large.
Who is the biggest winner of Machado joining the Padres?
Miller: Cleveland. With the White Sox failing to sign Machado, Cleveland can now be pretty sure no other team in the division will win even 85 games this year. Terry Francona can start resting his players for the playoffs ... now.
Schoenfield: Baseball writers. Something to write about besides ""Where will Machado and Harper end up?"" OK, the free-agent market is also the winner here, because for all the whining, Machado got the contract everyone expected at the start of free agency.
Matz: Machado. Forget about the $300 mil -- he gets to live in San Diego! Close runner-up: Bryce Harper. If Machado is getting $300 million from the Friars, imagine the check that John ""Stupid Money"" Middleton is going to cut to seal the deal for Harper.
Doolittle: Is it snarky to say that it's Rob Manfred? In that little verbal slap fight he had through the media with Tony Clark on Monday, isn't this pretty much what he said would happen? If the ship be sinking, how did a player get a contract like THIS?
Who is the biggest loser of Machado joining the Padres?
Miller: I don't really see a loser. The Padres got a good player, the player got a reasonable contract, and the other 29 teams all have plenty else to worry about.
Schoenfield: The Phillies. Reports all along suggested Machado was the player they preferred over Harper. Now one of them is off the board and there's no guarantee Harper will sign there either.
As Manny Machado's signing with the Padres sinks in, here are five facts about the deal that will blow your mind -- or, at the very least, impress your friends:
1. Machado's $300 million deal is the largest for a free agent in American sports history, surpassing A-Rod's 10-year, $275 million deal.
2. By adding Machado at $300 million after signing Eric Hosmer for $144 million last winter, the Padres have spent more on two players than they did in their previous 25 offseasons combined.
3. Machado was a free agent (113 days) longer than he was a Dodger (102 days).
4. Machado was an All-Star starter in 2018. Who was the last Padres position player to start a Midsummer Classic? That would be Tony Gwynn in 1998. (Though we should note that Wil Myers got the hometown start at DH in 2016.)
5. The Padres signed Machado on Feb. 19, 2019 -- one year to the day after they inked Hosmer.
Matz: Fernando Tatis Jr. So what if Manny is way better at third base. If he wants to play shortstop, then Tatis -- the No. 2-ranked prospect in baseball -- might get bumped to the hot corner.
Doolittle: Ian Kinsler, because now he'll be a utility guy? Sorry, but I'm not seeing many losers in this scenario. There are all the teams that might have wanted Machado (or should have), but the only one I'd term a real loser is the Phillies. But that's only the case if they don't end up with Harper.
Now that Machado is headed to San Diego, who is the favorite to land Bryce Harper?
Miller: Machado getting a normal deal reassures us that this is still a relatively normal market and probably rules out the possibility that some team was going to swoop in and get Harper for a short deal or an unthinkable bargain. So the most likely outcome is probably just the least surprising one: the Phillies.
Schoenfield: Most people will say the Phillies. We'll see.
Matz: Phillies.
Doolittle: It's got to be the Phillies. I thought the White Sox might be able to top any Machado offer, but if it comes down to them outbidding Philly on Harper, I don't see Jerry Reinsdorf pulling the trigger. Philadelphia just has more reasons to extend itself.
Manny got $300 million over 10 years. How much more do you think Harper will get?
Miller: Ten and $330 million.
Manny Machado is headed to the Padres on the richest deal ever signed by a free agent. Here's what to make of the $300 million contract. Winners and losers
• Doolittle: Why the deal makes sense
• Law: Machado accelerates Padres
• Schoenfield: Fallout for Bryce, baseball
• Fantasy impact | Machado timeline
Schoenfield: How desperate are the Phillies? That's what we don't know. I think Machado is the better player -- or at least the more consistent. Harper has the bigger upside based on his 2015 season, but there are more risks involved, especially given his poor defense in 2018. But Scott Boras probably will find a way to extract a couple extra million more than Machado received. And then everyone can stop their whining.
Matz: Harper gets $350 million over 10 years, simultaneously breaking Giancarlo Stanton's record for largest contract ever -- $325 million -- and Zack Greinke's mark for highest AAV, $34.4 million.
Doolittle: I'll say 10 years, $330 million. It's ""only"" an extra $3 million per year than Machado got and it's $5 million more in total value than Stanton's deal. It seems like that's the kind of thing Boras and Harper would push for.

26129656,"Six months after the 2018 Yankees set major league baseball's single-season team home run record, Judge and Gardner foresee the 2019 Yankees shattering that historic mark.
""His competition, for me, is in the monuments,"" Yankees legend Reggie Jackson said.
CC Sabathia threw 16 pitches in his first bullpen since having a heart procedure in December, and Gary Sanchez played in his first spring game following a shoulder injury.
No Manny Machado or Bryce Harper, but extensions for Luis Severino and Aaron Hicks? Things worked out just fine the last time the Bombers locked up their core and complemented it with shrewd trades.
""We're going to hit more this year,"" Gardner said Sunday.
Asked whether he agreed with Gardner's emphatic statement, Judge doubled down.
""Oh definitely. You get this whole team healthy, we're going to crush the record that we set last year,"" Judge said. ""We've got a good team, a lot of guys that could make a lot of solid contact, and a lot of big boys that when they make contact, man, it goes. We're a team that's primed and ready to do that.""
The 267 homers the Bronx Bombers slugged last season -- Gleyber Torres' record-setting blast was crushed at Fenway Park late last September -- outpaced the 264 the 1997 Seattle Mariners had hit.
The Yankees' record-breaking season came during a year that was fraught with injuries to key power hitters. Judge was out for two months with a broken wrist. Groin strains sent Gary Sanchez to the disabled list twice. An early-season ankle surgery slowed Greg Bird and may have led to a general lack of production from him late in the year.
Two of those hitters had homer drop-offs from their 2017 seasons. Judge went from 52 home runs in his Rookie of the Year campaign in 2017 to 27 last year. Sanchez fell from 33 to 18.
""So far in camp, everybody's healthy, everybody's hungry and working hard,"" Gardner said. ""Yeah, I expect us to have a better year, collectively, and not just me, or Giancarlo [Stanton] or Bird or whoever. But collectively as a unit, I expect us to be a better offense and score more runs.""
The 5-foot-11 Gardner said he has joked often with the hulking Stanton and Judge about them individually posting massive homer totals.
""I tell them, anybody can hit 50,"" Gardner said, drawing laughter from reporters. ""I know I run my mouth a lot to everybody ... [but] we'll see. Whether it's 42 or 62 or something in between, we all know what they're capable of and how much raw power they have. It's a lot of fun to watch. Seems like every day or every other day I still get amazed by what they're able to do.
""The key for them is just to stay healthy, just like everybody. Stay on the field.""
Gardner made his comments just after hitting a pair of home runs in three plate appearances in Sunday's 7-1 split-squad win over Detroit at George M. Steinbrenner Field.
Judge also had two, although the second was aided by Tigers right fielder Victor Reyes, who wasn't able to cleanly catch the hard-hit liner toward the right-field wall. The ball skipped off his glove and over the wall. Like the left-handed-hitting Gardner, both of the right-handed Judge's homers were hit to right field.
""Anytime he hits two, he starts running his mouth,"" Judge said from his locker as Gardner started shouting back in the distance.
""Stay over there, man. That's why we're this far apart,"" Judge retorted, laughing.
After the first homer Gardner hit, Judge said the 35-year-old veteran was insufferable in the dugout.
""He just kind of mouthed off and all of a sudden he hits the second one and he says, 'Hey, anybody can do it once or twice. What you guys [got]?'"" Judge said. ""I told him anybody can pull the ball, try hitting the ball oppo.""
In addition to their four home runs, Sanchez, returning to game action over the weekend after offseason shoulder surgery, hit his first spring training home run. Minor leaguer Isiah Gilliam also crushed his own opposite-field blast. In the other split-squad game at the Blue Jays' facility, Yankees first baseman Luke Voit homered in a 5-2 loss.

26062026,"The minor league deal includes an invite to big league camp, where he will compete for a place on the Reds' bench.
""He provides great depth. He's been a shortstop, he's played second base, third base,"" Reds manager David Bell said Saturday. ""He's been a successful major league player on really good teams. He brings experience of winning. If he makes the team, he will make us a deeper, better team.""
Bell made it clear that Jose Peraza will be the Reds' starting shortstop.
""Peraza has made great strides. We believe in what he's doing,"" Bell said. ""We need to be as strong as we can with all 12 guys that make our team as position players.""
Iglesias hit .269 with five home runs and 48 RBIs for the Detroit Tigers in 2018. In 656 major league games with the Tigers and Boston Red Sox, he has hit .270 with a .315 on-base percentage. He was an All-Star in 2015.
""I'm looking forward to the opportunity to help this team be special this year,"" Iglesias said.
The 29-year-old Iglesias, who defected from Cuba to play baseball for the Red Sox, made his big league debut in 2011 with Boston. He was traded to the Tigers in 2013 and finished second in the American League rookie of the year vote.
It has been five years since Iglesias played any other position but shortstop. He played 37 games at third base and three games at second base for Boston in 2013.
Being versatile will add to Iglesias' chances of earning a job with the Reds.
""We will figure it out. At the end of the day it's about helping the team win a game,"" Iglesias said about changing positions.

26237680,"Tebow will likely begin the season at Triple-A Syracuse. He went 4-for-15 and had an RBI for the Mets in Grapefruit League action.
The 31-year-old outfielder hit .273 with six homers and 36 RBIs at Double-A Binghamton in 2018, his second full season in the minors. His season ended when he broke the hamate bone in his right hand while swinging, an injury that required surgery.
The former Heisman Trophy winner has hit .244 with 14 home runs and 88 RBIs in 210 minor league games since signing with the Mets in 2016 after playing three seasons in the NFL but failing to make it as a quarterback.
The Mets also sent Jacob Rhame, Paul Sewald, Arquimedes Caminero, Andres Gimenez, Dilson Herrera, Rymer Liriano and Ali Sanchez to minor league camp Tuesday.

26027430,"Vladimir Guerrero Sr. gave him just one piece of advice: to follow in the footsteps of one of his teammates, one who is considered a member of the family and whom he has known since he was six-years-old -- veteran Blue Jays DH Kendrys Morales.
Morales, now in his 13th season in Major League Baseball, defected from Cuba in 2004 and went on to sign a six-year, $4.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels that winter.
When Morales first arrived in the Angels clubhouse, it was Guerrero Sr. who took him under his wing. Morales eventually broke out big, delivering a 34-home run season in 2009 -- Guerrero Sr.'s last season with the team -- driving in 108 runs while hitting .306 as the Angels' first baseman. After stints with the Seattle Mariners and Minnesota Twins, Morales served as the DH for the Kansas City Royals in their championship season in 2015.
The highly touted Blue Jays phenom showed up early for fielding drills and BP and talked about using a bat much like his father's.
Blue Jays general manager Ross Atkins says that the team has no firm timeline for when megaprospect Vladimir Guerrero Jr. will join the big league club this season.
""When I was a rookie, Vladimir was a major league superstar,"" Morales said. ""And while he was a great ballplayer, he's a better person. He was so humble. I got to know the Guerrero family very well and he would take me to his house and take care of me like a member of his family. And now it's my turn to do the same thing he did with me. He taught me everything I know about being a major league player and I hope I can do the same for his son, the way he did with me. We all know the kind of talent that Vladimir Jr. has. He's very smart at the plate, and those are things you can't teach. He's got natural ability. And if he continues to work hard he'll be a superstar like his father.""
Now, the Hall of Famer hopes Morales can pay him back in kind by doing the same with his son, ""Vladdy,"" the uniquely talented prospect touted as baseball's best by multiple MLB analysts and sources. Guerrero Jr. earned that on the strength of his hitting .381/.437/.636 with 20 home runs in the minor leagues last season.
""I have never said this to anyone: When I told my dad I got the spring training invite, he told me, 'Son, you want to be the best? Do you want to continue being the best? Wherever Kendrys Morales goes, you follow,'"" Guerrero told ESPN. ""I asked him why he would say that to me, and he replied, 'When Kendrys Morales was a rookie, he did all the things that you need to do by following my example. Anywhere I went, he followed. So what you see in him, that's the way I did things when I was playing.'""
Guerrero has taken his father's advice to heart, frequently gathering with around Morales' locker alongside other young Latin players, such as Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Teoscar Hernández, and fellow prospects Richard Ureña and David Paulino, to listen to stories about his own father's playing days with the Angels.
""Kendrys Morales is like my dad,"" Guerrero said. ""I say that because I grew up alongside him, and right now I feel really proud to play with him, and he says he feels proud to play with me.""
Fueling the anticipation of fans, Guerrero Jr., has, apparently by accident, been putting on a show.
""(During batting practice,) my focus is to hit the ball way over the shortstop or over the second baseman ... and the ball goes out,"" he said. ""If the ball goes out of the park during a game, it's not going to bother me. But I am not out there looking to hit a home run.""
But Opening Night of the ""Vladdy Show"" likely won't be on Opening Day.
The Blue Jays have been targets of widespread criticism, as it is anticipated that Guerrero will start the year in Triple-A instead of proving his major league worth from day one. Nonetheless, Vladdy seems to be in no hurry.
""Every single day, I work hard to be better. Every player wants to be with their team on Opening Day. But for me, I just want to work and work until that day comes,"" he said. ""I don't know when that will be. It could be at the beginning (of the season) or at the end. It's their decision. And what I have to do is work hard.""
And to Jays fans, Guerrero preached patience.
""They have to trust -- trust that the day will come. The day will come. No one wants this more desperately than my family,"" he said. ""But thank God, I have a lot of faith in God. and I always say, 'The day will come.' I am 19 years old, and I have been waiting 19 years for this. When the day comes, it will come.""

26031051,"Manny Machado has agreed to the biggest free-agent contract in American sports history -- a 10-year, $300 million deal with the San Diego Padres, league sources told ESPN's Jeff Passan on Tuesday.
Machado, a four-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove Award winner at third base, made $16 million between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Baltimore Orioles last season.
The deal with the Padres, which is pending a physical, includes an opt-out after the fifth season and a limited no-trade clause, league sources told ESPN. It is expected to be officially announced Thursday or Friday.
Padres owners Ron Fowler and Peter Seidler wouldn't confirm the deal and said discussions are ""continuing.""
""Ron and I, we love the city of San Diego. We love sports in San Diego. We're also well aware of the history,"" Seidler said. ""There's never been a championship. ... We as an organization, we want to completely change that. We want our franchise to win year after year after year. And we're going to do whatever we can rationally do to make that happen.""
As Manny Machado heads to San Diego on the largest contract ever given to a free agent, we break down what the deal means for the infielder, the Padres and a certain other available star.
By signing the biggest free-agent deal in sports history, both the player and the Padres knew exactly what they were doing.
A team spending to win? The third baseman's move to San Diego changes the prospect-packed Friars' timetable for a return to contention.
General manager A.J. Preller also wouldn't comment on the deal but spoke Tuesday about the Padres' approach to building a ballclub.
""If the right guys are out there -- guys we feel fit in a long-term plan -- we want to build it year-to-year, basically. As we get going, add the right piece at the right time,"" Preller said. ""You can wait for some of the young talent we built up and look at three, four years, then try to hope the right guys are out there at that time, but I think we figured as a group if pieces that fit for us both in the short term, long term are out there, that's how you build a club.
""I think we understand now the key is to turn what we feel like we built from a system standpoint and turn that into a winning product on the big league field. It's not about looking up at a group and saying we have an elite farm system.""
Machado, 26, posted a career-high .905 OPS in 2018, finishing the season with a .297/.367/.538 slash line, 37 home runs, 107 RBIs and 14 stolen bases. In 66 regular-season games with the Dodgers, he hit .273 with 13 homers and 42 RBIs.
Padres players were ecstatic Tuesday, even though the signing was not yet official.
""You see me smiling right here,'' said first baseman Eric Hosmer, who exactly a year ago finalized a $144 million, eight-year deal with San Diego. ""We've all been practicing today, obviously. We've all kind of heard what's been going on, and all we can say is he's a guy we'd love to have, and I think it changes things pretty quickly if we do have him here.
""He's one of the top guys in the league,'' Hosmer added. ""Obviously, extremely young free agent that's got a lot of amazing baseball left in him, and he's already had a lot of amazing baseball in his career. We're all just glad he'll hopefully be here with us in San Diego.''
The Padres, who have missed the playoffs in 12 consecutive seasons, ranked 28th in the majors last season after averaging 3.8 runs per game.
Machado has hit 30 home runs in each of the past four seasons; only Wil Myers (2017) has surpassed that mark for the Padres in that span. Only six times in Padres history has a player hit more home runs in a season than Machado did in 2018. The last to do so was Adrian Gonzalez (40) in 2009.
Myers was the last Padres player to start an All-Star Game in 2016, serving in the designated hitter role. The Padres' last position player to start an All-Star Game was Tony Gwynn in 1998.
""It's exciting to be able to add a star, somebody like that in the middle of the lineup,"" Myers said Tuesday. ""I think it lengthens the lineup for us, makes everyone around us better. ... Anytime you can add a player of that caliber to your team, you do it.""
Manny Machado has signed the second-largest total value contract in MLB history, behind Giancarlo Stanton's $325 million extension with the Marlins in the 2014-15 offseason.
The Padres have spent $474 million in free agency the past two seasons -- tops in the majors. San Diego had spent a combined $309 million in free agency in the previous 25 seasons, which ranked 27th in the majors.
ESPN's Keith Law ranked the Padres' farm system as the best in baseball entering this season.
Machado's signing immediately registered with oddsmakers, as the Padres' chances to win the World Series improved from 80-1 to 50-1 at the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook on Tuesday. In addition, their season win total at the SuperBook jumped from 76.5 to 78.5, and their chances to win the National League West title improved from 30-1 to 12-1.
The Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees had been considered in the running to sign Machado.
Tim Kurkjian reflects on Manny Machado's amazing skill set and his on-field controversies as he joins the Padres on a $300 million contract.
White Sox executive vice president Kenny Williams told reporters on Tuesday that he was shocked that Machado chose the Padres.
""I'm wearing my shades, so you can't see the shock in my eyes,"" Williams told reporters at White Sox spring training in Glendale, Arizona. ""Very surprised. There are a few other words you could put on that, but still in a little bit of disbelief. ... I honestly believe we had the best offer on the table.""
The White Sox's final offer to Machado was for eight years and $250 million, sources said. It included a pair of club options based on plate appearances that could have brought the value of the package to $320 million.
Had Machado stayed healthy throughout the deal, the likelihood is Chicago's offer would've been worth around $340 million. Machado instead opted for the guaranteed money from San Diego.
Machado spent most of this past season at shortstop, his preferred position, and produced the third-worst Defensive Runs Saved total (minus-13) among the 22 players with enough innings to qualify at that spot. He played better at the position upon joining the Dodgers, who gave up five minor leaguers to acquire him from the Orioles on July 18, but his 15-week stint in L.A. was tumultuous.
The former No. 3 overall pick drew criticism for loafing up the first-base line, then fanned the flames when he told Fox Sports during the postseason that hustling is ""not my cup of tea.""

I think there are other times where guys do it, and they really do care. And by care, I mean the effort they put into their work, the type of teammate they are, and Manny checks all those boxes.""
Machado had several big moments with the Dodgers, some while the team was fighting for a sixth consecutive division title in September and a few more during a victorious National League Championship Series. But he hit just .182 in the World Series, and he made the final out as the Boston Red Sox won the championship.
""There's not that many guys that get to free agency at that superstar level that are 26 years old,"" Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw said Tuesday. ""Ten years seems fair, for sure, and getting that $30 [million per] year is great.

Machado was limited to 82 games in 2014, but he has played at least 156 games in each of the past four seasons. He has hit at least 30 home runs and 30 doubles in each of those four seasons, making him one of just two players, along with Colorado's Nolan Arenado, to reach both of those marks every season since 2015.
He has compiled 29 FanGraphs wins above replacement since his first full season in the majors in 2013, tied with Joey Votto for sixth among position players since then. Only Mike Trout, Josh Donaldson, Paul Goldschmidt, Mookie Betts and Jose Altuve have a higher WAR in that six-year stretch.
Machado's 175 career home runs are 12 more than that of the Padres' all-time franchise leader, Nate Colbert, who hit 163 -- the lowest total for any active franchise.

Mize, the No. 1 selection in last year's draft, was assigned to minor league camp by the Tigers on Tuesday. He gave Detroit fans a glimpse of his possible future on Monday, when he pitched two innings against St. Louis. Mize struck out the first two batters of a 1-2-3 seventh, then allowed a run in the eighth after walking two.
Mize went 10-6 with a 3.30 ERA in 17 starts at Auburn last year . He made four starts in the minors across the Rookie and Class A levels.
Last month, Mize pitched two innings for the Tigers in a game against Southeastern University, allowing three hits and a run and striking out two. He came in last week against the New York Yankees and allowed a hit before the game was called because of rain.
He looked impressive at the start of his outing against the Cardinals. Kolten Wong, a veteran infielder who had homered earlier in the game, was one of Mize's strikeout victims.
Now Mize heads to minor league camp, where it should be easier for the team to get him the work he needs.
""They need to go pitch, get innings. We've got so many people here,"" Gardenhire said. ""When they start throwing four and five innings, the starters, that's less innings we can get people.""
Gardenhire said he told Mize that he's on a great track.
""Don't try to throw 98 if you can throw 95. Just be within yourself,"" Gardenhire said. ""You don't even have to tell that kid that. He's on a mission. He's going to push the envelope on our bosses here, because he's going to be a fast-track guy. He's got stuff. He's got major league stuff.""

How they got him: On Dec. 5, St. Louis sent Luke Weaver, Carson Kelly, Andy Young and a draft pick to Arizona in a blockbuster trade for the star first baseman.
What to expect: A star in St. Louis. Goldschmidt's move might not have had the fanfare of the Bryce and Manny watch, but there is a case to be made that the six-time All-Star is the best player who changed teams this winter. The 31-year-old slugger has finished in the top three of NL MVP voting three times during his career, and another big season on a bigger stage in St. Louis could help Goldy win some hardware.
New team: New York Mets
How they got them: New Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen took advantage of Seattle's fire sale, netting the second baseman and closer from the Mariners in a win-now deal that cost New York prospects Jarred Kelenic and Justin Dunn.
From watching stars take the field in new places to the first chance to see top prospects, it's time to get ready for Opening Day. Watch on ESPN+
Upcoming schedule:
1 p.m. ET Thursday: Miami Marlins at Houston Astros
8 p.m. ET Friday: San Diego Padres at Los Angeles Dodgers
What to expect: Cano posted a .303/.374/.471 slash line during a 2018 season cut in half by an 80-game suspension for a violation of MLB's performance-enhancing drugs policy. He batted .317 in 41 games after returning from the suspension and should give the Mets a needed offensive boost in the infield.
Diaz will undoubtedly bring electricity to the ninth inning at Citi Field. Armed with a high-90s fastball and a filthy hard slider, the closer struck out 124 batters in 73⅓ innings on his way to a 57-save 2018 and could be the best closer in his new league this year.
New team: Cincinnati Reds
How they got him: Cincinnati landed Puig along with Matt Kemp and Alex Wood from the Dodgers in a seven-player deal in which L.A. sought to change its salary structure and the Reds focused on bringing in veterans to help the team climb out of the NL Central cellar.
What to expect: Puig being Puig. Playing in a new home in a contract year will provide plenty of motivation for the outfielder, but the big question remains: Can Puig finally put it all together for an entire season?
New team: Washington Nationals
How they got him: The Nationals outbid a host of suitors for the most coveted starter on the free-agent market by handing out a six-year, $140 million deal that gives Washington a three-ace rotation featuring Corbin alongside Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg.
How do the best at each position rank and what tier of production do they fit in?
Positions: First basemen | Third basemen | Outfielders | Starting pitchers
What to expect: The 29-year-old left-hander rode his devastating slider to a breakout 2018 that culminated with a top-five finish for NL Cy Young honors, and there's no reason to expect anything less in 2019. If Scherzer, Corbin and Strasburg all deliver, a bounce-back season is likely for the Nats -- with or without Bryce Harper.
New team: Atlanta Braves
How they got him: A lifelong Braves fan growing up in Alabama, Donaldson bet on himself by taking a one-year, $23 million deal with Atlanta early in the offseason instead of searching for a multiyear offer.
What to expect: Injuries have limited Donaldson over the past two seasons, but he still has been effective when he's been able to take the field. Small sample size alert: In a short stint with the Indians last season, Donaldson put up a .280/.400/.507 slash line that topped his career marks in all three categories.
New team: Houston Astros
How they got him: The sweet-swinging outfielder inked a two-year, $32 million contract to join the Astros in December.
What to expect: Another potent bat in an already-deep Houston lineup. An All-Star each of the past two seasons, Brantley is a shoo-in to hit .300 with some pop as long as he can stay healthy after an injury-plagued finish to his time with the Indians.
New team: Philadelphia Phillies
How they got him: By including pitching prospect Sixto Sanchez in a package for Realmuto, the Phillies convinced the Marlins to trade the All-Star catcher within the NL East during an offseason that also saw Philadelphia add Andrew McCutchen and Jean Segura to its lineup.
What to expect: While getting a likely All-Star starter is certainly an upgrade, Philadelphia's offseason will be judged by whether adding Realmuto is the final big splash or the move before bringing a certain outfielder to Citizens Bank Park. Either way, Realmuto will provide a big boost at the catcher position with the potential to blow past his career high of 21 home runs now that he's playing in a much more hitter-friendly ballpark.
The long offseason wait is over -- let the games begin! -- giving us a chance to focus on what will happen between the lines.
The Nationals have had plenty of time to get used to the idea of playing without Bryce Harper -- and it shows at their camp in Florida.
Some teams take a stars-and-scrubs approach, some have depth but lack star power. We sort them all out and figure out who's on top.
New team: Los Angeles Dodgers
How they got him: After clearing space in the outfield by trading away Puig and Kemp, the Dodgers brought in Pollock on a four-year, $55 million deal.
What to expect: When he plays, Pollock is an All-Star-caliber center fielder who contributes in every phase of the game. Staying healthy has been an issue, though, for a guy who hasn't played in more than 115 games since 2015 and has eclipsed 450 at-bats only once in his career.
New team: New York Yankees
How they got him: In need of a rotation upgrade, the Yankees parted with prospect Justus Sheffield and two other minor leaguers to land Paxton from the Mariners on Nov. 19.
What to expect: Best known for either his 2018 no-hitter or having a bald eagle land on him during the national anthem last season, Paxton will get a chance to show his stuff on the big stage at Yankee Stadium this year. The 30-year-old lefty has had injury troubles throughout his career but has the stuff to dominate in any park and has struck out more than a batter per inning over the course of his career.
New team: Los Angeles Angels
How they got him: Harvey signed a one-year, $11 million contract -- with incentives that could push it to $14 million -- on Dec. 21.
What to expect: After his time with the Mets came to an end last May, Harvey showed signs of bouncing back during a four-month stint with the Reds. His 4.50 ERA and 7.8 strikeouts per nine innings with Cincinnati provide a realistic expectation for Harvey going forward, even if it is a far cry from his Dark Knight production earlier in the decade.
New team: Seattle Mariners
How they got him: After being posted by the Seibu Lions of Japan early in the offseason, Kikuchi signed an interesting contract with the Mariners that guarantees $56 million and could be worth as much as $109 million. His pact with Seattle starts with a base deal for $43 million over the next three seasons. Following the 2021 season, the team can trigger a four-year, $66 million extension. If the Mariners decline the extension, Kikuchi can either pick up a $13 million option for 2022 or become a free agent.
What to expect: We shall see. While Kikuchi doesn't have the hype Yu Darvish or Shohei Ohtani had when coming to the majors, he has shown an ability to dominate in the NBP but also battled shoulder problems. In 2017, the left-hander used a high-90s fastball to lead the Pacific League in ERA and finish second in strikeouts.
"
26195127,"Nola received a four-year, $45 million contract last month. The contract includes a 2023 club option that could make the deal worth $56.75 million over five years.
The 25-year-old right-hander is 41-28 in four seasons, including 17-6 last year with a 2.37 ERA and 0.975 WHIP. He finished third in the National League Cy Young Award voting behind Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer.

26262803,"Major League Baseball's first game in London, featuring the World Series champion Boston Red Sox and rival New York Yankees, is the best-selling game of the 2019 regular season, ticket seller StubHub said on Thursday.
It may be just over a year until Europe gets its first taste of Major League Baseball, but as the Boston Red Sox's double-header with the New York Yankees was confirmed in a small central London cinema, the message from the powers that be was resolute.
Premium seats at London's Olympic Stadium will cost $493 for the games between the New York Yankees and World Series champion Boston Red Sox on June 29 and 30.
Following matchups in Mexico and Japan in recent years, the league is making its first foray into Europe with hopes of expanding its international reach with the help of its two most-storied franchises.
Fans from 44 different states in the U.S. and 27 different countries have already purchased tickets for the MLB London series, according to StubHub general manager Jill Krimmel.
""The appeal of MLB to a global audience continues to grow, and the overwhelming response for the rivalry matchup between the Yankees and Red Sox in London certainly proves that the sport has fans worldwide,"" Krimmel said.
""It is demonstrating that baseball has tremendous potential overseas, much like the NFL and NBA have seen.""
The Yankees are driving demand stateside, outselling the Red Sox by 18 percent.
The Philadelphia Phillies have seen a surge in ticket sales following the acquisition of slugger Bryce Harper, who signed a record 13-year, $330 million contract.
Phillies' ticket sales are up 93 percent from the same time last year and up 157 percent over the last three seasons, the highest three-year growth out of all the teams in the league.
MLB's Opening Day is March 28. The London Series takes place at the Olympic Stadium over two days, June 29-30.
Tickets for the London Series sold out in December, but the MLB announced on Thursday that a further 5,000 tickets will be released across the two games due to an increase in capacity at the London Stadium.
The stadium, which was built for the 2012 Olympic Games and is now home to Premier League soccer team West Ham United, will see its capacity increase from 55,000 to around 57,500.
West Ham have averaged a home attendance of 57,902 during the 2018-19 Premier League season.

26031704,"Former Los Angeles Dodgers pitching great Don Newcombe has died after a lengthy illness, the team announced Tuesday. He was 92.
""Don Newcombe's presence and life established him as a role model for major leaguers across the country,"" Dodgers president Stan Kasten said in a statement. ""He was a constant presence at Dodger Stadium and players always gravitated toward him for his endless advice and friendship. The Dodgers meant everything to him and we are all fortunate he was a part of our lives.""
Newcombe, one of the first African-American pitchers in MLB, joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1949, winning Rookie of the Year while helping the team win the NL pennant.
In Newcombe's debut season, he and Dodgers teammates Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella became three of the first four African-Americans (along with Cleveland outfielder Larry Doby) to appear in an All-Star Game.
After a break to serve in the military during the 1952 and '53 seasons, he returned, and with the likes of Robinson, Campanella, Duke Snider, Gil Hodges and Pee Wee Reese, helped create a World Series champion.
The Dodgers won it all in 1955, and Newcombe went 20-5 with a 3.20 ERA to help get them there.
""Don Newcombe had a ton of talent and he was a great competitor,"" Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda said in a statement. ""He was a helluva player, and he was one of the best hitting pitchers I have ever seen.""
Newcombe's best season came in 1956, when he led the league with 27 wins and won the Cy Young and MVP awards and led the Dodgers to another NL pennant. But the Dodgers lost the Series to the Yankees in seven games, and Newcombe dropped the deciding contest, giving up two home runs to Yogi Berra.
He never reached the same lofty heights again. After an 0-6 start to the 1958 season (the organization's first in Los Angeles), he was traded to the Reds. He won 13 games in 1959 but only six split between Cincinnati and Cleveland in 1960, his last season.
""Don was a mentor at first, a friend at the end,"" said Dodgers legend Sandy Koufax. ""He will be missed by anyone who got to know him.""
After he retired, Newcombe revealed that a drinking problem contributed to the downfall of his career. In the mid-1960s he became sober and worked with various organizations to help curb teenage drinking.
""Don was admired by Dr. Martin Luther King and he was a big champion in the fight for equality along with Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella,"" longtime Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully said in a statement. ""The former 27-game winner was an even bigger winner when he overcame his battle with alcoholism and helped others whenever he could. He truly was a big man on and off the field and he will be missed by all.""
Newcombe finished his 10-year MLB career as a four-time All-Star with a 149-90 record and 3.56 ERA.
The New Jersey native began his professional career in the Negro Leagues in 1944.
""Anytime you lose somebody that you know is a sad thing. But he lived a pretty incredible life, great story, a pioneer for a lot of different things in baseball,"" said Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw. ""Just getting to know him over the years, great man, and he'll be missed, for sure.
""The Dodger uniform meant a lot to him. Before he got older and traveling was tough, he used to speak to us every spring training. You could just tell what it meant to him.""

26024155,"When Patrick Corbin signed with the Washington Nationals back on Dec. 7 for $140 million over six years, it didn't seem that anomalous. Sure, it was relatively early in the hot stove cycle. Yes, a six-year contract for a 29-year-old hurler with a Tommy John surgery on his résumé might have been a little on the lengthy side. But all in all, based on historical norms, the deal was within reason. Two months later, with a stagnant market turning free agents into freeze agents, Corbin's pact sticks out like a sore thumb with a Day-Glo thimble on it.
Just how conspicuous is Corbin's contract? His $140 million is more than twice the amount Red Sox hurler Nathan Eovaldi, who signed the second-richest contract of any free agent this offseason (four years, $67.5 million). In fact, it's more than the value of the next three largest free-agent deals combined. It's also $140 million more than Dallas Keuchel has gotten so far (the former Cy Young winner is still up for grabs). All of which raises the question, how exactly did Patrick Corbin win the winter?
As winter bleeds into spring, here's how the free-agent landscape looks right now.

• Miller: Welcome to a small-market team's worst nightmare »
• Olney: The next Aaron Nola? These stars could look to cash in now  (ESPN+) »
• Gonzalez: How Dodgers' clubhouse embodies baseball's free-agency concerns »
It all started with a canceled honeymoon. After getting married at the Mountain Shadows Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Nov. 17, Corbin and his new bride, Jen, were planning on celebrating with a jaunt to Puerto Vallarta. But the business of being a free agent -- the top starter on the market, to be exact -- got in the way. It happened quickly.
The Phillies, whose owner made headlines in November when he talked about spending ""stupid money"" this offseason, came a-courtin'. So too did the Nationals, a franchise whose recent success has been fueled by a seemingly unquenchable thirst for elite starting pitching. The Yankees, who had obvious holes in the rotation and whom Corbin rooted for as a child growing up in Syracuse, were also firmly in the mix.
Although Corbin says he enjoyed his visits with all three of his primary East Coast suitors, it was his trip to D.C. that stood out. For openers, as soon as his quintet -- the pitcher, his wife, agent John Courtright, Nats GM Mike Rizzo and owner Mark Lerner -- entered Fiola Mare, a swanky Georgetown seafood spot, they found themselves getting frisked and wanded because Vice President Mike Pence happened to be dining in the back room.
""That was kind of different,"" Corbin said.
But the most unique thing about that dinner meeting was the straightforward manner in which Rizzo and Lerner communicated their interest. Over a symphony of food and drink that included oysters and pinot noir and tiramisu, the two men held court at the circular five-top and refused to be coy, as has become the custom in MLB front offices these past couple of years. Instead, they presented the franchise's one-year, three-year, and five-year plans. They discussed neighborhoods and school systems with the newlyweds. The fact that the owner of the team was at the table spoke volumes. ""We were trying to impress,"" Rizzo said. ""We know no other way.""
It's an M.O. that's all but lost in the polar vortex that is today's MLB marketplace. As one veteran agent put it: ""The problem the last two years in free agency is that let's say you have Babe Ruth. You could call darn near every team and it would be like holding a gun to somebody's head to get a GM to say, 'Hey, you know what? Your guy Babe is pretty good. I like him.' What you would hear is, 'Well, you know what, the way we look at it, there's like six Babe Ruths out there.'""
The top outfielder on the free-agent market is set to make big bucks. We put you in Bryce Harper's shoes. Where will you go?
Washington reeled in a big-name free agent while the star outfielder is still on the market. Here's what the addition of Patrick Corbin means for Bryce Harper's chances of returning.
Small-market teams aren't watching rich teams sign all the top free agents anymore. They're watching rich teams sign all the top free agents -- at discounts.
In Corbin's case, going full blast after their No. 1 target meant adding a sixth year to the deal, something the Phillies and Yankees weren't willing to do. Neither were the Angels, who originally drafted Corbin and were also in on the southpaw. Not that anyone could blame those clubs: Before last season, when Corbin posted a career high in strikeouts, a career low in WHIP, and finished fifth in the Cy Young voting, the jury was still out on him. In 2013, the former second-round pick was an All-Star with Arizona. But the year after that, he underwent Tommy John surgery and missed the whole season. Two years after that, in 2016, he struggled so much he was banished to the D-backs' bullpen. Even including his monster 2018 campaign, the three pitchers Corbin is most similar to at this point in his career, according to Baseball-Reference.com, are -- wait for it -- Jon Niese, George Stone and Erik Hanson.
Nevertheless, the Nationals, coming off a deeply disappointing season and convinced the 2018 vintage of Corbin -- the one who ratcheted up his slider usage beyond 40 percent and introduced a slow curveball -- was not a mirage, put on the full-court press. Just like they did in January 2015, when they gave Max Scherzer $210 million to be their ace, even though their rotation had been the best in baseball the previous season. Because, as Rizzo is fond of saying, you can never have too much starting pitching. It worked.
""It just felt like the Nationals wanted me the most,"" Corbin said as he stood in front of his locker at the Nationals' spring training complex in West Palm Beach, Florida. ""And I think they showed it by adding that sixth year and coming after me aggressively.""
It didn't hurt that when the Corbins returned to the Four Seasons after dinner that night, they bumped into Nats cornerstone Ryan Zimmerman and his wife, Heather, who just so happened to be out on a date at the hotel's steakhouse. Zimmerman, who has spent his entire 14-year career in Washington, didn't give Corbin the hard sell -- instead he told the hurler to ignore the money and just pick the place that felt most comfortable. Meanwhile, Heather and Jen chatted about what it's like living in the D.C. area. The couples chatted in the lobby for half an hour. Before they parted, the players exchanged phone numbers. The next day, news broke that Corbin and the Nationals had reached an agreement.
Two days after that, Corbin sat on a podium at Nats Park, with Rizzo by his side and Lerner seated in the front row. Scherzer and Zimmerman were in attendance too, along with starter Stephen Strasburg and new catcher Yan Gomes. ""I'm excited to join the ballclub and be a part of something special,"" Corbin said. ""Just excited to join the guys and glad I'm part of the family.""

Right then and there, it was clear the Nats had won Corbin's heart. And he'd won theirs. But that's not all Corbin won. Two months later, when spring training began and dozens of free agents were still flapping in the breeze -- including Harper and Machado -- and with no other offseason contract coming even remotely close to Corbin's, it became abundantly clear he'd won the winter.
As glorious as that may sound, perhaps it's a dual-edged sword. The whole ""with great power comes great responsibility"" thing. Even in ordinary times, a $140 million contract carries with it the pressure to perform, to justify. But these are not ordinary times. And so maybe that same $140 million contract -- the one that dwarfed every other deal that has been consummated over the past three and a half months -- carries with it even more pressure. Then again, maybe not.
""I don't feel any different coming in here,"" said Corbin, whom Nats manager Davey Martinez has described as the consummate professional and very intense. ""It's like a normal offseason. Only thing is, new teammates, and a new staff that I'm trying to get familiar with. I'm just going to try to get ready for the season and try to get better. But I don't feel any different really.""
Of course, whatever pressure Corbin might have felt is probably more than offset by the soft landing that is having Scherzer and Strasburg ahead of him in the Washington rotation. Indeed, being the most highly paid No. 3 starter in all the land does have its perks.
""That was a big key for us to come here,"" Corbin said of Scherzer and Strasburg. ""You have to have good starting pitching to win. They're the best in the game. I get to watch them every day and try to get better.""
In the meantime, Corbin is adjusting to the new normal. He and Jen haven't bought a home yet, instead opting to rent for a year while they figure out the lay of the land in the District. Almost comically frugal in the past -- the car he bought in 2010 after receiving a $450,000 signing bonus was a used one, and he lived with his parents after his rookie season -- Corbin has learned to let it loose a little. Especially when it comes to restaurants.
""We're foodies,"" he said before going off on a tangent about how he's actually the spender in the family. ""I have to tell her to go and get stuff sometimes,"" he said of his wife, then noted how she recently came home bragging she'd just bought a $175 pair of jeans. ""That's the first time she's ever done that.""
It probably won't be the last. Because that's how it goes when you win the winter.

26002896,"Here's where the free agency of the 26-year-olds stands: in the same ZIP code it did 105 days ago, when the entire process began. Three and a half months of teases, fake rumors created to gin up retweets, social-media red herrings and dissatisfaction over a process that grows more tired by the day.
The problem, of course, is that there is no incentive to end the stalemate between ...
1. Manny Machado and Bryce Harper and the teams that want to sign them. What it comes down to is a simple calculus, sources involved with the pursuit of the players told ESPN -- one that doesn't in any way lessen the frustration over the standoff but at least can go a long way toward explaining it.
On one side are Machado and Harper. The former is a four-time All-Star coming off arguably the best season of his career. The latter is a one-time MVP with a career .900 OPS and the most marketability of any active player. Both want $300 million-plus contracts. Neither seems particularly inclined to budge from that floor. Given the game's annual revenues, which hover around $10 billion, their production, their age and past precedent, the $300 million-plus ask is by no means outlandish.
On the other side are the teams. They see the state of play in baseball. The longer teams have waited to sign players, the more players have accepted deals below what they expected at the beginning of the winter. It tends to work, preying on all kinds of potential vulnerabilities -- the desire not to miss spring training or time with new teammates, familial pressure, fear of the unknown -- to force players into uncomfortable decisions. This strategy is not limited to midlevel sorts, either. The vise is real even on the crème de la crème.
Other factors further complicate the matter. Machado's agent, Dan Lozano, and Harper's agent, Scott Boras, don't like each other. It's not exactly that neither wants his client to sign first, but there is certainly a strategic element involved. Whether it's Machado or Harper who goes first, the one left over can leverage all of the interested teams against one another to create a bidding war. A savvy team could pinpoint its target, jump the market and sign one of the two, but the fear among those teams is overpaying or, worse yet, bidding against itself.
Lozano and Boras continue to project positions of strength with teams, according to executives involved in the pursuit of Machado and Harper. If the market has collapsed, the agents are showing no signs of it. What's likelier, two executives admitted, is that teams in the end may not pay full retail but certainly won't get either player for wholesale, either.
Would that be enough for ...
2. Justin Verlander and a brigade of other players to end their public grousing on the health of the free-agent market? Probably not.
One part of their messaging is hitting home: More and more players, in speaking out on the matter, are saying there are more than 100 jobless free agents. This is not true. A liberal accounting of the so-called XX(B) free agents -- ones who have six-plus years of service -- counts about 50. Of those 50, about half are clearly major-league-caliber players. A few come with enough warts to straddle the line between a big league deal and a minor league deal. The rest will get non-roster invitations to camp.
Look, 100 jobless free agents is a sexy talking point. It works. For an organization like the players' association, which has struggled with messaging, the widespread adoption of the 100-jobless-free-agents narrative is promising, especially when the message is spread in such a scattershot fashion, with Verlander's tweet the latest among this new oeuvre of player communication.
The problem is, it's not real, and when players resort to exaggerating to make a point that needs no exaggeration -- 25 legitimate big leaguers without major league deals as spring training begins is indicative of a problem -- it sets them up as boys who cried wolf. Which is a shame, seeing as their main talking point should carry a serious wallop.
The way free agency is going, the rush to sign early-bird contract extensions could become the norm. But at what cost?
An up-and-coming star, an aging veteran and a recent signee all agree that this offseason has been unsettling.
The catcher couldn't wait to get to spring training, and his new team couldn't wait to have him. Now the question is if an even bigger name will sign on to complete one of MLB's most intriguing makeovers.
Sixty percent of baseball teams are carrying payrolls $50 million below the $206 million luxury-tax threshold. Just shy of half the teams in the game are $75 million below. Eight teams are more than $100 million under the threshold. More than a quarter of the game isn't even spending half of what it can before incurring a penalty that barely penalizes anyway. It's one thing for the highest-spending teams not to exceed the luxury tax. It's another for the teams that receive tens of millions in revenue-sharing dollars to practically sit out offseasons.
So, yes, it is troublesome that Machado and Harper and Dallas Keuchel and Marwin Gonzalez and Mike Moustakas and Gio Gonzalez and Adam Jones and Josh Harrison and Clay Buchholz and Jose Iglesias and Martin Maldonado and Carlos Gonzalez and Tyler Clippard and Evan Gattis and Denard Span and Edwin Jackson and Derek Dietrich and Adam Warren and Tony Sipp and Matt Wieters and Carlos Gomez don't have jobs. They could be ...
3. Craig Kimbrel and have entered the winter telling teams he wanted a six-year deal. That never came close to materializing. Kimbrel's winter has been a perfect storm of awfulness. Bad October. Draft-pick penalty for the team that signs him because Kimbrel turned down the one-year, $17.9 million qualifying offer. Understandable ask based on his history, but risky considering how teams today view closers. No clear fallback.
The Boston Red Sox make sense in almost every regard. He helped them win a World Series. Kimbrel put up a 2.44 ERA and struck out 305 in 184⅓ innings over three seasons for them. Most of all, the defending World Series winners' closing options consist of Matt Barnes, Ryan Brasier and a host of others who have not regularly pitched high-leverage ninth innings.
Here's where they don't make sense: Because the Red Sox are nearing the third threshold of the luxury tax -- their payroll is around $240 million, and the next tax level hits at $246 million -- the price of Kimbrel would be unreasonable, even for a team like Boston that clearly does not hesitate to spend.
Say Kimbrel wants a deal that averages around $17 million a year. That's what Wade Davis and Aroldis Chapman got. Boston pays a base tax of 30 percent on every dollar over the first threshold of $206 million and an additional 12 percent surtax on every dollar from $226 million to $246 million. Anything that takes them past the $246 million mark gets taxed 75 percent total.
So assuming the Red Sox are at $240 million, the first $6 million of a theoretical Kimbrel deal would cost about $2.5 million in taxes. And on the $11 million, Boston would pay an additional $8.25 million. In other words, a $17 million-a-year Craig Kimbrel deal for the Red Sox would cost them $27.75 million this year -- or a smooth three-quarters of a million more than the New York Yankees paid reliever Adam Ottavino for three years.
Look, Boston could say: ""We won the World Series last year. We're flush with cash. Let's do it."" But the Red Sox didn't earn that championship through a lack of discipline. It's why Kimbrel -- or ...
4. Dallas Keuchel for that matter -- makes plenty of sense for the Atlanta Braves: They do not have any luxury-tax penalties to worry about. Atlanta is one of those teams more than $75 million under the lowest threshold. With a new stadium and a rabid fan base, Atlanta is in prime position to strike after winning the NL East last season.
The Braves' strikes this winter have been more tactical and reserved than their opponents'. The Washington Nationals signed Patrick Corbin to a $140 million deal. The Philadelphia Phillies spent on talent (Andrew McCutchen, David Robertson) and traded for more (J.T. Realmuto, Jean Segura). The New York Mets overhauled their roster. Aside from signing Josh Donaldson, the Braves more or less look the same.
Kimbrel's potential return to Atlanta probably makes more sense than Keuchel going there, especially with an excess of young, electric starters in the Braves organization. Kimbrel spent his first five seasons in Atlanta. The Braves could use some stability in the closer role, held currently by the talented but often-erratic Arodys Vizcaino.
Atlanta has proved its affinity for short-term deals. Kimbrel may ultimately be resigned to taking one. It's a marriage that, on the surface, makes plenty of sense. Sort of like ...
5. Jacob deGrom and the New York Mets. In the coming weeks, deGrom's current agents are expected to start negotiations with his former agent, Brodie Van Wagenen, who happens to be the Mets' current GM. The awkwardness is clear: Six months ago, Van Wagenen was intent on squeezing every last penny from the Mets. Now his job is to pinch them for the team.
There is a distinct possibility the discussions go nowhere, with the rift of free agency manifesting itself in extension talks. Clearly deGrom's performance makes a compelling case. Through nearly 900 innings, his career ERA is 2.67. He is coming off a Cy Young-winning season. The Mets adore him personally. As they lean into contention, they do so with him squarely atop their rotation.
He's 37 and throwing 99. Baseball's best comeback story will be playing out during spring training. Jeff Passan »
On the other hand, deGrom turns 31 this year, is a decade removed from Tommy John surgery and has two seasons of team control remaining, which doesn't exactly scream urgency, particularly with deGrom on Thursday declining to leverage the Mets by threatening to cut off further negotiations until after the 2020 season, unless he has an extension by Opening Day. Further, Phillies ace Aaron Nola just signed a four-year, $45 million deal that can reach $56.75 million with a club option. Nola is five years younger than deGrom and was due to hit free agency only a year after him.
While deGrom's $17 million salary this season places him in something of a different financial stratosphere than Nola, it's still a comparable the Mets are certain to bring up. Signing a player long term? Not the Mets' style. Signing a player for large dollars? Not the Mets' style, either. Doing both? Really not the Mets' style.
This is not to be all Debbie Downer about extension talks. It's more to remind that for all the talk about the Mets locking up deGrom, there is a giant chasm to bridge, lest he be more like ...
6. Trevor Bauer, who doesn't want a long-term deal. After winning an arbitration case against the Cleveland Indians for the second consecutive year, Bauer lamented what he felt were personal insults lobbed at him during the hearing but more important affirmed his previously stated commitment to never sign a multiyear deal.
Yes, Bauer wants to be a baseball mercenary. He wants to use teams' affinity for one-year contracts and coax the most money possible out of them. He believes enough in his training program and arm health to feel he can avoid the sort of injury that makes long-term deals so intriguing to players.
The ultimate goal, he hopes, is that a team allows him to start every fourth day. Bauer believes he can make 40-plus starts per season, and while that would entail the sort of rotation rejiggering that would tighten the market of interested teams, those who have bred flexibility into their pitchers -- the Tampa Bay Rays' opener-heavy 2018 provides the guidebook to doing so -- could make it work.
Bauer isn't a free agent until 2020, and most of his peers don't share his appetite for risk -- or change -- even if the philosophy behind it is sound. Just look at ...
7. Nolan Arenado, who would be locked up by the Colorado Rockies now were he content with a seven-year contract. The Rockies are loath to go beyond that number, which would lock up Arenado through his age-35 season, even though their deal last year with outfielder Charlie Blackmon holds onto him through his 36th birthday.
The possibility of an extension for Arenado remains, though it's not nearly the cinch owner Dick Monfort made it out to be when he told reporters the sides were ""to the finals"" after they settled on a one-year, $26 million deal for Arenado's final season before free agency.
While markets clearly change -- at this point last year, Machado and Harper were no-brainer options for at least half the teams in baseball -- the love for Arenado is shared far and wide in front offices around the game. The free-agent class of 2019-20 looks strong on paper too, headlined by Arenado, third baseman Anthony Rendon, starters Gerrit Cole, Chris Sale and Madison Bumgarner, first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, shortstop Xander Bogaerts, outfielder Khris Davis and plenty more (Didi Gregorius, Miles Mikolas, Zack Wheeler, Scooter Gennett, Aaron Hicks, Donaldson).
The Rockies' aggressiveness isn't limited to Arenado. They've discussed potential long-term deals with a number of their young starters, though none have bitten yet. Oftentimes it takes a year from those first conversations to contracts being agreed upon. Last year around this time ...
8. Max Kepler and Jorge Polanco turned down deals from the Minnesota Twins, as did pitcher Jose Berrios and outfielder Byron Buxton. On Thursday, Kepler and Polanco finalized extensions, with the former getting $35 million over five years with one club option and the latter $25.75 million for five years with a pair of club options.
Each deal bought out a potential three years of free agency and highlighted what's becoming something of a trend this spring: young players forgoing free-agent years for the allure of guaranteed money. Frustration isn't the only emotion the substandard free-agent markets of the past two winters have caused players. There's fear, too. And that fear is reflected in the extensions of Nola, Kepler and Polanco.

9. Vladimir Guerrero Jr.  is about to go through and wonder: How is this a system that works for both parties? Guerrero, for those who haven't heard, may be the best pure hitter to emerge in the minor leagues since Miguel Cabrera. He's got the pedigree and precociousness of his Hall of Fame father, and a half-dozen scouts who saw him in Double-A and Triple-A last season agreed: He could hit, and hit well, in the major leagues right now.
The likelihood of him being there on Opening Day with the Toronto Blue Jays, however, is minuscule. Why? The collective bargaining agreement incentivizes teams from breaking camp with rookies who deserve to be in the major leagues.
Here's why: There are 186 days on the major league calendar in 2019. A year of service takes 172 days in the major leagues. Teams control a player's rights for six full years. All a team needs to do is keep a player in the minor leagues for 15 days, and it can get almost an entire extra year of the player without exposing him to free agency.
If the Blue Jays wait until April 12 to purchase Guerrero's contract, he will not be a free agent until after the 2025 season. If he breaks camp with the Blue Jays and stays with them all year, he would be a free agent following 2024. Thus, all Toronto needs to do is come up with an excuse to start Guerrero at Triple-A Buffalo -- where he hit .336/.414/.564 after slashing .402/.449/.671 in Double-A -- and there's not much the players' association can do about it.
Already the Blue Jays have started girding for sending Guerrero down. General manager Ross Atkins told reporters Thursday that ""there is no firm timeline on when he arrives and when he is playing in Toronto for the first time. But we want to make sure he's the best possible third baseman, best possible hitter he can be.""
Translation: The kid ain't gonna be at Rogers Centre on March 28. Mark your calendar, instead, for April 12, which is the 16th day of the season. Hopefully by then ...
10. Manny Machado and Bryce Harper will be wearing major league uniforms too. The notion of them holding out until April, while not explicitly threatened yet, is not entirely unrealistic, either. It's true: All it takes is one team to look at its roster, its opponents -- anything, really -- and say that it's time to pony up.
The Padres' involvement with Machado is an example of that. Two sources said they are enamored with him and would love to build around Machado as their huge wave of minor league talent begins its ascent to the major leagues. Another source cautioned: After spending $140 million on Eric Hosmer last year, do the Padres really have $300 million to give Machado?
Theoretically, sure. The Padres are profitable. They've got only two players under contract beyond 2020: Hosmer and Wil Myers. The incentive is clear, and it would send quite a message: that if the Padres, whose market size ranks 27th of the 30 major league teams, are willing to throw around potential record cash in free agency, surely others can. Even San Diego's flirtation with the idea should be enough.
As winter bleeds into spring, here's how the free-agent landscape looks right now.

• Miller: Welcome to a small-market team's worst nightmare »
• Olney: The next Aaron Nola? These stars could look to cash in now  (ESPN+) »
• Gonzalez: How Dodgers' clubhouse embodies baseball's free-agency concerns »
It's not as if Machado's and Harper's markets are vacant. The Philadelphia Phillies remain in on both. So do the Chicago White Sox. The San Francisco Giants and Washington Nationals have expressed interest in Harper, and the New York Yankees with Machado. Surely there are others whose back channeling has not been made public.
Still, no offer has been strong enough to thaw the impasse that is both microcosm and manifestation of the labor unrest percolating in the game. As easy as it would be to lose faith in a marketplace that has treated them so well so many times, Lozano and Boras still believe in market forces enough to wait -- to convince their clients, both of whom want to be in a uniform this week, that patience isn't a virtue, it's the only virtue.
Two can play at that game, counter the teams, and they're right. Two are playing at that game, and it's only fair, even if it helped turn baseball's bustling offseason into a single, tired question that's asked by people around the game: Where are Bryce and Manny going?
The answer will come. The broken record will spin again. And it can't happen soon enough.

26047865,"Former Dodgers great Don Newcombe has died at the age of 92, the team announced.
Newcombe died Tuesday at 92.
The team said Thursday that Newcombe will be saluted in pregame ceremonies on April 27, when he is inducted into the Legends of Dodger Baseball. He will also have a commemorative bobblehead.
Newcombe, along with Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella, helped pave the way for blacks to play in the major leagues. He won the Cy Young and National League Most Valuable Player awards in 1956 with the Dodgers. He was 27-7 with a 3.06 ERA that season.

26175633,"""I saw the reactions I wanted on almost every one I threw,"" Verlander said after throwing seven of them during a 4-1 win over the Miami Marlins on Thursday in Jupiter, Florida.
Justin Verlander will make his 11th career Opening Day start when the Astros face Tampa Bay and defending Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell on March 28.
Verlander is earning $28 million this year at age 36, part of a deal that includes a $22 million option for 2020 that would become guaranteed if he is among the top five in Cy Young Award voting this year.
He allowed five hits in 3 1/3 scoreless innings Thursday, striking out five and walking two.
The 2011 AL MVP has unsuccessfully attempted to add a changeup in the past. He has altered the way he's releasing the pitch, which has him optimistic it will prove useful once the season starts.
""He's always evolved,"" Houston manager A.J. Hinch said. ""I watched him over the last 10 years, so it won't surprise me if he makes it more of a part of his game, but I think he's going to have to feel it and have some success to truly believe in it.""
Verlander's fastball reached 97 mph. He threw 60 pitches and left with the bases loaded.
""I'm glad I went back out there for that last inning,"" Verlander said. ""Velo was where I'd like to see it. Got in a little bit of a jam, so got some adrenaline going.""
In other news, second baseman Jose Altuve did not play Thursday because of general left side soreness and likely will return to spring training games this weekend, Hinch said. Third baseman Alex Bregman also was out of the lineup after leaving Wednesday's game with back stiffness. He might return to the lineup Friday.

26227865,"Last May, Soto exploded onto the scene as a 19-year-old outfielder with the Washington Nationals. Due to injuries in D.C., he was rushed to the majors after just eight games above Class A. Over the next four and a half months, he wrecked big league pitching and developed a habit of doing things few, if any, teenagers before him had accomplished. But that was then, and this is now.
Following a freshman campaign that, were it not for Atlanta's Ronald Acuna Jr., would have made him the runaway Rookie of the Year, Soto isn't sneaking up on anyone. What's more, now that a certain superstar and his big bat have moved just up the road to Philly, Soto is being counted on to do even more. Suddenly, he's the face of the outfield -- and the heart of the lineup -- on a Nationals team trying to conquer a stacked NL East and prove that there is, in fact, life after Bryce Harper.
Yes, Bryce Harper was the face of the franchise. But his now-former team has plenty of star power to move on without him, and maybe even win a playoff series.
Hitters 25 and under weren't just good in 2018. They were historic.
Bryce Harper won't be wearing any of Washington's 18 potential threads this spring, but there is a 6-foot 45-pounder in the clubhouse who will. And he might be making history.
""I don't feel any pressure,"" the 20-year-old said while standing in front of his spring training locker at the Nats complex.
A year ago, Soto wasn't in big league camp. He was the No. 2 prospect in the Nats organization, and the most recent work experience on his résumé was 23 games in Class A to finish the 2017 season. But he mashed to open 2018 and, after veteran Howie Kendrick suffered an Achilles injury in mid-May, he was called up directly from Double-A. Nine months later, he was cordially invited to West Palm for his first spring training. Waiting there for him was a locker with a name plate -- and, of course, expectations.
""If you play well, people expect good things out of you,"" said Nationals shortstop Trea Turner, who hit .342 as a rookie in 2016, when he finished second in the ROY balloting. ""That's what you want. Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, all these unbelievable players are expected to be that good, each and every year. He's in that category of expecting great things from him.""
If you're scoring at home, yes, Turner just compared his young teammate -- who cracked the top 50 in ESPN's MLB Rank after just one season, finishing 35th, ahead of established stars such as George Springer and Anthony Rizzo -- to two of the game's best players. He isn't the only one who has mentioned Soto's name in proximity to the Millville Meteor.
""I played with another guy that was just like that, and his name was Mike Trout,"" said Kendrick, who spent four years playing alongside Trout on the Angels. ""I see a lot of those same similarities in Juan coming in every day, playing the game, plays it at a high level. Not quite as speedy as Mike Trout, but he does a lot of similar things that Mike does. Hopefully [he'll] continue his success into the season and show us what type of player he's really going to continue to be.""
Juan Soto's 2018 campaign compares favorably with some of the more notable performances from 19-year-olds in MLB history:
The type of player Soto wants to be is the kind who gets noticed for his leather as much as his lumber. ""Win a Gold Glove,"" he said, when asked his individual goals. It's a lofty objective for a guy who has always been known for his stick. A guy who isn't blessed with great wheels and whose minor league teammates nicknamed him ""El Gamba"" (Spanish for bowlegged). A guy who, prior to last season, had never played left field (he played exclusively right in the minors) and who accounted for minus-5 defensive runs saved as a rookie (among qualified left fielders, only Rhys Hoskins ranked lower).
Not surprisingly, defense and speed were points of emphasis this offseason for Soto, who spent most of the winter in his hometown of Santo Domingo, where he worked out with Mariners outfielder Domingo Santana and top Nats prospect Victor Robles. But that's not what people talk about when they talk about Soto's offseason. Instead, they home in on the ball he demolished in Japan. It looked like it was going to travel 500 feet but instead hit the roof of the Tokyo Dome and was called a ground-rule double.
""It's one of the hardest I've hit,"" said Soto, who grazed the roof not once but twice while playing an All-Star exhibition series in Japan in November. ""I crush[ed] it.""
There were other huge  offers out there, but the mutual commitment made the difference for Bryce Harper and the Phillies. Jeff Passan
Miller: Baseball's LeBron? How we were right -- and wrong -- about Bryce
 Law: Win-win deal | Winners, losers
That isn't the only thing Soto crushed last year. In 116 games with the Nationals, the powerful lefty hit 22 homers. He finished the season with a .923 OPS that would've ranked third in the National League -- behind two guys named Yelich and Arenado -- except he was eight plate appearances shy of qualifying. But what stuck out most to those who watched Soto on a regular basis was his plate discipline.
""What everyone strives for is to swing at good pitches and take bad ones. He can do it already,"" Turner said of Soto, whose 79 walks last season ranked 10th in the NL and were the most ever by a teenager. ""So I think he'll be fine.""
That isn't to say Soto is a finished product at the plate. He's well aware of how opposing pitchers adjusted to him over the course of the season -- more fastballs up in the zone, more breaking balls down in the dirt -- and expects that to continue.
""Pitchers [will] keep doing the same thing,"" said Soto, who hit .229 on curves and sliders, 13 points below the league average against breaking stuff. ""Try to get me in the same spot.""
Regardless of whether they get him, Soto isn't concerned. He knows that, Bryce or no Bryce, the Nationals lineup -- an attack that features Turner, Anthony Rendon and Adam Eaton, as well as new additions Brian Dozier, Kurt Suzuki and Yan Gomes -- is deep and balanced. Plus, the rotation fronted by Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and newcomer Patrick Corbin is among the best in baseball.
""We're not just one player,"" he said. ""We are a team, so we're going to keep working as a team. I don't feel any pressure. I'm Juan Soto, but I'm part of the team.""

26218842,"The 26-year-old left-hander, who's not yet eligible for salary arbitration, will earn $573,700 this year after making $558,200 in 2018, when he was a first-time All-Star and went 21-5 with an AL-leading 1.89 ERA over 31 starts.
The Rays announced the decision Sunday, adhering to a rigid club policy for compensating young players who have not spent the necessary three years in the majors to be eligible for arbitration.
Snell, who led the AL in victories after winning just 11 games combined over the previous two seasons, has accrued 2 years, 72 days years of service -- this year's cutoff was 2 years, 134 days.
The pitcher's agents, Adam Karon and Tripper Johnson of Sosnick, Cobbe & Karon, issued a statement on behalf of Snell, who allowed two or fewer runs in 27 of 31 starts and limited opponents to an .088 batting average with runners in scoring position last season.
""The Rays have the right under the collective-bargaining agreement to renew me at or near the league-minimum salary,"" Snell said.
""They also have the ability to more adequately compensate me, as other organizations have done with players who have similar achievements to mine. The Rays chose the former,"" he said. ""I will have no further comment and look forward to competing with my teammates and field staff in our quest to win the World Series in 2019.""

26135364,"Guerrero told ESPN that has been his average weight for the past two years and he hopes his participation in the Blue Jays' major league camp for the first time continues to help him improve his conditioning.
""That weight is normal for me; that's what I weighed last year. But this spring training, getting in better shape is part of my job too,"" Guerrero said in a one-on-one interview with ESPN. ""Part of the work I am focused on this spring training is to strengthen my body and be as healthy as possible. I am not killing myself to lose weight but it is my job to be in the best shape possible for when the season starts.""
Some of that has involved changing his diet to prepare for playing at the highest level.
""Right now I feel that I am in a good place,"" Guerrero said. ""Since last year, I've been working on not eating fast food and making better food choices. I think that when you get more experience you know how to control your emotions more.""
Guerrero is well aware that the Blue Jays have had past concerns about his weight. In 2014 as a 16-year-old, he was asked to drop at least 20 pounds off his 6-foot frame, which he promptly worked on before signing with the team.
He had some help back then, and he hopes to have some help now as he continues to work on optimizing his natural physical attributes.
""Back in 2014 I asked my dad for advice in dropping the weight and he spoke with my grandmother and she helped me,"" he said. ""She would prepare all my meals; she would cook the meats and sweetbreads I like in a very healthy low-fat manner. I also started eating a lot more vegetables and drinking green juices and it helped me lose those 20 pounds.""
Altagracia Alvino, Guerrero's paternal grandmother, has always been a source of inspiration for the family. She lived in Venezuela and Colombia and worked as a housekeeper to support her children for over a decade, including Vladdy's famous father, Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero Sr.
Her cooking was actually famous throughout the major leagues at one point, when she would cook enough rice and beans and other Dominican delicacies not only for Guerrero's teammates on the Montreal Expos and Los Angeles Angels, but also for opposing teams' players.
""My grandma arrived on Wednesday; she'll stay with me for the duration. I of course enjoy her cooking and she helps me but I was here alone and I needed someone from my family, and she always spends time with me during the spring, so I am happy to have someone from my family here,"" Guerrero explained.
Guerrero's spring training at-bats continue to be a social media phenomenon, with his latest one-handed double off the wall captivating MLB's Twitter on Sunday afternoon. But he remembers the lessons taught to him by his grandmother, who advises not paying attention to all the hype surrounding his debut.
""It was good and I am happy about that but that kind of stuff doesn't matter to me,"" he said. ""I think that one of the best things that ever happened to me is having grown up with my grandmother because that's how I have grown up with humility and always wanting to work hard. I did that. But it doesn't matter. I am just working hard every day and every day I'm getting better.""

26065598,"""I know as players, that's something that MLB is trying to negotiate,"" said Scherzer, a newly elected member of the Major League Baseball Players Association's executive board. ""I don't think there's negotiation here. As players, it just shouldn't be in the game. Having a pitch clock, if you have ball-strike implications, that's messing with the fabric of the game. There's no clock in baseball, and there's no clock in baseball for a reason.""
After pushing for an agreement with players last season, management decided on its own to experiment with 20-second pitch clocks during spring training this year, part of the sport's effort to speed the pace of play. Owners have the right to implement the clocks for the regular season but would prefer to reach an agreement with the union.
While the potential loss of Bryce Harper could be a big blow to Washington's lineup, an offseason defensive overhaul might be the difference-maker in a tough National League East fight.
From Paul Goldschmidt in St. Louis to Josh Donaldson in Atlanta, we tell you what to expect from some familiar faces in new places.
Even with the rise of new tactics like the opener, old-school aces are leading the way.
Under the phase-in designed to allow teams to get used to the concept without fear of penalty, pitchers and batters who were taking too long in Saturday's games were merely warned to hurry up.
When the policy, which has been used in some minor leagues since 2015, is phased in, a ball could be charged in certain situations to pitchers who do not begin their motion in time. Batters delaying the game might draw a strike.
Washington played its Grapefruit League opener Saturday night against Houston. Scherzer came close to using the full 20 seconds on a couple of occasions with runners on base, but the clock didn't expire.
The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches features a pitch clock beneath the main outfield scoreboard and two at ground level behind home plate near each dugout.
""Now having to actually throw to it, I think it's more of a distraction than anything,"" Scherzer said. ""I get that there are parts of the game that we can clean up, and I think that there can be meaningful changes. I'm fundamentally against this.""
Scherzer felt his first outing dragging a bit, attributing the slow play to a high number of foul balls. He referenced an article published a few days ago by FiveThirtyEight citing an increase in foul balls as being a major reason for longer games.
""I'm not going to put my name next to this clock,"" he said.
Scherzer allowed one run on a Jake Marisnick homer, one of three hits he gave up in two innings. He struck out three and walked one while throwing 25 of 44 pitches for strikes.
The Nationals' game was one of 16 across Florida and Arizona that were played under the new rules, for which there won't be threat of penalty for the first few days or more. There were no notable incidents in the afternoon, when three of the six games approached or surpassed three hours.
""I hope it gets the tempo up,"" Marlins manager Don Mattingly said after the St. Louis Cardinals beat Miami 11-1 in 3 hours, 15 minutes. ""It sounds like at the minor league level they get used to it, and that's the way you go.""
Elsewhere, Los Angeles Dodgers veteran Rich Hill threw seven pitches in the first inning and retired the Chicago White Sox in order.
""I didn't notice the pitch clock,"" he said. ""I'm against it, but I think it's just really a fundamental thing for me. That's it, period. It's there, great, maybe we can be aware of it. But if it's going to dictate the outcome of the game, I would hope everybody who loves the game and watches baseball would be against it for that reason only.""
Hill added, ""If it's out there and it's, 'Hey, we have to pick it up, we're using the clock to use as a warning or a guideline,' that would be fine. But I didn't really notice the clock. I usually pitch with pretty decent pace anyways.""
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who has two of the slowest pitchers in the game in Joe Kelly and Pedro Baez, said he thinks they will figure it out.
""They have to adjust,"" he said. ""That's just the way it goes. We'll have those conversations with those guys. I think with spring training, it's a good opportunity for these guys to make an adjustment.""

One key 2019 projection: His FanGraphs projection for 3.4 fWAR is highest among Pirates position players.
Did you know? Bouncing back from an 80-game suspension for PEDs in 2017, Marte delivered career bests last year in home runs (20) and slugging percentage (.460).
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: The 2019 Bill James Handbook forecasts him for 27 homers after he hit 28 and 27 the previous two years.
Did you know? Conforto has yet to settle in at one outfield position, never starting more than 71 games at any of the three spots in his three full seasons. But last year's second-half breakthrough for an .895 OPS after a slow start cemented his future as an everyday player.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: Multiple projection systems have Eovaldi starting more than 21 regular-season games for the first time since 2015.
Did you know? Coming back from his second Tommy John surgery, he changed his mix, which transformed Eovaldi from frustrating flamethrower to postseason hero. His new reliance on a cutter (thrown almost a third of the time) helped him deliver a career-best 22.2 percent strikeout rate to complement a career-high 97.2 average fastball velocity.
2018 rank: 62
One key 2019 projection: Marcels projects an improved strikeout rate, rising from 7.4 SO/9 to 8.1.
Did you know? Lester has an 11-season streak of making 30 or more starts, but it's a sign of the times -- and the Cubs' commitment to keeping their ace fresh for October -- that last year, he faced his lowest seasonal total of batters during the streak (761).
2018 rank: 42
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects a repeat of last year's 2.7 fWAR.
Did you know? Following his 2017 breakout (.924 OPS), he fell back to his career norms (.758 last season, .781 career) thanks to an injury-wracked first season in St. Louis. If that big year is how he can still be when healthy, he'll rise up the rankings again.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key projection: Projection systems expect Osuna to earn more than 30 saves in 2019 after he earned 21 total in 2018 with the Blue Jays and Astros.
Did you know? Osuna's first save in Houston came on Aug. 22. From then on, he had 12 saves to finish off the season, two more than the next-closest players (Jeremy Jeffress, Ken Giles and Felipe Vazquez each had 10).
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: 2018 was the first year in Gennett's career he got more than 600 plate appearances, and he set career highs in hits (181), OBP (.357) and WAR (4.2). He's projected for more than 600 PA in 2019.
Did you know? Gennett hit 23 home runs while playing at second base last season, second-most in MLB to Ozzie Albies (24).
2018 rank: 88
One key 2019 projection: Most projections have Puig reaching a career high (currently 28) in home runs in 2019.
Did you know? Since Puig's first season in Los Angeles, he was second on the team among hitters in WAR (18.6). Puig posted a career-best 5.1 WAR in 2014. The last Reds outfielder to post 5 WAR in a season was Jay Bruce in 2013 (5.1), and before that it was Ken Griffey Jr. in 2000 (5.5).
2018 rank: 74
One key 2019 projection: After a career-low 10 home runs (in a career-high 138 games), ZiPS has Contreras bouncing back to 14 homers in 2019.

One key 2019 projection: Freeland's 2.85 ERA in 2018 was a single-season record for a Rockies pitcher who has made at least 30 starts, but projections have his ERA regressing to north of 4.00 in 2019.
Did you know? Freeland was actually worse on the road in 2018, posting a 3.23 ERA compared with a 2.40 ERA at home, which is the best by a Rockies pitcher who has made at least 10 starts at home in franchise history.

Did you know? Abreu has three 30-homer seasons in his career, third-most by a player born in Cuba (Rafael Palmeiro has 10, Jose Canseco eight).

2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: Hicks set a career high with 581 PA last year after never getting more than 400 in any season, but THE BAT projects him for 633 PA in 2019, tied for second-most on the Yankees.
Did you know? Hicks' 27 homers in 2018 were more than he had in his first two seasons in New York combined (23). Before 2018, the Yankees hadn't had a player with 25 homers and 10 steals since Curtis Granderson in 2012 (Didi Gregorius also did it in 2018).
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: The major projection systems expect Olson to hit 30 home runs for the first time in his career.

One key 2019 projection: The major projection systems have Keuchel's ERA around 3.60, which would be the first time he has posted back-to-back seasons with a 3.00 ERA or worse since he became a full-time starter in 2014.
Did you know? Keuchel's strikeout rate plummeted to 17.5 percent in 2018, 55th out of 58 qualified pitchers and the lowest in any full season in his career. He struck out a career-best 23.7 percent of batters when he won the Cy Young in 2015.

2018 rank: 95
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS, Steamer et al. don't expect quite the production Segura had with Arizona and Seattle, with his WAR dipping below 3.0. He averaged 3.9 fWAR the past three seasons.

2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: Did Mikolas capture lightning in a bottle with his 18-4, 2.83 ERA season in 2018? The projection systems think so, with Steamer predicting a 12-11 record with a 4.04 ERA this year.
Did you know? Mikolas led the National League with 186 hits allowed but made up for that with a league-best 1.301 walks per nine innings.

One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects Merrifield to finish second in WAR among AL second basemen.

2018 rank: 52
One key 2019 projection: Restricted this season to hitting, the 2018 AL Rookie of the Year is one of three Angels projected to hit 30 or more home runs by the Bill James Handbook.
Did you know? Remember all those scouting reports that said Ohtani's bat wouldn't be that much of an asset? After Ohtani's 2018 season on the mound effectively ended on June 6 (he made just one more pitching appearance), his OPS was .935 for the remainder of the year.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: Projected for more than 30 saves by some systems, Hand would set a single-season Indians record for a left-hander (21 by Dave LaRoche in 1976).

2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: He's projected by ZiPS to finish sixth in the AL in wins with 14.
Did you know? Berrios could be coming into his own as a workhorse; last year, in his third time through the opponents' batting order -- a task many starters aren't even being allowed to attempt anymore -- he limited hitters to a .632 OPS.
2018 rank: 53
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS, Steamer, Bill James and PECOTA all project a career-worst ERA from MadBum, with none better than 3.74.
Did you know? After two freak-injury-shortened seasons, you might expect a return to full health to mean more durable dominance, but his walk and strikeout rates were both headed the wrong way the past two seasons.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects Haniger to finish fifth among AL outfielders in fWAR.
Did you know? As big as his breakout season looks at first glance, it could be even bigger if his home park weren't holding him back. Haniger's OPS on the road last season (.914) ranked sixth in the AL, between Giancarlo Stanton and Jose Ramirez.
2018 rank: 81
One key 2019 projection: PECOTA pegs Price for a 4.15 ERA, which would be his worst since his rookie season.
Did you know? Price is coming up on several career milestones, as he should eclipse 150 wins and 2,000 strikeouts this season. He would become the 26th lefty to reach 2,000 K's.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: The Bill James Handbook projects him for 34 home runs, cracking the AL's top 10.

2018 rank: 36
One key 2019 projection: PECOTA says he's going to get back to 30 home runs this season.
Did you know? The major projection systems are giving Sanchez something of a break from last year's disappointments, anticipating he'll top all AL catchers in value via WAR, fWAR and WARP.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS thinks he'll follow up last year's breakthrough by posting another 3.0-plus fWAR season.
Did you know? Last year's 4.7 WAR season is a nice reminder of the talent that got Taillon picked between Bryce Harper and Manny Machado as the second overall selection of the 2011 MLB draft; coming back from cancer and Tommy John surgery, he's only just begun proving how valuable that pick was.
2018 rank: 38
One key 2019 projection: PECOTA is one of the few projection systems that says he doesn't get the 13 wins he needs to reach 200.
Did you know? The Bill James Handbook puts Greinke's shot at reaching 300 wins at 13 percent. He has averaged more than 15 wins per season the past 10 years, a pace that would get him there in 2025.
2018 rank: 59
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects him to have the second-best fWAR on the Angels for the third year in a row.

2018 rank: 23
One key 2019 projection: While PECOTA, Bill James and Marcels project fewer than 30 homers, ZiPS forecasts 34.
Did you know? None of these systems sees Bellinger eclipsing the 39 homers he hit as a rookie in 2017, but last year's six defensive runs saved in 50 games in center field suggests he has more than one tool that might vault him back into the top 50.
2018 rank: 28
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects a ninth consecutive season of 80 or more strikeouts in relief. He's tied with Craig Kimbrel for the longest active streak.

2018 rank: 18
One key 2019 projection: His FanGraphs projection of a .376 wOBA is tied for 12th among all hitters.

26137051,"Bryce Harper has overthrown the King.
According to retailer Fanatics, Harper's new Philadelphia Phillies jersey set a company record by becoming the top online seller in any sport for any player during the first 48 hours after its launch. The previous record belonged to LeBron James and his Los Angeles Lakers jersey, a Fanatics spokesman confirmed to ESPN. The next best-selling jerseys after James' were the ones that belong to Giancarlo Stanton (New York Yankees), Khalil Mack (Chicago Bears) and Jimmy Garoppolo (San Francisco 49ers).
Harper's Phillies jersey became available to the public at 2:10 p.m. ET Saturday, about 10 minutes after the start of a news conference to formally introduce the star outfielder, who last week signed a 13-year, $330 million contract that is the richest deal in North American sports history.
The superstar seemed destined to land baseball's biggest contract ever, but his career has been anything but predictable.
After wearing No. 34 during his entire seven-year tenure with the Washington Nationals, Harper switched to No. 3 with his new team. Recent Hall of Fame inductee Roy Halladay -- who died in a plane crash in November 2017 -- wore No. 34 during his four seasons in Philadelphia. The last Phillies player to wear 34 was catcher Andrew Knapp during the 2017 season. Prior to Harper, outfielder David Lough was the most recent player to don the No. 3 in Philadelphia (2016).
According to Fanatics, the top three markets for sales of Harper jerseys so far are Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and New York.

26087908,"The agreement allows MLB to implement changes to Atlantic League playing rules in order to observe the effects of potential future rule changes and equipment in the majors.
According to Baseball America, those changes could include moving back the mound and using a computerized data system, called Trackman, to call balls and strikes, as well as to send in-depth data about every pitch and ball put into play in the Atlantic League.
Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said management is focused on pace-of-game changes for 2019, and bolder ideas suggested by players such as expanding the designated hitter to the National League are too complicated to be put in place this season.
MLB and the MLB Players Association are discussing potentially drastic rule changes, sources told ESPN. A three-batter minimum for pitchers, a universal DH and a 20-second pitch clock are among the items discussed.
If MLB wants to speed up pace of play, it should. But as an olive branch, grandfather in veterans like Max Scherzer.
Several proposed rule changes and experimental equipment will be announced in the coming weeks, according to a joint statement from MLB and the Atlantic League.
""We are excited to announce this new partnership with the Atlantic League,"" said Morgan Sword, MLB's senior vice president for league economics and operations. ""We look forward to bringing some of the best ideas about the future of the game to a highly competitive environment.""
""The Atlantic League prides itself on innovation,"" league president Rick White said. ""In that spirit, our board of directors, led by chairman and founder Frank Boulton, enthusiastically and unanimously approved this forward-looking agreement.""
In the past, MLB has used the Arizona Fall League as its testing ground. But the Atlantic League offers players with more experience. More than 40 percent of Atlantic League players have major league service time, and most have spent time in the minors.
Entering its 21st season, the Atlantic League has eight teams: High Point Rockers in High Point, North Carolina; Long Island Ducks in Central Islip, New York; New Britain Bees in New Britain, Connecticut; Somerset Patriots in Bridgewater, New Jersey; Lancaster Barnstormers in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in Waldorf, Maryland; Sugar Land Skeeters in Sugar Land, Texas; and York Revolution in York, Pennsylvania.

26105394,"Manager Gabe Kapler heard the big news from fans in the stands during the Philadelphia Phillies' spring training game. His team won the Bryce Harper sweepstakes, agreeing to a 13-year, $330 million deal with the free-agent outfielder, league sources told ESPN's Jeff Passan on Thursday.
Harper's deal includes a no-trade clause and has no opt-outs, league sources told ESPN, indicating that he is committed to the Phillies for possibly the rest of his career.
Fans showed Kapler and the Phillies their phones, giving updates as reports leaked out. He said he asked them where they were getting the info, afraid it wasn't legitimate.
There were other huge  offers out there, but the mutual commitment made the difference for Bryce Harper and the Phillies. Jeff Passan
Miller: Baseball's LeBron? How we were right -- and wrong -- about Bryce
 Law: Win-win deal | Winners, losers
""If the reports are true, it's a huge moment for our baseball team,"" Kapler said after the game. ""We get a lot better on the field, and Bryce Harper is a great teammate. We'd love to have him in our clubhouse, if the reports are true.""
The 2015 National League MVP and still only 26 years old, Harper was one of the top prizes in this year's crop of free agents. Infielder Manny Machado agreed to a 10-year, $300 million deal with the San Diego Padres, and it was assumed Harper's total would exceed that contract. Not only did he do that, his total beats Giancarlo Stanton's 13-year, $325 million extension signed with the Miami Marlins.
Harper receives a $20 million signing bonus and a $10 million salary for this season. He will be paid $26 million annually from 2020 to 2028 and $22 million per season from 2029 to 2031, Passan reports.
""We had average values of $45 million offered on shorter-term deals,"" Harper's agent, Scott Boras, told the New York Post. ""We had a full buffet.""
MLB Network was the first to report that Harper and the Phillies were closing in on an agreement.
""The goal was to get the longest contract possible,"" Boras told the Post. ""Bryce wanted one city for the rest of his career. That is what I was instructed to do. It is very difficult in this time to get length of contract that takes a player to age 37, 38, 39.""
The Phillies, Giants and Dodgers were vying for Harper. The Dodgers were interested in signing him to a short-term deal. The San Francisco Chronicle, citing multiple sources, reported the Giants went as high as 12 years and $310 million with their offer.
Kapler, who said Harper would likely hit third or fourth in the lineup, met with Harper during the offseason courtship.
""One thing we know about Bryce is that he's an intense individual,"" Kapler said. ""He plays the game especially hard.""
According to contract details obtained by The Associated Press, Harper would earn an extra $50,000 each time he is an All-Star, wins a Gold Glove or a Silver Slugger or is selected League Championship Series MVP. A World Series MVP trophy would be worth an additional $100,000.
He would get $500,000 if he is league MVP, $50,000 for finishing second in the voting and $25,000 for third. Following news of Harper's decision, his odds to win the 2019 NL MVP award moved from 6-1 to 5-1 at the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook.
In addition, Harper gets a hotel suite on road trips and the right to purchase a suite for games at Citizens Bank Park.
While there were other huge offers out there, the mutual commitment made the difference. But will Harper and Philly live happily ever after?
The contract is his. Now, starting tomorrow and for 13 years to come, it's time to get to work.
Bryce Harper can be as dynamic as baseball gets, but it hasn't always gone smoothly for him. Here's a look at his road to one of the game's biggest contracts.
Harper isn't the only upgrade to the roster for the Phillies, who were 80-82 to finish third in the NL East last season. They traded for catcher J.T. Realmuto and infielder Jean Segura and signed outfielder Andrew McCutchen and reliever David Robertson.
""It's exciting. He's a superstar player,"" said starter Aaron Nola of Harper, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""We were already a better team without him, but now that we got him, it takes it up a notch.""
Nola signed a four-year extension of his own this offseason. He was asked by NBC Sports during the Phillies' game Thursday what the Harper signing meant.
""We're not rebuilding anymore, and that's exciting,"" Nola said, adding: ""We are ready to contend again.""
Phillies pitcher Zach Eflin told NBC that the team already had sky-high expectations but adding Harper takes it to another level.
""We are all excited. I'm sure he's excited,"" Eflin said. ""It's going to be a lot of fun for many years to come.""
Eflin was asked what this says to the fans. ""Anybody can look at it and see it's time to win,"" he said.
Former Washington Nationals teammate Max Scherzer said Harper's 13-year contract is good for the game. It will also provide Scherzer with a new challenge as Harper moves within the NL East.
""Hey, we get to face him,"" Scherzer said. ""It will be fun.""
Washington manager Davey Martinez was happy for his former player.
""He deserves it,"" Martinez said. ""He's one of the best young players in the game. I'm glad I got to spend a year with him. We'll always be close. He makes that division a little bit tougher. But I wish him all the best, I really do. Good for him.""
Harper is a six-time All-Star and was the NL Rookie of the Year in 2012 who spent his first seven seasons with the Nationals. He is a patient hitter, known for hitting a lot of homers and drawing a lot of walks, and has a .279 average with 184 homers, 521 RBIs and a .388 on-base percentage over his career.
He hit .249 with 34 home runs and 100 RBIs for Washington last season. He struggled for much of the first half but won the Home Run Derby during All-Star festivities at Nationals Park and hit .300 with 11 home runs, 46 RBIs and 46 runs scored in 223 at-bats after the break. He led the NL in walks with 130 and ranked fifth in on-base percentage (.393).
Harper is going to a ballpark that fits him well. He has 14 career home runs at Citizens Bank Park, the most round-trippers at any road ballpark in his career. His .564 career slugging percentage at the park ranks first among 71 players with at least 200 plate appearances there. Rhys Hoskins, who will likely hit directly behind Harper in the batting order, ranks second on that list (.562).
According to Baseball Prospectus, Citizens Bank Park is tied with Miller Park as the most home-run friendly NL stadium for left-handed batters in the past three seasons.
One of the main topics of discussion for the Nationals -- and all of Major League Baseball -- going into the offseason was whether the team would be able to sign Harper to a long-term deal. According to reports, he turned down a 10-year, $300 million offer from the Nats.
He went into free agency after turning down the Nationals' qualifying offer for $17.9 million. Because the Nationals are over the luxury tax, they would get a supplementary pick after the fourth round in compensation for Harper.
Knowing his team missed out, Giants infielder Brandon Belt praised San Francisco's outfielders, but he did tell the Chronicle of Harper: ""It kind of sucks it wasn't us.""
Harper led the major leagues in 2015 with 42 homers and hit .330 with 99 RBIs. He slumped to a .243 average with 24 homers and 86 RBIs in 2016 then rebounded to hit .319 with 29 homers and 87 RBIs in just 111 games in 2017.
""He's shown the type of player he is, and now he's a grizzled veteran,'' Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said Nov. 7. ""He has done a lot in the game already, and he is just scratching the surface.""

""The fact that he wanted to throw me out in a spring training game is pretty ridiculous,"" Hinch said. ""He's known for overreaction a little bit.""
Hinch's postgame comments angered Hernandez.
""He said that? Write it,"" Hernandez said before adding, ""No comment. He got ejected for arguing balls and strikes. That's it.""
The argument could linger beyond spring training.
""I'm sure we'll revisit this in-season,"" Hinch said.

From top prospects and rising young stars to bounce-back candidates, which players who missed the MLB Rank cut could soon find a place on the list?
A major shake-up brings a new crew of All-Stars to the forefront, with some of the game's biggest names on the outside looking in.
Hinch said about a week ago Hernandez told him that he gets about four ball-strike calls wrong per game.
After a few of those calls didn't go Houston's way in the top of the first inning, Hinch said he calmly made a suggestion to Hernandez as the Astros prepared to bat.
""We have technology to help you get better and that these pitches are strikes,"" Hinch said he told Hernandez. ""He had kind of an arrogant attitude about it and didn't want to hear it.""
When Hernandez called the first pitch to Astros leadoff hitter George Springer a strike, Hinch said he thought Hernandez probably made the call out of spite.
From the dugout, Hinch said he yelled to Hernandez that he'd used up his allotment of missed calls, prompting the ejection.
Hinch emerged from the dugout and began a lengthy and at times heated conversation with Hernandez at home plate.
""When you argue balls and strikes you get thrown out, I get it,"" Hinch said. ""As it escalated, he said some condescending things that are inappropriate, unprofessional. I'll leave it at that and we'll move on to the next game.""
First-base umpire CB Bucknor attempted to intervene, but Hinch wouldn't leave the plate area for more than two minutes. At one point, Hernandez clapped his hands as if to say, ""Let's go, argument over.""
Hinch mockingly clapped back at him.
""I should thank CB. He was the voice of reason in all of it,"" Hinch said. ""CB was super calm about it, he just wanted the game to continue.""
As Hinch grew more agitated, he was restrained by both Springer and coach Alex Cintron. Hinch appeared to bump both Hernandez and Bucknor at least once each.
At one point during the argument, Cardinals starter Daniel Ponce de Leon elected to throw a warm-up pitch, doing so while Hinch stood in the right-handed batter's box, his back to the plate.
Hinch stopped to talk for several seconds with third-base umpire Mike Estabrook on his way down the left-field line to the Astros' clubhouse.
Hernandez came under scrutiny during the American League playoffs last year when he saw three calls at first base overturned by replay during a Red Sox-Yankees game in New York.
Hernandez, 57, joined the Major League Baseball umpiring staff in 1993.
Hinch said he considered making the 15-minute drive to Jupiter, where the other half of the Astros were playing a second split-squad game against the Cardinals.
""I didn't think about managing it, but I thought about showing up and shocking, the whole side of that,"" Hinch said.
The Astros side that Hinch had been managing won 5-0. The other squad of Astros beat St. Louis 11-2.

26069009,"Barely more than a week after Manny Machado picked the San Diego Padres, Bryce Harper is headed to the Philadelphia Phillies. What does the deal mean for baseball's new $330 million man, the team that signed him and the rest of baseball? We asked ESPN baseball writers Eddie Matz, Bradford Doolittle, Sam Miller and David Schoenfield to break it down.
Gut reaction: Do you like this deal for the Phillies?
Bradford Doolittle: Yeah, it kind of had to happen, didn't it? Thirteen years seems surreal on the face of it, but I thought $330 million for 10 years would work for the Phillies, so the extra length only serves to keep the average annual value down for tax calculation purposes. Whether it's three, four or even six upside-down seasons at the back end of the contract, it should be worth it. The Phillies are all in, as they should be after keeping their payroll down the past few years, and have the dollars and the minor league talent to fill holes over the next few years. Get ready, NL East fans: It's on.Bryce Harper to the PhilliesThere were other huge  offers out there, but the mutual commitment made the difference for Bryce Harper and the Phillies. Jeff PassanMiller: Baseball's LeBron? How we were right -- and wrong -- about Bryce Law: Win-win deal | Winners, losers

There were other huge  offers out there, but the mutual commitment made the difference for Bryce Harper and the Phillies. Jeff Passan
Miller: Baseball's LeBron? How we were right -- and wrong -- about Bryce
 Law: Win-win deal | Winners, losers
Eddie Matz: What's not to like? They got the guy they wanted (well, one of them). He fills some crystal-clear needs (corner outfielder, lefty stick). And all it cost them was some stupid money. Well, a whole lot of stupid money. But hey, if you can't spend it, then what's the point?
Sam Miller: From 2009 through 2014, the Phillies' payroll was consistently $50 million to $70 million more than the league average. Then, as the crucial part of their rebuilding process, they cut it to $40 million below league average in each of the past three years. It's not just that a team of Philadelphia's market size can easily afford a player like Harper making $25 million to $30 million a year. It's that the whole point of everything the Phillies just put their fans through was to clear payroll so they could sign Bryce Harper (or somebody like him). It's not just a deal I like; this deal was something of an imperative.
David Schoenfield: Here's a slightly different take: We're all focusing too much on the money and whether the Phillies paid too much. We don't know! The Albert Pujols contract looked great for the Angels at the time. The bigger issue: How good will Harper be? From 2016 to 2018 -- which admittedly ignores his monster 2015 season -- Harper ranked 22nd in the majors in wRC+ according to FanGraphs, behind Matt Carpenter and Tommy Pham, among others. Of course, there's always the hope that he can come close to 2015 again. Are the Phillies betting on that? Or are they simply betting on eight seasons or so of Harper being a top-15 hitter in the game? Will they be happy if that's the case? What if he is already morphing into a player with ""old player"" skills (more walks, lower average, bad defense)? The AAV is low enough that the contract probably won't haunt the Phillies, but there's also a chance they just gave the biggest contract in MLB history to a very good hitter, but not a dude who is one of the top 10 players in the game.
Who is the biggest winner of Harper joining the Phillies?
Doolittle: I'm assuming there will be a little initial pushback in Philly about this since the protracted nature of the negotiations sends the message that Harper didn't really want to play there. I'm sure there will be a love-hate relationship that develops between Harper and that fan base. But that's all good stuff! And Harper, who set his sights on Cooperstown long before he got to the majors, will have a better chance to put up huge numbers in Citizens Bank Park than he would have in either Dodger Stadium or (especially) The Orc.
Matz: Um, Bryce Harper. Generally speaking, any time you can sign your name on a piece of paper and you are thereby guaranteed to earn a third of a billion dollars (give or take), you're a winner in my book.
Miller: The Phillies. The headlines to this deal will note that it's the biggest contract in baseball history. But relative to the sport's growth in revenue, and relative to previous megadeals to pre-decline superstars, this one isn't expectations-shattering, and the cost of the far-distant seasons at the end of the deal isn't particularly daunting. In fact, it basically looks like the 10-year, $330 million deal you'd have reasonably expected for Harper -- with three ""free"" years tacked onto the length.
Schoenfield: I agree with all of the above. But you know who else is a winner in all this? Rob Manfred. For all the kvetching from fans, players and baseball Twitter all winter about the slow pace of free agency and suggestions of collusion or something close to it, in the end Harper got $330 million and Manny Machado got $300 million. Manfred's argument to let the market play itself out seems to be correct. The stars got their big deals. (And, yes, some quality free agents like Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel still remain unsigned.)
Who is the biggest loser of Harper joining the Phillies?
Doolittle: The Braves took a very measured approach to this offseason, much to the chagrin of a lot of their fans. On the very same day that reports came out about Atlanta's huge surge in revenue, this happens. I know the Braves want to see how their roster grows organically with a good collection of young players -- including some high-ceiling position players -- on the way. But if none or few of those players stick and the Braves end up looking up at a Harper-led Phillies squad the next few years, those glowing revenue reports might fade fast.Potential Phillies lineupWith Bryce Harper headed to Philadelphia, this is what the Phillies lineup could look like this season:LF Andrew McCutchen

Matz: Um, Bryce Harper. When Harper fails to run a hard 90 down the line, or when he goes through bad stretches -- and there will be bad stretches -- he won't know what hit him. It'll be the vitriol from Philly fans, who couldn't possibly be any more different than those in D.C.
Miller: These deals always have a ton of uncertainty, and that uncertainty grows each year the further out you go, but the one thing we can usually state with some clarity is that the player who signs a $330 million contract will probably be pretty good in Year 1. It just so happens that Year 1 looked like it could be one of the closest NL East races ever, with the Braves, Phillies, Mets and Nationals all projected (by some systems) to win between 85 and 89 games. So it's awful timing for the Braves, Mets and Nationals that this was the year the Phillies would get Harper, that this was the year the Phillies could most confidently bank the value of his superstardom. This deal will quite possibly flip the NL East title. Of course, those other three teams could have offered Harper 13 years and $335 million, and there's a good chance that in five years Harper's deal will still look eminently reasonable and they'll all regret that they didn't.
Schoenfield: I'll go with the Giants. What is their game plan? They have an old and expensive team and if they are intent on contending in these waning years of the Buster Posey/Madison Bumgarner/Brandon Crawford team, they needed a power bat for the league's worst outfield. They didn't get it. More so than the Dodgers or even the Phillies, they needed Harper for their lineup.
Which player do you think will provide the most value on his new deal: Machado or Harper?
No Manny Machado or Bryce Harper, but extensions for Luis Severino and Aaron Hicks? Things worked out just fine the last time the Bombers locked up their core and complemented it with shrewd trades.
Can you steer well enough to not run over Teddy Roosevelt? You could land an MLB job with the Nats. Here's what else the team was looking for in this week's tryouts.
Doolittle: It kind of depends on how quickly things come together in San Diego. You can see a scenario in which Machado has his best seasons there before the Padres' window is fully open, while Harper ends up having a splashy, J.D. Martinez-like first season in Philly. In terms of in-a-vacuum performance, these guys are very close, and I would expect them to remain that way, even though Harper's defense could be a growing issue. (If he needs to move to first, what happens with Rhys Hoskins?) Still, I'd take Harper on this question because I think he'll have more cracks at his value contributing to pennant contenders.
Matz: Machado. He's way better defensively and will stay healthier in the long run. That's why he'll win the WAR war.
Miller: I like Harper's deal more for the Phillies, and I think I like Harper more as a player in five years, but both teams should be happy.
Schoenfield: Machado's premium defensive ability and durability make him the better bet to earn the value of his contract -- but the Phillies are the better team and more likely to make some World Series appearances, so maybe that means Harper is the better value.
Which player do you think will appear in a World Series for his new team first: Machado or Harper?
Doolittle: Harper. The Padres need to piece together a big league rotation, and they may continue to be blocked by the Dodgers for the next few years. The Phillies' competition in the NL East will be rough, and the field there is more crowded at present than what the Pads have in the West. But there are just more ready-to-win veterans for Philadelphia, and if the Phillies can bob to the surface in that division, they'll be World Series-caliber. Could even happen this season.
Matz: Harper.
Miller: The Phillies' chances are considerably better this year, and beyond that, forecasts tend to flatten out. If neither player has won one in the next five years, I'll say the Yankees will trade for both and they'll make the World Series together. (No-trade clauses are merely openings for negotiations.)
Schoenfield: Harper and the Phillies. At this point, the Padres still only have one proven star: Machado. (Sorry, Eric Hosmer doesn't count). They'll need to hit on a lot of those prospects before they're close to the Dodgers or even the Rockies.

26040064,"The Athletic was first to report the deal Wednesday.
Harrison, a two-time All-Star, became a free agent when the Pittsburgh Pirates declined a $10.5 million option on his contract in November.
Harrison, 31, had spent his entire eight-year career with Pittsburgh, batting .277 with 52 home runs.
"
26153514,"With injuries already ravaging the upper echelon of his starting rotation, New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone admitted Wednesday that he might employ a version of the opener on occasion this season.
""I could see it being something we consider from time to time,"" Boone said. ""I don't see it a lot, but yeah, I could see it coming into play on certain occasions.
""When we're healthy and right, obviously I don't see it much, but there's some days where you could see it.""
In the wake of Luis Severino's shoulder injury, we weigh in on who is most likely to get the nod March 28 in the Bronx.
Yankees pitcher Luis Severino said his ""strength is the same"" after he felt a twinge in his pitching shoulder, and that he's optimistic that ""it's nothing bad.""
Luis Severino's right shoulder injury that came just before Tuesday's spring training game against the Atlanta Braves made this pitching tactic more of a realistic option. The Yankees are shutting down their ace for two weeks due to rotator cuff inflammation. They hope he'll resume a throwing program after those two weeks, but they still aren't expecting him to be healthy in time for Opening Day.
Boone said Wednesday that veteran lefty CC Sabathia likely would be unavailable the first two weeks of the season, too. Sabathia already has a five-game suspension looming, but he also ""probably"" will have a short injured list stint as he continues his recovery from offseason knee surgery and an unexpected December heart procedure, Boone said. With both pitchers out, the Yankees -- barring an unexpected free agency signing -- will be short-handed until their returns.
General manager Brian Cashman echoed Boone in expressing confidence in New York's young, less experienced pitchers (Domingo German, Jonathan Loaisiga and Luis Cessa) as being able to fill the void until Severino and Sabathia return.
""We love their ability,"" Cashman said. ""The tool sets are all there for them to be exciting, talented players.""
In terms of what a Yankees bullpen game would look like, expect to see a reliever like Chad Green begin a game, getting through the first six batters or so before handing the ball to a longer reliever or one of the aforementioned young starters. That second pitcher would go through the opposing team's batting order about one and a half times before the Yankees turned to their more traditional reliever roles.
""There's so many things for us that would go into [using an opener],"" Boone said. ""In a long stretch of games and you wanted to give a guy an extra day. [Or] you felt like it's a little softer landing for some guys to let them start from the back end of the lineup and give them a time and a half through.""
The Tampa Bay Rays made bullpenning a popular occurrence last season, with multiple other teams occasionally using it by the end of the year.
Even the Yankees, once their postseason fates had been sealed and they were trying to reset their rotation heading into October, had a bullpen game. Reliever Jonathan Holder started a Sept. 24 game against the Rays at Tropicana Field, lasting an inning before Stephen Tarpley, Sonny Gray, Green, David Robertson, Aroldis Chapman, Dellin Betances and Zack Britton pitched behind him. Gray lasted the longest, going two innings.

Harper went down to the dirt after being struck by a 96 mph fastball from Toronto rookie Trent Thornton.
Harper stayed on the ground for a few moments, was checked by a trainer and limped off and out of the game in the sixth inning.
Recently signed to a record 13-year, $330 million contract, Harper was playing his fourth exhibition for Philadelphia. The slugging outfielder is 0-for-5 in 10 plate appearances.
Harper had hoped to play three straight games starting Friday.
""I think it's a little premature to speculate on lost at-bats or anything like that,"" Kapler said. ""First and foremost, we probably have to get inside and meet with our medical team and discuss it. But again, not overly concerned right now.""

26221352,"With his ERA approaching 16, it's a moot point.
King Felix is royally agitated anyway.
Hernandez was tagged for seven runs in three-plus innings against the Cleveland Indians on Sunday, raising his spring ERA to 15.95 a day after Servais announced that Marco Gonzales would start Seattle's season opener March 20 against the Oakland Athletics in Tokyo.
Mariners third baseman Kyle Seager, who rolled over his left wrist during a spring training game Friday, is awaiting MRI results. Manager Scott Servais said Seager wouldn't do any physical activities Sunday.
Seattle's decision ends Hernandez's run of 10 consecutive Opening Day starts. That was the longest active streak in the majors and tied for the fourth longest ever -- Jack Morris set the mark at 14. Erik Bedard was the last starter before Hernandez to open a season on the mound for the Mariners.
Hernandez spoke publicly after his outing Sunday for the first time since Servais' announcement. Asked whether he was upset, Hernandez said simply, ""Yeah,"" but declined to elaborate on his emotions.
""I knew it was going to happen,"" he added.
Hernandez was also asked whether he could have persuaded Servais to give him the Opening Day nod with a better spring camp.
""No,"" he said while shaking his head contemptuously. ""No.""
It's the latest disappointment during Hernandez's yearslong slide from stardom. Once a 19-year-old phenom, the 32-year-old has been losing fastball velocity since his mid-20s and been mostly ineffective since turning 30. His ailments have been many. Among the disclosed: lower-back stiffness, right-biceps tendinitis, right-shoulder inflammation, a strained right calf -- and that covers only the past three seasons.
He had a career-worst 5.55 ERA in 29 games last season and was briefly removed from the rotation for the first time in the majors. This is his final season of a $175 million, seven-year contract.
Armed with a dastardly, dive-bombing changeup, Hernandez won 19 games in 2009 and the Cy Young Award in 2010, and made six All-Star teams. He has been the face of the franchise, and his King's Court fan section in Seattle was once among baseball's hottest tickets.
But even his ascent was tinged with frustration. The Mariners were seldom a contender, and Hernandez has never pitched in a playoff game. After Seattle traded away some key major leaguers this winter, it seems unlikely he ever will, at least for the Mariners.
Reverence for Hernandez remains apparent. In the home clubhouse at Peoria Sports Complex last week, King Felix held court near his locker, eating fried chicken and chatting jovially from an oversized, futuristic armchair, teammates seated around him on folding chairs.
Opening Day without Hernandez? It's hard to fathom.
""Certainly respect,"" Servais said Saturday of Hernandez's streak. ""It was a tremendous run, and he's done awesome things. I just think where we're at right now organizationally and where he's at, he wants to have a big year and this does give him more time to prepare for his first regular-season start.
""But that doesn't make it any easier. But again, we try to take as much of the emotion out of it as you can and do what's best for our ballclub.""
Hernandez will start one of two exhibition games against the Yomiuri Giants in Tokyo before the opener. Seattle returns to the U.S. and opens a four-game home set against the reigning World Series champion Boston Red Sox a week later. It seems likely Hernandez will start one of those games, but it's not certain.

26049725,"San Diego announced its $300 million, 10-year contract with the All-Star infielder on Thursday, more than two days after the deal was agreed to.
Machado will be introduced Friday morning at spring training in Peoria, Arizona. Manager Andy Green said he hopes to get the 26-year-old superstar on the field for an afternoon workout.
The agreement, the largest for a free agent in big league history, allows Machado to opt out after the 2023 season, a point at which he will have received $150 million and be 31 years old.
""Manny Machado is a generational talent, and we're ecstatic that he's chosen to spend his prime years in a San Diego Padres uniform,"" Padres executive chairman Ron Fowler and general partner Peter Seidler said in a joint statement. ""This momentous agreement speaks volumes to the direction of our organization, as well as our commitment to bringing a World Series championship to the Friar Faithful and the City of San Diego.""
It's OFFICIAL! The #Padres have signed Manny Machado to a 10-year contract through the 2028 season. Welcome to San Diego, Manny! https://t.co/zr5ZnD82Sy pic.twitter.com/F8jImsTziD
Machado gets a $20 million signing bonus, payable within 30 days of the deal's approval by the commissioner's office, $10 million this season and $30 million in each of the remaining seasons. Machado is a Florida resident, and the signing bonus will not be subject to income tax in California, which has a top rate of 12.3 percent.
Machado can pick six teams annually he can't be traded to without his consent. He gets a hotel suite on road trips and has the right to purchase premium tickets at Petco Park.
His deal is the second-largest in baseball history behind the $325 million, 13-year contract outfielder Giancarlo Stanton agreed to with Miami before the 2015 season.
To make room for Machado on the 40-man roster, the Padres transferred right-hander Dinelson Lamet to the 60-day injured list.
General manager A.J. Preller said Machado ""is one of the truly elite players in baseball and impacts the game on both sides of the ball. The resume that Manny has built at such a young age puts him in an exclusive club of big-league talent, and we feel fortunate to have the support of Ron, Peter and the entire ownership group to make this deal possible.""
The GM called it ""a landmark signing"" and added that the organization believes Machado ""is the right player at the right time for us. His combination of youth, experience and ability makes him a perfect fit for the Padres both now and in the future as we work to build a perennial contender at the major league level.""
Machado is expected to fill the team's gaping need at third base. He began last year with Baltimore, was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers after the All-Star break and struck out to end the World Series loss to Boston.
Machado hit .297 last year and set career bests with 37 homers and 107 RBI. A four-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove winner, he has a .282 career average with 175 homers and 513 RBI in seven big league seasons.
He caused a stir during the NL Championship Series last October when he failed to run out a grounder and later said: ""Obviously I'm not going to change, I'm not the type of player that's going to be 'Johnny Hustle' and run down the line and slide to first base.""
"
26026516,"Top free agents Bryce Harper, Manny Machado, Craig Kimbrel and Dallas Keuchel remain unsigned with spring training under way, creating tension during negotiations on management's proposals for a pitch clock and new limitations on relief pitchers. The union responded with a wider list of plans that include economic initiatives such as expanding the designated hitter to the National League and altering the amateur draft to make rebuilding less appealing.
""Markets change,"" Manfred said Sunday. ""We've had a lot of change in the game. People think about players differently. They analyze players differently. They negotiate differently.""
Aiming to speed up the pace of play in baseball, Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred says the league will begin implementing pitch clocks in spring training games.
Clark led negotiations in 2016 for a five-year labor deal. Players have increasingly been outspoken about their unhappiness during a second straight slow free-agent market, one that has seen many veterans take significant pay cuts and others remain without deals.
""Players' eyes don't deceive them, nor do fans',"" Clark said in a statement Monday. ""As players report to spring training and see respected veterans and valued teammates on the sidelines, they are rightfully frustrated by a two-year attack on free agency. Players commit to compete every pitch of every at-bat, and every inning of every game. Yet we're operating in an environment in which an increasing number of clubs appear to be making little effort to improve their rosters, compete for a championship or justify the price of a ticket.""
Average attendance has dropped for three straight seasons and last year fell below 30,000 per game for the first time since 2003.
Players rebuffed management's proposal for a pitch clock ahead of the 2017 and 2018 seasons. Management made the unilateral decision to experiment with a pitch clock during spring training. Manfred has said he is reticent to change regular-season playing rules unless players agree.
""Players have made a sincere attempt to engage with clubs on their proposals to improve pace of play and enhance the game's appeal to fans,"" Clark said. ""At the same time, we have presented wide-ranging ideas that value substance over seconds and ensure the best players are on the field every day. We believe these substantive changes are imperative now -- not in 2022 or 2025, but in 2019.""
Players have become increasingly outspoken about the slow pace of agreements and have mentioned the possibility of a work stoppage in 2022.
""Everybody sees it. It's obviously not good for baseball,"" said Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout, a two-time AL MVP who can become a free agent after the 2020 season.
""You got two of the top guys not signed yet. With teams saying they want to rebuild, why not start with one of the top guys? Manny, Bryce, look at the pitchers out there. It's pretty incredible. It's disappointing for the players. It's good they're standing up for themselves.""
The union is concerned that too many teams are rebuilding, trying to emulate the Houston Astros. Houston lost 106 to 111 games in three straight years from 2011-13, earned three straight No. 1 draft picks and won its first World Series title in 2017.
""This narrative that our teams aren't trying is just not supported by the facts,"" Manfred said. ""Our teams are trying. Every single one of them wants to win. It may look a little different to outsiders because the game has changed, the way that people think about the game, the way that people think about putting a winning team together has changed, but that doesn't mean they're not trying.""
Chicago Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts defended his team's decision not to spend money on this offseason's most illustrious free agents.
""That's a pretty easy question to answer. We don't have any more,"" he said. ""The fact is that we've been in the top five in spending, in baseball spending, for the last five or six years. We're in the top couple last year. We've put our money back on the field. Unfortunately, you just can't have a high-profile free agent every single year. And part of that is obviously is how much it costs, whatever, $25 million, $30 million it's going to cost, plus it's a 10-year commitment. ... As much as I would love to have a great, new, exciting player every single season, it just can't happen every year.""
Chicago is projected to exceed the $206 million luxury tax threshold along with the World Series champion Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees.
More players are considering long-term contracts with their current teams rather than going on the market when they can. Oakland's Khris Davis, the big league home run champion, is among them. He can be a free agent after this year's World Series.
""It's not a good thing to be a free agent right now,"" he said.

26075290,"He faces a long road back to the majors.
Lawrie finalized a minor league deal with the Milwaukee Brewers on Sunday, returning to the organization that took him in the first round of the 2008 draft. But it's going to be a while before he takes the field with any team in their system.
The Brewers are planning to go very slowly with Lawrie, who hasn't appeared in a regular-season game since July 21, 2016, with the Chicago White Sox. General manager David Stearns said the infielder is going to spend the next six weeks ""putting his body in the best position to succeed moving forward,"" and then progress to baseball activities.
""It's a long period, but we've got time,"" Stearns said. ""There's no rush here. This is a player who hasn't played in the major leagues for two years, and he recognizes that there's a significant amount of work to be done before he can get back on the field.""
The 29-year-old Lawrie underwent what Stearns called ""a very comprehensive performance evaluation"" before the contract was announced. Stearns said Lawrie is healthy, but they wanted to understand what was going on with his body from a physical perspective.
""He has had a number of lower-body injuries, and before we put him back out on the field, we want to understand why,"" Stearns said. ""And we want to do our best to give him a comprehensive plan for, `This is how we believe we can get you back on the field consistently and as a productive player.""
Lawrie has never played for Milwaukee. He was traded to Toronto in December 2010 and made his major league debut with the Blue Jays the following year.
He is a .261 career hitter with 71 homers and 253 RBI in 588 games over six seasons with Toronto, Oakland and Chicago. He had his best year in 2015 with the Athletics, batting .260 with 16 homers and 60 RBI in 149 games after he came over in the trade that moved Josh Donaldson to the Blue Jays.
""The ultimate opportunity for me. I've been away for about two years,"" Lawrie said on a conference call. ""I couldn't be more thankful to have this opportunity from the first team that drafted me.""
The excitable Lawrie wasn't exactly known for his professional temperament during his first stint in the majors, but he said he has changed over the years.
""I'm getting older and you can't teach experience. I have a lot of patience,"" he said. ""I think the plan we have in place is to make me the ultimate me. Try to bullet-proof me so once I get back on the field with baseball activity, I go out there and stay out there. That's the goal.""
Lawrie was cut by the White Sox on March 3, 2017. He said his agent was contacted by some teams while he was out of the game, but nothing ever materialized.
Lawrie spent time with his family in the meantime. He moved to Seattle last year with his wife, and they welcomed a baby boy. He has a sister who lives in Everett, Washington, about 25 minutes away.
But he never lost his itch to play.
""I didn't get released because I was a bad baseball player,"" he said. ""I got released because of other issues that nobody could put their finger on. That was fine with me because I always knew baseball would be there for me. Fortunately, for me, the right opportunity has come forward. I couldn't be more excited to be back with the first team that believed in me.""

26026923,"FORT MYERS, Fla. -- In apparent contradiction of his own commissioner, Boston Red Sox owner John Henry said Monday that, while there is not a perfect correlation between a bigger payroll and winning, ""spending more money helps.""
His Red Sox had the highest payroll in the sport in 2018 and won their fourth World Series title since Henry became principal owner of the franchise in 2002. During a media session on Sunday in West Palm Beach, commissioner Rob Manfred, addressing the cold free-agent winter that has Bryce Harper and Manny Machado still unsigned, said, ""I reject the notion that payroll is a good measure for how much a team is trying or how successful that team is going to be.""
Aiming to speed up the pace of play in baseball, Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred says the league will begin implementing pitch clocks in spring training games.
Asked about that comment and whether there is a correlation between spending and winning, Henry replied, ""I think the Baltimore payroll was double what the Tampa payroll was last year. Close to double. There is a correlation, I'm sure there is a correlation, but it's not as perfect. It's very difficult to predict things in baseball, to predict player performance. Spending more money helps.""
Many believe the luxury tax is working as a de facto salary cap, driving down spending, especially in free agency. Henry didn't completely agree with that assertion, however.
""It has an influence, but the biggest influence is trying not to lose money,"" he said. ""I was talking to an owner of a big team at the owners meeting and he had the same viewpoint. It's not the luxury tax he worries about. ... Even though people are frustrated and the players are frustrated with free agency, we're finding ways to spend money on other areas in baseball.""
The Red Sox and Nationals were the only teams to exceed the $197 million luxury tax threshold in 2018, with the Red Sox paying an $11.95 million penalty. The combined penalty between the Red Sox and Nationals was less than $15 million, the first time the combined tax was that low since 2003. The tax threshold increases to $206 million for 2019 and then $208 million and $210 million the next two seasons.
Baseball reported revenue of $9.4 billion in 2018, up from $9.1 billion in 2017, but overall spending on team payroll declined $18 million, the first decrease since 2010 and only the second drop since 2004.
During an interview last Friday on 590 The Fan in St. Louis, Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright said, ""I think unless something changes, there's gonna be a strike 100 percent. I don't think anybody's hiding that. I just worry people are going to walk out midseason.""
The current collective bargaining agreement between the owners and players expires after the 2021 season. Henry was on the negotiating committee that struck that deal and suggested if the union is unhappy, it needs to come to the table with ideas.
Asked about Wainwright's comment, Henry said, ""That's crazy. A lot has been said about the free-agent market, but it is a free-agent market. It's a free market, and a free market doesn't always do what you want it to do.
""It's important for the union to engage firsthand on what they would like to change. This has been a series of negotiations that led to the kind of market we have today.""
Henry and team chairman Tom Werner also addressed the team's potential signing of Chris Sale and Xander Bogaerts to long-term extensions. Both are eligible for free agency after the 2019 season, and both have had discussions with the team.
Henry addressed Sale, saying, ""He's a special player. We'd love to be able to sign him, and he would like to, as well, but there are the realities of the marketplace, budgets. This is his opportunity to be a free agent. We'd like to avoid it, and I think he would, as well, so something could happen.""
Asked if the slow free-agent market could potentially help the Red Sox sign both players, since they might be unsure about what might happen in free agency, Werner was more elusive.
""Obviously, we're at a point in time -- I think people are referring to the fact that Bryce Harper and Manny Machado haven't signed -- but at this point last year, we hadn't signed J.D. Martinez, so in some ways I think we can answer that question better in a month.""
The Red Sox ended up giving Martinez a five-year, $110 million contract that includes opt-out clauses after both the 2019 and 2020 seasons. He responded with a monster season, hitting .330 with 43 home runs and a league-leading 130 RBIs and finishing fourth in the MVP vote.
"
26048494,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- When it comes to filling big shoes, Matt Adams has nothing on Babe Dahlgren and Ryan Minor.
Dahlgren is the man who replaced Lou Gehrig in the New York Yankees' lineup the day that the Iron Horse's consecutive-games streak ended. Nearly 60 years later, Minor is the one who stepped in for Cal Ripken Jr. Two decades after that, Adams is the answer to this trivia question: Who moved into Bryce Harper's locker?
Last year, Adams' first in Washington, his cubby was just around the corner from Harper's in the Nationals' oval-shaped spring training clubhouse. This year, when the veteran slugger reported to camp after signing a one-year free-agent deal to remain with the Nats, he found his jersey hanging in Harper's old spot. For what it's worth, he isn't losing any sleep over the relocation.
""I respect the guy and everything, but to me it's just a locker,"" Adams said. ""If I'm getting caught up in whose locker I'm in, then my mind's not in the right spot.""
With a stagnant market turning free agents into freeze agents, the lefty's six-year, $140 million pact with the Nats sticks out like a sore thumb.
Max Scherzer took a shot at MLB's free agency, saying teams getting on the win-loss cycle creates bandwagon fans and poisons the game.
Not only could Manny Machado's $300 million pact increase the price tag for Bryce Harper, it also could lead to even heftier free-agent hauls for Mookie Betts and Mike Trout in two years.
The same goes for Adam Eaton, who's expected to take over the full-time right-field gig that belonged to Harper for the better part of the past seven years. ""I played the position last year. I played it before he was born,"" joked Eaton, who's four years older than Harper but made his big league debut in 2012, the same year that Harper won the National League Rookie of the Year.
Of the 603 games that Eaton has played in his career, almost a third of them have come in right field. That includes 113 games with the White Sox in 2016, when Eaton saved more runs in right field (22) than anyone not named Mookie Betts. It also includes 65 contests last season, when Harper was busy moonlighting in center field. As you might expect, Eaton isn't the least bit concerned with following in the former MVP's footsteps.
""The media puts a lot of emphasis on it, but we're professionals,"" Eaton said. ""We've just got to go out there and play. If George Herman Ruth was here and he left, we'd be like, 'That's cool. He was here, now he's gone.' Everyone's on the same page.""
Of course, it doesn't hurt that everyone has seemingly been talking about Harper's potential exodus from Washington since ... well, since Washington himself was in the White House. In other words, the Nationals have had more than enough time to prepare themselves for the possibility of Harper taking free-agent flight. And it shows.
""Knew it was a possibility. We knew that last year,"" said ace Max Scherzer, who knows a thing or two about high-profile free agents switching teams. In 2015, Scherzer came to Washington on a seven-year, $210 million deal, after having spent the previous five seasons in Detroit. Four years later, he's completely matter-of-fact about the prospect of life after Harper. ""Look, teams change. It's part of the thing.""
The thing that Scherzer refers to is the business of sports. And like any business -- whether it's banking, building or baseball -- the bottom line is the loudest line. That's why, when the Nationals signed hurler Patrick Corbin to a splashy six-year, $140 million contract in December, the writing was on the wall. And what the wall said was this: The odds of the Nationals -- who were above the luxury tax last season and still have to think long and hard about shelling out serious cash to give third baseman Anthony Rendon a contract extension sometime in the very near future -- retaining Bryce Harper just shrunk faster than a slice of bacon sizzling on a hot skillet.
Does that mean the Nationals won't re-sign Harper? Not necessarily. Now that Manny Machado is finally off the board and $300 million richer, is there any chance that his free-agent foil doesn't end up in a Phillies (or some other) uniform, owner of a contract that's decidedly larger than the $300 million one that Washington supposedly offered Harper at the end of last season? Sure, there's a chance. But for now, Everyone -- with a capital E -- in the Nats organization seems more than prepared to move ahead without him. More than prepared to get on with the business of baseball.
""Would I love for him to be here? Of course,"" said first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, who's spent his entire 14-year career in Washington and played alongside Harper longer than any other current member of the Nationals, and whose spring training locker is right next to Adams' cubby. ""But we all understand the business and the economics. That's just how it works. You get so used to the shuffling in and out of players. You get used to learning how to deal with it.""
Rookie of the Year hopeful Victor Robles celebrates ""scoring"" during a running drill here at #Nationals camp. #SpringTraining pic.twitter.com/YpiI6WHX5c
But what if Harper winds up with a division rival like Philly? What if, over the course of the next 10 years, the Nationals have to face their former franchise face 180 times during the regular season?
""It doesn't bother me wherever he goes,"" Zimmerman said. ""He's earned the right to do that. Will it be weird playing against him? Of course. But we've all played against people that we've been teammates with. I just hope he gets what he deserves. He's done some pretty special stuff at a young age. He should get rewarded for it.""
That last part, the part about getting rewarded and getting what he deserves, is a common theme. To a man, pretty much every single player inside the Nationals clubhouse seems to genuinely want Harper to get what's his. Because they know that if and when the time comes for them to hit free agency, they'll do everything in their power to get what's theirs. They're all together on this. After all, the players' union isn't called a union for nothing. As a result, everyone seems to be pulling for Harper to cash in, regardless of which front office is handing out that cash.
How do the best at each position rank and what tier of production do they fit in?
Positions: First basemen | Third basemen | Outfielders | Starting pitchers
That even goes for Nationals pitcher Erick Fedde, who grew up with Harper in Las Vegas and has known him since T-ball: ""It's a presence you'll miss in the clubhouse, but baseball's taught you to accept that sometimes you're going to lose friends."" Fedde admits that ever since the end of last season, anyone and everyone has been asking him where Harper is going to sign. His answer? ""I don't know. But I hope it's whatever's best for him.""
What's best for the Nationals right now -- and they're more than happy to tell you this -- is worrying about the guys who are in West Palm Beach instead of The Guy who isn't.
""We're going to talk about the players that we have here on the team,"" said GM Mike Rizzo, when asked about Harper a few days into spring training. ""We're not going to talk about the players that we don't have on the team. We've got a roster that we like, and we're poised to start the season as is because we really like the team that we have.""
Added manager Davey Martinez: ""I can't really think about the free agents. I've got 58 guys in camp. ... We're going to focus on the guys we have today and get them ready to play.""
In the meantime, it's worth noting that not all uniform numbers have been treated equally within the Nationals clubhouse. While the numbers of several prominent but now departed members of last year's team have been redistributed -- reliever Kyle Barraclough is wearing Daniel Murphy's old No. 20, and Gio Gonzalez's 47 now belongs to Howie Kendrick -- the No. 34 is currently not in circulation. Maybe that's just a coincidence. Then again, maybe it's not.
Maybe the Nationals are intentionally ""resting"" Harper's digits, the same way they rested Jayson Werth's No. 28 for a year before handing it out this season.
You know, just in case he comes back.

26235002,"Los Angeles announced agreements Monday with 22 players not yet eligible for arbitration. Ohtani has a split contract with a salary of $272,500 while in the minor leagues.
The 24-year-old two-way star went 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA in 10 starts as a pitcher and played 104 games overall as a rookie, hitting .285 with 22 homers and 61 RBIs. He had surgery Oct. 1 to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament, and the Angels think the earliest he could be ready to hit in games is in May. He isn't expected to pitch this year.
Ohtani left the Nippon Ham Fighters of Japan's Central League after the 2017 season and signed with the Angels for a bonus of $2,315,000. He will not be eligible for salary arbitration until after the 2020 season.
He will earn considerably more than Tampa Bay pitcher Blake Snell, last year's AL Cy Young Award winner. The Rays renewed his contract Sunday for a salary while in the majors of $573,700, a raise of $15,500 and a figure $18,700 above the major league minimum, which rose to $555,000.

Martin's lawyer had argued that the Mariners wanted arbitration as a way to keep the case out of the public spotlight, The Seattle Times reported. But Cahan said the new law, which went into effect last June, did not pre-empt the clauses in Martin's contract calling for arbitration.
From Paul Goldschmidt in St. Louis to Josh Donaldson in Atlanta, we tell you what to expect from some familiar faces in new places.
Martin was fired as the Mariners' high-performance director last fall after one season on the job. She has claimed she was discriminated against by members of the organization and claimed that general manager Jerry Dipoto, director of player development Andy McKay and manager Scott Servais made disparaging comments against Latino players.
The Mariners have denied Martin's claims. An independent investigation by Major League Baseball found no credible evidence to support Martin's claims of disparaging comments and discriminatory treatment by members of the Mariners front office.
Martin had signed a three-year contract with the team after being hired away from the Los Angeles Lakers in the fall of 2017.
"
26230045,"One hurdle to their employment that has perhaps been under-reported is that both players turned down a $17.9 million qualifying offer from their previous team. That means the signing team must pay a draft-pick penalty, which varies depending on that team's financial status. It's worth noting that all first-round picks are now protected unless a team has multiple first-round picks. In that case, the team loses its later pick. This is an obstacle and part of the reason Kimbrel and Keuchel remain unsigned, but it isn't an insurmountable one.
In his first exclusive interview since joining the Phillies, Bryce Harper goes deep on rejecting $300 million, recruiting Mike Trout and playing in Philly for life. Tim Keown
(As an aside: If there's one thing the MLBPA needs to fight for in the next collective bargaining agreement, it's getting rid of all free-agent compensation and draft penalties. Once you reach free agency, you should be a free agent. You've earned the right to not have any restrictions placed on your services.)
Anyway, it's possible that Kimbrel in particular could wait until after the draft in June to sign. At that point, his free-agent status would no longer be tied to any draft penalties. Since teams are likely interested in him on a shorter-term deal to begin with -- even potential Hall of Fame closers are still closers, with all their inherent risks -- he could sign a one-year, prorated deal and then head back into free agency. As a second-time free agent, he would no longer be tied to the draft-pick penalties. If he waits, there's also the chance that some contending team's closer gets injured or somebody's bullpen falters, and suddenly interest increases.
I don't think that will happen. I still believe he and Keuchel will sign soon. Here's a look at some of the likely landing spots for each player:
CRAIG KIMBREL
Washington Nationals
Current closer/top setup guys: Sean Doolittle / Trevor Rosenthal, Kyle Barraclough
Bullpen rank (via FanGraphs projections): 12th
The Nationals are currently about $4.5 million below the luxury-tax threshold, and going over for a third straight season would mean paying a 50 percent tax on every dollar above the threshold. Still, there is an obvious need for bullpen depth here behind Doolittle, as the team is counting on Rosenthal coming back after missing all of 2018 and Barraclough, who has averaged 5.5 walks per nine innings in his career, to throw enough strikes to avoid his declining trends the past three years with the Marlins.
Los Angeles Dodgers
Current closer/top setup guys: Kenley Jansen / Joe Kelly, Pedro Baez
Bullpen rank: Eighth
Jansen was one of the best closers in the game until last season, when he served up 13 home runs in 71⅔ innings, though he blew just four save chances. He has struggled in the past two World Series, with three blown saves, a loss and four home runs in nine appearances. Of course, Kimbrel also was shaky last October through the postseason, though he managed to avoid any blown saves. The Dodgers have more depth than the Nationals, with the likes of Caleb Ferguson, Dylan Floro and Scott Alexander, and signing Kimbrel would create a closer controversy that might be a big headache for Dave Roberts.
Atlanta Braves
Current closer/top setup guys: Arodys Vizcaino / A.J. Minter, Dan Winkler
Bullpen rank: 16th
The Braves ranked 17th in the majors in bullpen ERA in 2018, and FanGraphs projects only a small improvement (3.85 ERA), which would again leave them in the middle of the pack. Kimbrel and his family were recently spotted having dinner in Celebration, Florida, near where the Braves hold spring training, but maybe he just took the family to Disney World. The Braves have made just one significant move this offseason -- signing Josh Donaldson -- and adding Kimbrel would bring him back to where he started his career.
Philadelphia Phillies
Current closer/top setup guys: David Robertson / Seranthony Dominguez, Pat Neshek
Bullpen rank: Fifth
Gabe Kapler ran a hyperactive bullpen last year -- only the Angels and Cubs had more relief appearances -- and they've added Robertson, Juan Nicasio and James Pazos to a group that ranked 18th in the majors with a 4.19 ERA. With Robertson and Dominguez, I don't think there's an urgent need for late-game relief here, but adding Kimbrel would allow Kapler to push Robertson and Dominguez back into the seventh and eighth innings and shorten games for a rotation that has some questions behind Aaron Nola.

Minnesota Twins
Current closer/top setup guys: Trevor May / Taylor Rogers, Addison Reed
Bullpen rank: 13th
The Twins haven't been linked to Kimbrel the way the first four teams listed here have, but they might be the team that would benefit the most from signing him, especially since they have a chance to chase down the Indians in the AL Central if things break right. Fernando Rodney was the closer last year until he was traded, so May will have to win the job in spring training, but he's the favorite after a strong showing down the stretch last year. Reed and Trevor Hildenberger had long ball issues last year, as did free-agent signing Blake Parker while with the Angels. This group could be good or bad. Signing Kimbrel would add a little more certainty.
Los Angeles Angels
Current closer/top setup guys: Cody Allen / Justin Anderson, Cam Bedrosian
Bullpen rank: 24th
The Angels signed Cody Allen, coming off a rough season in Cleveland, and are counting on the hard-throwing Anderson and rookie Ty Buttrey, but they clearly lack a settled late-game group. Signing Kimbrel would help, but the Astros are such heavy favorites in the division that L.A.'s best bet for a postseason slot remains the wild card. Apparently that hasn't been enough to entice the Angels to spend big this winter.
Boston Red Sox
Current closer/top setup guys: Matt Barnes / Ryan Brasier, Tyler Thornburg
Bullpen rank: 22nd
Oh, yes ... the Red Sox. Dave Dombrowski and ownership have been consistent all spring, saying that there is basically no chance Kimbrel returns to the Red Sox. The team's bullpen depth has been hurt in recent days, however, as Steven Wright was suspended 80 games for a PED violation. Brasier has been slowed by an infection in his toe, and Thornburg has struggled early in spring training, allowing 10 hits, seven runs and two home runs in four innings. The Red Sox might be a little more desperate for relief help than they were at the start of camp. Can they win the division without Kimbrel? Sure. Can they lose the division with Kimbrel? Sure. But bringing him back makes them better.
DALLAS KEUCHEL
Philadelphia Phillies
Current rotation: Aaron Nola, Jake Arrieta, Nick Pivetta, Zach Eflin, Vince Velasquez
Rotation rank: 13th
This is still the team most often linked to Keuchel -- even after all its offseason maneuvering. It's easy to see why Keuchel makes sense: Pivetta, Eflin and Velasquez combined to go 27-34 with a 4.68 ERA. They also fanned 478 in 438⅔ innings, so the Phillies can envision better results from them. I do like Pivetta in particular as a breakout candidate, but Keuchel would be the No. 2 guy in this rotation and would allow Philly to bump Velasquez into a swingman/long relief role.
San Diego Padres
Current rotation: Joey Lucchesi, Eric Lauer, Robbie Erlin, Matt Strahm, somebody else
Rotation rank: 17th
Lucchesi and Lauer were rookies in 2018, Erlin started a career-high 12 games, and Strahm has eight career starts. In other words, this is a very inexperienced rotation. Chris Paddack, who hasn't pitched above Double-A, has looked so good that he's reportedly part of the battle for the Opening Day assignment (but most likely, he starts the year in the minors). Those four are all lefties, so bringing in Keuchel as a veteran mentor makes some sense, but after spending big on Manny Machado, Keuchel is probably an unlikely fit.
Atlanta Braves
Current rotation: Mike Foltynewicz, Sean Newcomb, Kevin Gausman, Julio Teheran, Touki Toussaint
Rotation rank: 18th
Atlanta mainstay Julio Teheran hasn't answered the questions he faces following a shaky season in 2018.
Major League Baseball's new partner is breaking out some drastic rule changes. Here's what the Atlantic League innovations mean and how likely they are to hit the majors.
As we prepare to unveil our top 100, we consider who was better (or worse) than last year's ranking and predict what we'll see in this year's voting.
Foltynewicz, coming off a season with a 2.85 ERA and 202 strikeouts in 183 innings, was to be the team's Opening Day starter, but the Braves announced Monday that he'll miss that assignment due to the sore elbow that has kept him off a mound since Feb. 24. Remember, the Braves are already down Anibal Sanchez, who signed with the Nationals after posting a 2.83 ERA in 24 starts. Yes, they have plenty of young arms waiting in the wings, including Kyle Wright, Max Fried and Mike Soroka, but Keuchel gives them certainty if they have to hedge against Foltynewicz's health.
Minnesota Twins
Current rotation: Jose Berrios, Kyle Gibson, Jake Odorizzi, Michael Pineda, Martin Perez
Rotation rank: 15th
The comment here is similar to the Kimbrel one for Minnesota: The Twins might have the most to gain, considering the gap between their fifth starter and Keuchel and the improved odds of making the playoffs that Keuchel would bring. That rotation ranking feels pretty generous, as there is obvious volatility in what to expect from Pineda (coming off Tommy John surgery) and Perez -- and even Gibson and Odorizzi (his ERA has risen three seasons in a row). They do have youngsters Fernando Romero and Stephen Gonsalves, but Romero might end up in the bullpen, and Gonsalves is more of a 4-A arm unless he learns to throw more strikes.
New York Mets
Current rotation: Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Zack Wheeler, Steven Matz, Jason Vargas
Rotation rank: Sixth
Vargas was terrible in 2018, and the others have had various issues with staying healthy. There is basically no depth behind those five. The Mets are well under the luxury tax, and their long-term commitments beyond Robinson Cano are minimal. Just because they're paying Vargas $8 million this year (plus a $2 million buyout) is no reason not to sign Keuchel.
Texas Rangers
Current rotation: Mike Minor, Lance Lynn, Drew Smyly, Shelby Miller, Edinson Volquez
Rotation rank: 26th
This is an all-reclamation rotation, as the Rangers hope to get something out of Smyly, Miller and Volquez. Good luck. The Rangers aren't going to contend for the playoffs this season, but they move into a new park for 2020 and presumably will be looking to be more competitive then. They have money to spend, and it's not like this is an organization that has been churning out starting pitchers the past several years.
Seattle Mariners
Current rotation: Marco Gonzales, Yusei Kikuchi, Mike Leake, Wade LeBlanc, Felix Hernandez
Rotation rank: 20th
The Mariners aren't billing themselves as contenders, but neither are they in a complete rebuild. They have Justus Sheffield waiting to take over a slot and Justin Dunn after him, but King Felix has looked horrible in spring training, and LeBlanc will likely regress from his 3.72 ERA/4.28 FIP from a season ago. Keuchel would project as the team's best starter, and Hernandez's big salary comes off the books after this season.
New York Yankees
Current rotation: Masahiro Tanaka, Luis Severino, James Paxton, J.A. Happ, CC Sabathia
Rotation rank: Second
The Yankees keep insisting that they're simply being cautious with Severino's shoulder, so at this point it doesn't appear to be a long-term concern. Even if Severino misses a couple of starts, there is capable back-of-the-rotation depth with the likes of Luis Cessa (who has looked good so far in camp), Domingo German and Jonathan Loaisiga. You also wonder if the Yankees have their sights set on a bigger Astros free-agent pitcher next offseason: Gerrit Cole or Justin Verlander.

26028154,"Thinking for Harper: Phillies, Nationals, Giants, Padres, mystery team
Machado: Phillies, White Sox, Padres, Yankees, mystery team
With spring training underway, it's a matter of time before Bryce Harper and Manny Machado sign free-agent deals ... we think.  ESPN baseball writers Bradford Doolittle, Eddie Matz and Sam Miller predict with whom and when the sluggers will sign.
Doolittle: Harper -- Padres, Thursday; Machado -- White Sox, Friday
Matz: Harper -- Phillies, Friday; Machado -- White Sox, Saturday
Miller: Harper -- Phillies, Tuesday; Machado -- Padres, March 14
Philadelphia Phillies 
Why it will happen: Philadelphia is the one team not shy about admitting it can dangle big mountains of cash in front of Harper. The Phillies' current projected payroll, according to Cot's Contracts data, sits at $162.5 million, well below the $206 million tax threshold. But they also have few long-term commitments beyond 2020, with just Aaron Nola, Jean Segura, Scott Kingery and Andrew McCutchen signed for more than two seasons. From a baseball standpoint, the Phillies were also just 11th in the National League in runs scored, and their right-handed-heavy lineup could use a lefty masher.
What could stop it: Harper might just not want to play in Philadelphia.
San Francisco Giants
Why it will happen: The Giants not only are desperate for an outfielder -- their current group of fourth and fifth outfielders on the 40-man roster projects for a combined 1.6 WAR, worst in the majors -- but they need a new anchor to build around as the Buster Posey/Brandon Crawford/Brandon Belt core continues to age. According to weighted runs created, which adjusts for park effects, the Giants had the worst offense in the majors in 2018. The Giants haven't had a 20-homer guy since Crawford in 2015 and haven't had a 30-homer player since Barry Bonds in 2004.
What could stop it: Oracle Park, the stadium formerly known as AT&T Park. It's maybe the toughest home run park for a left-handed hitter in the majors. Does Harper really want to go there and watch his fly balls melt on the warning track? Consider that Belt has 42 home runs at home in his career and 70 on the road, and Crawford has 32 at home and 55 on the road. No, they aren't the power hitters Harper is, but Harper is going to have trouble putting up big numbers there.
San Diego Padres
Why it will happen: They're young, they're building for the future, it's an easy hop to Harper's hometown of Las Vegas, the weather is great and the media coverage will be less intrusive than if he joins a big-market team. Plus, maybe he likes brown.
What could stop it: Maybe he doesn't like brown. The Padres might have a bright future, but they're still in a division with the Dodgers and haven't made the playoffs since 2006. Are they really going to outbid the Phillies? If this group of prospects doesn't pan out, Harper could disappear into no man's land, playing late games on the West Coast that nobody outside of San Diego will be watching.
Washington Nationals 
Why it will happen: The comfort level of staying in Washington has to be a factor, especially if the money is close to other offers -- assuming, of course, that the money is still on the table. The Nationals have spent big this offseason on Patrick Corbin and others and also will try to extend Anthony Rendon -- who, you know, might actually be the better player, if less famous. It seems possible that if the choice is between the Phillies and Nationals, why wouldn't Harper want to remain in D.C.?
What could stop it: The Nationals' public suggestion that they made a 10-year, $300 million offer was really just a smokescreen and they never had any intention of bringing him back. Plus, they might have one of the best outfields in the game without Harper in Juan Soto, Victor Robles, Adam Eaton and Michael Taylor.

You can't blame the Padres for being interested in a superstar in his prime. But the timing just isn't right, the moment isn't right, and the deal would seem destined to fall flat.
There's one thing Philadelphia wants from stars, and if either of baseball's top free agents sign there, they'd better deliver.
Three and a half months after the pursuit started, here's where things stand with Bryce Harper, Manny Machado and their suitors. Plus, updates on Craig Kimbrel, Nolan Arenado and other stars seeking paydays.

Mystery team 
Why it will happen: Philly makes the highest offer, but Harper doesn't really want to go there. The Giants decide they need to rebuild. The Padres were hoping to get him only if the price was low enough. The Nationals ... meh, they decided to give long-term money to Rendon. That leaves the mystery team, maybe on a shorter-term, higher annual average. It could be anybody. It could be ... the Yankees. Because Harper is still a perfect fit for Yankee Stadium, and they could easily rotate him, Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton between the two corner spots and DH without any issues.
What could stop it: Harper really, really likes brown. And only one team is switching to brown uniforms in 2020.
Philadelphia Phillies
Why it will happen: See above. The Phillies want a superstar. They've locked up ace Aaron Nola. They have rotation depth. They have a new shortstop in Jean Segura and a good power hitter in Rhys Hoskins. But they haven't finished above .500 since 2011. This regime under Matt Klentak and Gabe Kapler needs a winning season. Machado will help get them there.
What will stop it: Not Maikel Franco. Most likely because Machado doesn't want to play in Philly, either. Maybe he takes a short-term deal from the Yankees, sacrificing a larger, long-term payout for a chance to play in New York.
Chicago White Sox
Why it will happen: The White Sox are itching to be relevant again after six consecutive losing seasons. It's clear they're interested in Machado, and Ken Rosenthal just tweeted they remain a ""strong factor"" for Machado's services. They need a third baseman. I mean, of course they do. Have they had a good one since Robin Ventura? To be fair, they need a lot. They lost 100 games last year. Maybe without any other offers he's really enamored with, Machado elects to return to the American League and join brother-in-law Yonder Alonso and buddy Jon Jay on the White Sox, where he becomes the marquee player on a team in a big market.
What will stop it: Did we mention the Sox lost 100 games? They have some kids coming, but there's no guarantee this club is going to turn things around in the near future. Plus, the rumored offers from the White Sox seem to be well short of what Machado can get somewhere else.

As winter bleeds into spring, here's how the free-agent landscape looks right now.

• Passan: The Bryce, Manny stalemate and the latest on MLB free agency »
• Miller: Welcome to a small-market team's worst nightmare »
• Olney: The next Aaron Nola? These stars could look to cash in now  (ESPN+) »
• Gonzalez: How Dodgers' clubhouse embodies baseball's free-agency concerns »

San Diego Padres
Why it will happen: One report had the Padres offering Machado more than $240 million, maybe as much as $280 million. That would seem to easily trump what the White Sox were reportedly offering. If it's between the Padres and the White Sox, the Padres can also sell Machado on having a better farm system. Maybe the Padres even dangle playing shortstop (with top prospect Fernando Tatis Jr. moving to third base when he's ready for the majors). Or imagine this: The Padres sign Harper and Machado on the same day and they become best bros and lead the Padres to five straight NL West titles.
What will stop it: Machado is from Miami and might prefer a home closer to the East Coast. The home parks for the Phillies and White Sox are terrific home run parks, while Petco isn't, and don't underestimate that selling point to a home run hitter. Sign both Harper and Machado? And switch to brown uniforms? Don't tease us, Schoenfield.
New York Yankees
Why it will happen: It's the Yankees. They find a $(*#!@! way to make these things happen. Plus, Machado wants to play there.
What will stop it: The Yankees actually are happy with Miguel Andujar at third base. Plus, they're really saving their money for next offseason, when Nolan Arenado, Paul Goldschmidt, Xander Bogaerts, Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander, Chris Sale and J.D. Martinez are all potential free agents.
Mystery team 
Why it will happen: Because some team will suddenly realize, ""Hey, you know, maybe we could use a 26-year-old guy who can play shortstop or third base and has averaged 36 home runs, 5.8 WAR and 159 games played the past four seasons.""
What will stop it: Baseball owners gonna do baseball owner stuff.

26212179,"Who will be the best players in major league baseball for the 2019 season?
Leading off our countdown of the game's best, youngsters duel with historic greats. Which players landed on the back half of our list?
To determine this, ESPN formed a panel of almost 50 MLB writers, analysts, contributors and Insiders to determine the top 100 and rank them, voting on more than 200 players. We unveiled Nos. 100-51 on Tuesday, and now it's time for us to reveal this year's top 50.
Using some of the leading forecast models publicly available, we've identified one key stat from each player's forecast, as well as some additional info to consider about each player going into the season.
Surprises, reaction to top 100 | How did we do last year? | More MLB Rank
2018 rank: 61
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects Benintendi to have a career-high in RBIs with 91.
Did you know? Alex Cora has said he's going to hit Benintendi in the leadoff spot this season. Last year, the outfielder hit .322 in 21 games atop the Red Sox order.
2018 rank: 20
One key 2019 projection: FanGraphs projects Seager to tie his career-best RBI total (77) in just 129 games.
Did you know? Seager played only 26 games last season and is coming off elbow and hip operations. If he recovers sooner than expected, his projections could soar.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: Story is one of only two NL players predicted by ZiPS to hit 30-plus home runs and steal 20-plus bases.
Did you know? Over the past three seasons, no NL player has struck out as many times as Story (489). That said, his ZiPS-projected OBP of .326 should help keep his stolen base count high.
2018 rank: 55
One key 2019 projection: Chapman is projected by ZiPS to be the AL leader in K/9 rate at 14.84.
Did you know? A Yankees bullpen that also includes Dellin Betances, Zack Britton and Adam Ottavino could eat into Chapman's saves. But it also could allow him some extra rest and keep him healthy all season long.
2018 rank: 19
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS sees Strasburg with a 4.5 K/BB rate, which would be his best since 2015.
Did you know? Strasburg made two trips to the disabled list in 2018, resulting in his lowest start total (22) since 2011. But over eight starts to close out the season, he didn't lose a game.
2018 rank: 90
One key 2019 projection: Incredible growth is expected from Hoskins in his second full season in the majors. ZiPS says he'll drive in 113 runs.
Did you know? Hoskins came close to 100 RBIs last season primarily batting second on a Phillies team ranked in the bottom third of the league in runs scored. Now he should move to cleanup -- behind Bryce Harper.
2018 rank: 39
One key 2019 projection: According to ZiPS, Carrasco will finish the year No. 6 in the AL in strikeouts with 198.
Did you know? Since becoming a full-time starting pitcher in 2015, he is one of only five pitchers with at least seven complete games and 800-plus strikeouts.
 2018 rank: 73
ESPN Insider Buster Olney discusses the MLB Rank top 100 and more with old friend Jayson Stark on the BBTN podcast. Listen
One key 2019 projection: Paxton's projected 9.90 K/9 rate ranks behind only Luis Severino in the Yankees' rotation -- and Severino might not be ready for Opening Day.
Did you know? Paxton's swinging-strike rate has increased every year since 2015, up to 14.3 percent last season. If hitters can't catch up to his fastball, the change in stadium might not impact him as much as some fear.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: An increase in dominance, in the form of a 10.38 K/9 rate from ZiPS, points to an almost-certain solid sophomore effort.
Did you know? His 1.58 ERA and .154 opponents' batting average over the final two months of his rookie season certainly should quell fears that hitters are certain to adjust to him once there's more of a book. If anything, the 2019 projections are too cautious.
2018 rank: 2
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS predicts Kershaw will post a 2.91 ERA, which would match his career worst from all the way back in 2010.
Did you know? It's all about health with the Dodgers' ace. He's dealing with shoulder soreness this spring and has not managed even 28 starts in a season since 2015.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: Though Carpenter blasted a career-best 36 home runs last year, none of the main projection systems sees him hitting 30 again.
Did you know? A key to Carpenter's success could be his continuing to get and crush fastballs. He saw the second-most heaters in MLB last season, slugging .627 against them, while his OPS against breaking stuff was .649 with an NL-worst 48.3 strikeout rate.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: After last year's 221 whiffs, the Bill James Handbook pegs Bauer to surpass 200 strikeouts for the second time.
Did you know? The two key reasons Bauer finished second in the AL in ERA were his career-best 22 percent rate of swinging strikes and his career-low 4.3 percent home run rate on fly balls. If he keeps fooling hitters and creating weak contact, he'll climb higher.
2018 rank: 21
One key 2019 projection: His streak of four straight 30-homer seasons was snapped last year, but Steamer says he'll get back there with 30.
Did you know? Using either flavor of WAR, Rizzo's total value has dropped four straight seasons, not good news heading into the last guaranteed season of his seven-year contract with club options for 2020 and 2021 on the line.
2018 rank: 24
One key 2019 projection: The Bill James Handbook projects Springer's power stroke to return: 29 homers after last year's decline to 22.
Did you know? Springer hit 63 homers combined in 2016 and 2017, so it wouldn't be crazy to see him re-enter the ranks of the top two dozen players if he can avoid the injuries that slowed him last season (thumb and shoulder).
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: Steamer and ZiPS both project Diaz to have the best ERA among MLB relievers.
Did you know? Just three pitchers have had two 50-save seasons in a career -- Mariano Rivera (both with the Yankees), Eric Gagne (both with the Dodgers) and Jim Johnson (both with the Orioles). If Diaz adds another as a Met, he'll become the first player ever to reach 50 with two different teams.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects Soto to tie for the NL lead in home runs with 36, as a 20-year-old.
Did you know? To put that into context, Bryce Harper didn't lead the league in home runs until his fourth season, as a 22-year-old. Can Soto get there two years earlier than the Nats' former right fielder?
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: Steamer projects Chapman and Jose Ramirez to hit the most homers among AL third basemen (28 each).
Did you know? Chapman's defensive WAR value of 3.5 last season ranked ninth all time, according to Baseball-Reference.com, and only two active third basemen have topped that: Manny Machado (4.4) and Nolan Arenado (3.6), both in 2013.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects Hader to lead the major leagues in K/9 with 15.34, almost no drop-off from last year's 15.8
Did you know? Our top-ranked reliever will likely have to share save opportunities with teammates Corey Knebel and Jeremy Jeffress, but last year's rate of whiffs was an MLB record for anyone with 80 or more innings pitched, and nobody else has ever topped 15 K/9.
2018 rank: 37
One key 2019 projection: The Bill James Handbook projects Rendon to smack 43 doubles for his third straight season of 40-plus.
Did you know? Rendon ranks third in WAR among third basemen in Nats/Expos franchise history, behind teammate Ryan Zimmerman and Tim Wallach, but he has yet to be an All-Star.
2018 rank: 13
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects Stanton to lead MLB with 47 home runs.
Did you know? With the 59 homers he hit as a Marlin in 2017 on his résumé, it's worth noting that since 1969, just two Yankees have hit more than 50 homers in a season: Alex Rodriguez in 2007 and teammate Aaron Judge in 2017.
2018 rank: 82
One key 2019 projection: PECOTA projects Cole to lead all American League pitchers with 224 strikeouts and 18 quality starts.
Did you know? In his first season for the Astros in 2018, Cole posted a professional career-best 34.5 percent strikeout rate and averaged 96.5 mph on his fastball, third best among starters.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: He is one of only five players, along with Ronald Acuna Jr., Francisco Lindor, Trevor Story and Mike Trout, whom ZiPS projects to have at least 30 home runs and 15 stolen bases in 2019.
Did you know? What changed most for Baez during his breakthrough 2018 was his performance against right-handed pitchers (.286/.317/.549) and his aggressiveness early in the count (top-ranked 49 percent swing rate at the first pitch).
2018 rank: 79
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects Realmuto to set personal bests with 25 home runs, 84 RBIs and a .503 slugging percentage, with the latter also pacing his position.
Did you know? Realmuto was a .309/.356/.492 hitter on the road during his Miami Marlins career and hit 37 of his 48 home runs away from Miami.
2018 rank: 10
One key 2019 projection: His Marcel projection has him with an .817 OPS, which is just 16 points shy of his four-year career number to date (.833).
Did you know? Correa has totaled 18.3 WAR through his age-24 season, 10th-most through that age by any active player and 11th-most through that age among shortstops in baseball history.
2018 rank: 9
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS expects Votto to pace the National League with a .421 on-base percentage, just 12 points off projected major league leader Mike Trout's number (.433).
Did you know? Per Statcast, Votto hit only 30 popups the past five seasons combined. Ninety players hit more than 30 popups last season alone.
2018 rank: 34
One key 2019 projection: ESPN Fantasy projects Syndergaard to match his pro career high of 30 starts and set a new best with 185 innings pitched.
Did you know? Since Syndergaard's major league debut on May 12, 2015, he ranks sixth in ERA (2.93) and 14th in strikeout rate (27.1 percent) among pitchers who have worked at least 350 innings.
2018 rank: 100
One key 2019 projection: His PECOTA projection of a 27.8 percent strikeout rate would set a new professional career best.
Did you know? Nola was the only ERA qualifier (minimum 162 innings pitched) in baseball to manage at least 25 percent strikeout and 50 percent ground ball rates with no greater than a 7.5 percent walk rate in 2018.
2018 rank: 31
One key 2019 projection: Both PECOTA and ZiPS project Severino's K/9 ratio to drop below 10 (9.92 each), a threshold he reached in each of his full big league seasons, in 2017 (10.71) and 2018 (10.35).
Did you know? Severino's 2.31/5.57 ERA split between the first and second half last season represented a major-league-worst (among qualifiers) decline of minus-3.26 runs.
2018 rank: 29
One key 2019 projection: Steamer projects Verlander to strike out 249 hitters, which would be the 12th-most by a pitcher age 36 or older in baseball history.
Did you know? Verlander's 34.8 percent strikeout and 4.4 percent walk rates in 2018 were by far the best among his 14 professional seasons, but his 30.7 percent ground ball rate was also easily his lowest as a pro.
2018 rank: 12
One key 2019 projection: ESPN Fantasy projects Bryant to have a .382 on-base percentage and a .506 slugging percentage, only six and 21 points off his combined marks from 2015 to '17.
Did you know? Through the first two months of last season, before his shoulder issues began to surface, Bryant was a .286/.401/.524 hitter in 48 games.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS forecasts Acuna to hit an Atlanta-best 30 homers in his second big league season.
Did you know? Acuna's .917 OPS was the 11th-highest ever for a player 20 or younger, but one of the players ahead of him on the list was another 2018 rookie, Washington's Juan Soto.
2018 rank: 15
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects Machado to lead all NL third basemen with 5.4 fWAR.
Did you know? Machado has hit at least 33 homers in each of the past four seasons. The Padres haven't had a third baseman hit that many since Phil Nevin hit 41 in 2001.
2018 rank: 25
One key 2019 projection: Freeman's gap power shows up in ZiPS' NL-leading forecast of 39 doubles.
Did you know? Freeman, 29, already ranks second among Braves first basemen in career fWAR (30.8).
2018 rank: 27
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects Martinez to lead the potent Red Sox lineup in homers (36) and RBIs (106).
Did you know? Martinez's 43 homers in his first season with Boston were the most by a Red Sox right-handed hitter since Manny Ramirez's 45 in 2005.
2018 rank: 6
One key 2019 projection: Part of Kluber's greatness is just showing up; Steamer projects him to lead the majors in innings (209).
Did you know? Kluber's 33.6 WAR ranks eighth among pitchers on Cleveland's all-time list, and if he tops 5.0 WAR for a fourth straight season, he'll move up to sixth.
2018 rank: 5
One key 2019 projection: In Harper's first Phillies season, ZiPS projects him to lead the team in homers (36), runs (104), walks (119), on-base percentage (.407) and slugging percentage (.537).
Did you know? PECOTA tabs Hall of Famer Mel Ott as the most comparable player to Harper. Ott feasted on his home venue, the Polo Grounds, just as the Phillies hope Harper will get fat on Citizens Bank Park.
2018 rank: 30
One key 2019 projection: According to Steamer, Ramirez is one of five players forecast to steal at least 20 bases and hit at least 20 homers.
Did you know? Last season, Ramirez and Francisco Lindor became the first Indians duo to both surpass 7.5 WAR in the same season since Ray Chapman and Tris Speaker in 1917.
2018 rank: 11
One key 2019 projection: Steamer projects that Goldschmidt's .874 OPS will be the best on the Cardinals, but it would be his worst showing since 2012.
Did you know? Goldschmidt's 120 stolen bases since 2012 are more than double the total of any other first baseman.
2018 rank: Not ranked.
One key 2019 projection: Among pitchers Steamer forecasts to qualify for the ERA title, Snell's 3.24 projection is the fifth-best in baseball.
Did you know? Hitters managed a meek .126 average with 93 strikeouts and only one home run against Snell's curveball in 2018.
2018 rank: 16
One key 2019 projection: All the leading projection systems are forecasting Judge to take a strikeout-driven plunge in batting average, from his career-best .273 mark to a range between .251 and .260.
Did you know? What happens when Judge does make contact? Over the past two seasons, his .362 average on balls in play ranks third in the majors.
2018 rank: 3
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS forecasts a .308 batting average for Altuve, best among AL hitters.
Did you know? Altuve has actually beaten that figure the past five seasons, a stretch that includes three batting titles. He hit .332 in the first half but, bothered by a sore knee, hit just .276 in the second half and finished at .316.
2018 rank: 8
One key 2019 projection: His projected FanGraphs ERA of 2.70 is lowest among starting pitchers.
Did you know? Sale's 158 innings in 2018 were his fewest as a starter, but his .181 batting average against and 38.4 percent strikeout rate were career highs.
2018 rank: 14
One key 2019 projection: Lindor leads all shortstops with a projected WAR of 6.9.
Did you know? Lindor cracked 38 home runs in 2018, one more than Trevor Story and Manny Machado to lead all shortstops. Only four shortstops have ever hit more in a season: Alex Rodriguez, Ernie Banks, Rico Petrocelli and Vern Stephens.
2018 rank: 41
One key 2019 projection: Yelich is one of just four players FanGraphs projects to both score and drive in 100 runs (he scored 118 and drove in 110 in 2018).
Did you know? Yelich led the NL in batting average, slugging percentage and OPS en route to winning the MVP award. He became the first Brewers player to win a batting crown.
2018 rank: 57
One key 2019 projection: His FanGraphs projection of 5.5 WAR is highest on a loaded Astros team.
Did you know? In his breakout season, Bregman finished fifth in the MVP voting. His 83 extra-base hits ranked third in the majors.
2018 rank: 7
One key 2019 projection: His FanGraphs projection of 36 home runs tops all National Leaguers. He has led the league in three of the past four seasons (including his 38 in 2018).
Did you know? If Arenado does lead the league again for the fourth time, he would be the first National Leaguer to do so since Mike Schmidt did it eight times (the last in 1986).
2018 rank: 32
One key 2019 projection: His FanGraphs projected strikeout total of 248 is second-highest in the majors, 21 fewer than the 269 he fanned last season.
Did you know? Four Mets pitchers have led the NL in K's -- R.A. Dickey, David Cone (twice), Dwight Gooden (twice) and Tom Seaver (five times). Seaver's 289 in 1971 is the club record.
2018 rank: 4
One key 2019 projection: ZiPS projects Scherzer to throw 193⅓ innings, the third-highest total in the majors.
Did you know? Only six pitchers have topped 200 innings the past two seasons, but Scherzer has done it six seasons in a row, the only player to do that. He's dominant and durable.
2018 rank: 17
One key 2019 projection: Steamer and ZiPS both project Betts to score 114 runs, most in the majors.
Did you know? Last season, Betts tied for the major league lead with 129 runs -- while playing just 136 games. That was the best runs-to-games ratio since Jeff Bagwell scored 152 runs in 159 games in 2000.
2018 rank: 1
One key 2019 projection: No surprise, but Trout easily owns the highest WAR projection. His 8.6 ZiPS forecast is 1.6 WAR higher than Betts'.
Did you know? Trout has actually beat that 8.6 figure in five of his seven seasons, averaging 9.1 per year, according to Baseball-Reference. The exceptions were 2014 (7.6), when he still won MVP honors, and 2017 (6.7), when he was injured and played 114 games.

26195342,"Loaiza pleaded guilty in August to possessing about 20 kilograms, or 44 pounds, of cocaine with intent to distribute. He was arrested in February 2018.
Prosecutors had sought a sentence of nearly five years, while Loaiza's attorney had pushed for 18 to 24 months before U.S. District Judge Janis Sammartino issued her sentence in San Diego federal court.
Loaiza will be deported after serving his sentence, his lawyer said.
Speaking in court, Loaiza apologized ""to my family, friends, my fans"" and the sport of baseball. Sammartino said Loaiza had ""accepted responsibility, which is the right thing to do.""
Loaiza, 47, was under surveillance when he was arrested over a year ago near a house in Imperial Beach, which borders Tijuana, Mexico. His SUV had just left the garage when authorities confronted him.
After a canine sniffed drugs in the SUV, authorities obtained a search warrant for the house and found the cocaine in 20 packages in the compartment of another vehicle parked in the garage. Loaiza admitted in a plea agreement that he transferred the drugs from one vehicle to the other.
Loaiza was born in Mexico but attended high school in Imperial Beach. He played for several major league teams between 1995 and 2008, including the Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago White Sox.
He had a 21-9 record with the White Sox in 2003, finishing second in Cy Young voting and starting in the All-Star Game that year.

26034573,"After several incidents of alleged stealing of catchers' signs last season, including during the postseason, commissioner Rob Manfred had promised to have new directives in place this year to curtail the practice.
The Astros, after being investigated for alleged sign-stealing during the ALCS, were cleared of any violations by MLB, which considered ""the matter closed"" on Wednesday.
MLB and the MLB Players Association are discussing potentially drastic rule changes, sources told ESPN. A three-batter minimum for pitchers, a universal DH and a 20-second pitch clock are among the items discussed.
MLB already had a rule in place that prohibited sign stealing from any place other than a runner on second base. That rule would now be updated to include measures that address the use of new technology to gain an advantage on opponents.
Among the new rules, according to the SI.com report, would be:
A ban on in-house outfield cameras from foul pole to foul pole.
Live broadcasts limited to each team's designated replay official, who in turn will be monitored by a security expert.
Having all other TV monitors, such as those in the clubhouse and bullpens, on an eight-second delay.
Penalties for violation of the rules would include the forfeiting of draft picks and/or international spending money, according to the report.

26257113,"The slugger is hitless in three at-bats and has walked three times overall.
""I feel like I have six at-bats,"" Harper said. ""Still got to get going and get my timing right. That's the biggest thing. I think I'm seeing it pretty well. Just got to get timing.""
Harper received a mixture of applause and boos from the packed crowd at Steinbrenner Field when he was announced before a first-inning at-bat that ended with a grounder to first base.
The superstar seemed destined to land baseball's biggest contract ever, but his career has been anything but predictable.
The Rookie of the Year runner-up put up historic numbers as a teenager. Now 20, he's the new heart of the Nats' lineup -- and drawing comparisons not just to his former teammate but also to Mike Trout.
The outfield prospect has fallen a notch or two in the minds of some experts. But the Yankees are still seeing signs of his potential this spring.
""He's obviously not only a star player in the game but also a big attraction,"" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.
Harper, who homered for his only hit in five regular-season at-bats against Tanaka, struck out swinging on the eighth pitch of his at-bat in the third.
The strikeout came on an 89 mph splitter.
""Not just him, I think the whole lineup was close to their Opening Day starting lineup,"" Tanaka said through a translator. ""So, it's always good to be able to pitch against guys that will regularly start a game, and you obviously always want to do good against those guys.""
Tanaka allowed two runs, six hits and struck out six over 3 2/3 innings.
Facing reliever Adam Ottavino in the fifth, Harper was awarded first base on catcher's interference and then stole second.
""I said, 'Hey, it's spring training, can I stay here?'"" Harper said. ""[The umpire] said get to first. I tried. I would have liked to get that last at-bat, for sure.""
Harper left Washington as a free agent and signed a record $330 million, 13-year contract with Philadelphia this month.
""Bryce being here and bringing this attention, I think, has a chance to create higher expectations, which can create a higher level of play from our guys,"" Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said. ""And also I think it separates the guys who play with the brightest lights from the guys who can't, and I think that's a great thing for our ballclub.""
Harper walked twice against Toronto on Saturday. He took a 96 mph fastball for strike three from American League Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell and drew a walk from Jalen Beeks in Monday's game against Tampa Bay.
MEETING MR. OCTOBER
Harper talked with Hall of Famer and Yankees adviser Reggie Jackson, who told the six-time All-Star that he is important to the game.
""Definitely humbling,"" Harper said. ""Just to be able to stand there and talk to him and hear what he had to say, it's pretty incredible.""
MULTITASKING
Yankees guest instructor Bernie Williams threw the ceremonial first pitch and played ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" on the guitar while in uniform. The jazz guitarist spent Monday's off day performing in a concert at nearby Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater. He got a loud ovation walking off the field carrying a guitar case over his shoulder.
FRANKLIN'S FAREWELL
Longtime minor league manager and coach Tony Franklin is retiring after spring training, ending a run of 48 years in pro baseball that includes the past 13 with the Yankees. ""I enjoyed every minute,"" Franklin said. Among his assignments with the Yankees were managing Double-A Trenton and rookie-league Pulaski. He also was rehab coach at the Tampa minor league complex.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Phillies OF Odubel Herrera (hamstring) and 2B Cesar Hernandez both had five plate appearances in a minor league game. Hernandez will play Thursday against Pittsburgh, and Herrera will be the DH on Saturday against Houston. ""A realistic scenario for us is to have both of those guys on our Opening Day roster ready to go, fully healthy, timing where it needs to be,"" Kapler said.

26249938,"I don't know if this talent dispersion is a historical anomaly, but I do know the level of talent is unbelievably high these days. As one example, Justin Turner comes in at No. 53 and all he has done the past three seasons is finish ninth, eighth and 14th in the MVP voting. That's a pretty good 53rd-best ballplayer in the majors. The young talent is remarkable, with the likes of Ronald Acuna Jr., Juan Soto and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. all making the top 100 for the first time -- in Guerrero's case, even though he's yet to play a game in the majors.
ESPN's ranking of MLB's best players in the new season. Nos. 1-50 » | 51-100 »
Surprises, reaction » | More MLB Rank »
That leads us to this question: Who's next? For each team, I've nominated one candidate to be the next player from that franchise to appear on MLB Rank -- not necessarily in 2020, but at some point in the future. The only rule: The player can't be on this year's list -- so Mike Trout for the Phillies or Gerrit Cole for the Dodgers doesn't count, as much fun as that would be to speculate. It's OK if a player has appeared on a previous MLB Rank top 100.
The teams are ordered based on points earned in the 2019 rankings: 100 points for the No. 1 player, 99 for No. 2 and so on, down to one point for No. 100. So, argue away ...
Who made it this year?  (7 players, 480 points) -- Alex Bregman (6), Jose Altuve (10), Justin Verlander (22), Carlos Correa (27), Gerrit Cole (30), George Springer (37), Roberto Osuna (95)
Next:  Josh James, RHP
You might have expected to see top prospects Forrest Whitley or Kyle Tucker here, but both were already sent back to minor league camp and might not see Houston for a few months, so they're more on a 2021 or 2022 timetable to crack the top 100. Meanwhile, I'm all-in on James and his 100 mph fastball. His spring training was slowed by a strained groin and he's just getting back on the mound, so he won't be ready for the opening rotation, but when he is, watch out.
Who made it this year?  (9 players, 437 points) -- Aaron Judge (11), Luis Severino (23), Giancarlo Stanton (31), James Paxton (43), Aroldis Chapman (47), Gary Sanchez (67), Gleyber Torres (78), Miguel Andujar (84), Aaron Hicks (88)
Next:  Masahiro Tanaka, RHP
This is interesting. Over the past three seasons, Paxton is 29-18 with a 3.52 ERA over 417 ⅓ innings, while Tanaka -- pitching in much more of a hitters' park -- is 39-22 with a 3.83 ERA over 534 innings. Yet Paxton comes in at No. 43 and Tanaka is unranked. Don't be surprised if Tanaka has the better season and cracks the top 100 next year.
Who made it this year?  (6 players, 412 points) -- Francisco Lindor (8), Jose Ramirez (14), Corey Kluber (16), Trevor Bauer (39), Carlos Carrasco (44), Brad Hand (73)
Next:  Mike Clevinger, RHP
Maybe if Clevinger got into more fights on Twitter and posted videos of his workouts he'd rank higher. Over the past two seasons, Clevinger has quietly posted a 3.05 ERA in 321 ⅔ innings, while his more publicized teammate Bauer has a 3.20 ERA over 351 ⅔ innings. I'm not necessarily saying Clevinger is better, but 2018 was Bauer's first season with an ERA under 4.00. Look for more good things from Clevinger and maybe a higher top-100 ranking next year than Bauer.
Who made it this year?  (7 players, 405 points) -- Mookie Betts (2), Chris Sale (9), J.D. Martinez (17), Andrew Benintendi (50), Xander Bogaerts (57), David Price (69), Nathan Eovaldi (98)
Next:  Eduardo Rodriguez, LHP
Rafael Devers certainly has top-100 potential, but his defense and plate discipline will keep him below that bar for at least another year. The Red Sox feel Rodriguez has the ability to put everything together this year and become a rotation anchor. He has been working on a new slider to go with his 93 mph fastball and outstanding changeup. Various injuries -- knee surgery in 2017, an ankle injury last year -- have limited him to a career high of 24 starts, so he needs to stay healthy and get to 180-plus innings.
Who made it this year?  (6 players, 354 points) -- Max Scherzer (3), Anthony Rendon (32), Juan Soto (35), Stephen Strasburg (46), Patrick Corbin (52), Trea Turner (54)
ESPN Insider Buster Olney discusses the MLB Rank top 100 and more with old friend Jayson Stark on the BBTN podcast. Listen
Next:  Victor Robles, CF
Why did the Nationals ultimately feel comfortable letting Bryce Harper walk? Because they know Robles is ready to step in. Heck, Robles might have cracked this list this year if he hadn't injured his elbow early last season attempting a diving catch in Triple-A. He's a career .300 hitter in the minors, projects as a plus defender in center, will steal some bases and has power potential if he adds a little more launch angle. But even if he's just a 15-homer guy, he has the all-around game to become an All-Star. ZiPS already projects a solid 2.5 WAR for his rookie season.
Who made it this year?  (5 players, 314 points) -- Bryce Harper (15), Aaron Nola (24), J.T. Realmuto (28), Rhys Hoskins (45), Jean Segura (79)
Next:  Nick Pivetta, RHP
The Phillies have reason to be optimistic beyond Harper and all their other offseason acquisitions. Acquired from the Nationals for Jonathan Papelbon in 2015, Pivetta should be near the top of any list of potential breakout pitchers. The stuff is there as evidenced by a 27.1 percent strikeout rate that ranked 13th among qualified starters -- one spot ahead of Nola. The question: Was his .326 BABIP the result of the porous Phillies defense, or does he simply lack the fastball command to make the leap to the next level? He might also be wise to consider ditching his two-seamer (batters hit .379/.471/.569 against it). He's not a lock to improve, but he's the best ""next"" choice for the Phillies given the farm system lacks can't-miss prospects.
Who made it this year?  (6 players, 300 points) -- Clayton Kershaw (41), Walker Buehler (42), Corey Seager (49), Justin Turner (53), Kenley Jansen (60), Cody Bellinger (61)
Next:  Gavin Lux, 2B/SS
Look, if Max Muncy rakes again -- .263/.391/.582 with 35 home runs in 2018 -- he'll crack this list next year. I do believe in his bat, as his ability to control the strike zone should allow him to tap into his power, but some regression in the home run rate is expected (he had the 10th-highest rate of home runs to fly balls), and it's not certain how much he'll play against lefties. So I'll go with one of my favorite minor leaguers in Lux, who had a breakout season, hitting .324/.399/.514 at age 20 between Class A and Double-A. I love the bat-to-ball ability and the left-handed bat, although he'll probably wind up at second base.
Who made it this year?  (6 players, 277 points) -- Jacob deGrom (4), Noah Syndergaard (25), Edwin Diaz (36), Robinson Cano (82), Zack Wheeler (83), Michael Conforto (99)
Next:  Brandon Nimmo, CF
Nimmo became the first Mets hitter to post a .400 OBP since David Wright in 2007; it was just the 11th .400 OBP season in team history. He might be a little stretched on defense in center field, but if he posts another .400 OBP and 4.4 WAR season, he'll easily crack the top 100.
Who made it this year?  (5 players, 228 points) -- Kris Bryant (21), Javier Baez (29), Anthony Rizzo (38), Willson Contreras (92), Jon Lester (97)
Next:  Yu Darvish, RHP
Kyle Hendricks remains criminally underrated with WAR figures of 5.4, 3.5 and 3.5 the past three seasons, good for 10th-best among starting pitchers in total WAR over that span. MLB Rank tends to reward peak value more than consistency, however, and Hendricks is unlikely to come close to the 2.13 ERA he had in 2016. Anyway, Darvish's first season in a Cubs uniform was a disaster, but I'm banking on a comeback and the big strikeout totals that jazz up his reputation.
Who made it this year?  (4 players, 228 points) -- Christian Yelich (7), Josh Hader (33), Lorenzo Cain (56), Yasmani Grandal (80)
Next:  Keston Hiura, 2B

The MLB season will be here before you know it. That means it's time to draft your fantasy baseball team.
Create or join a league today.
Get rankings and more for your draft.
Corbin Burnes and Brandon Woodruff will be intriguing to watch as they move into the rotation, but let's see if their stuff plays up as well as it did out of the bullpen last season. Hiura is the team's top prospect, the ninth overall pick in 2017 out of UC Irvine with a highly regarded bat. He reached Double-A last year and hit .293/.357/.464 between two levels with 13 home runs in 485 at-bats. I'd like to see him improve his walk rate (just 36 walks in 535 plate appearances), and he'll really have to hit as his glove isn't considered special.
Who made it this year?  (5 players, 225 points) -- Nolan Arenado (5), Trevor Story (48), Charlie Blackmon (55), German Marquez (81), Kyle Freeland (91)
Next:  Brendan Rodgers, SS/2B
I'm still a Jon Gray believer, but I'll go with the more obvious choice in Rodgers, the team's top prospect. I'm not completely sold on Rodgers: The one minor league stop where he has put up monster numbers was at Class A Lancaster, which is like Coors Field on steroids. He doesn't walk much or run much, and with Trevor Story entrenched at shortstop, his future position with the Rockies will be second base, which puts even more pressure on the bat. He'll spend this season at Triple-A and figures to compete with Garrett Hampson and Ryan McMahon for the starting job in 2020. Hmm, maybe Gray does put it all together and beats Rodgers into the top 100.
Who made it this year?  (4 players, 218 points) -- Freddie Freeman (18), Ronald Acuna Jr. (20), Ozzie Albies (58), Josh Donaldson (90)
Next:  Touki Toussaint, RHP
Mike Foltynewicz couldn't quite crack the top 100 even after a 2.85 ERA in 2018, but maybe the voters were right. His season was heavily BABIP influenced, and now he's out with a sore elbow and will miss his Opening Day start. Ender Inciarte (No. 98 last year) has an argument as a three-time Gold Glove winner in center field, but I'm going with one of the Braves' young pitchers. Toussaint isn't likely to be an overnight sensation, and he might even end up in the bullpen long term, but his stuff is ridiculous, and if he puts it together he has more upside than more polished arms Kyle Wright or Mike Soroka.
Who made it this year?  (4 players, 179 points) -- Paul Goldschmidt (13), Matt Carpenter (40), Miles Mikolas (76), Marcell Ozuna (96)
Next:  Jack Flaherty, RHP
This one is easy. I love Harrison Bader, but he's probably more Kevin Pillar than peak Kevin Kiermaier, whereas Flaherty has Cy Young potential -- the staff ace the Cardinals kept expecting Carlos Martinez to grow into. As a rookie, Flaherty's strikeout rate ranked 10th among pitchers with at least 150 innings and his .199 batting average allowed ranked ninth. He has looked sharp already this spring, including one outing when he fanned nine in four innings. Flaherty should not only crack the top 100, but I look for him to crack the top 50.
Who made it this year?  (4 players, 169 points) -- Matt Chapman (34), Blake Treinen (51), Khris Davis (63), Matt Olson (87)
Next:  Stephen Piscotty, RF
He's not flashy, but Piscotty hit .267/.331/.491 with 27 home runs and 41 doubles, including a .272/.337/.536 line in the second half. His walk rate fell from 13.0 percent in 2017 to 6.9 percent, so if he can reverse that and improve his OBP, he'll slide into the back end of the top 100.
Who made it this year?  (3 players, 164 points) -- Mike Trout (1), Andrelton Simmons (64), Shohei Ohtani (74)
Next:  Jo Adell, OF
Justin Upton is certainly capable of top-100 numbers in any given season, or maybe Matt Harvey finds a time machine and travels back to 2015, but Adell, a consensus top-10 overall prospect, is the best bet. He reached Double-A last year at 19 after starting in the Midwest League, surprising even the Angels with his rapid ascent after they tabbed him with the 10th pick in the 2017 draft. He has already grown into his big-boy body, and he has future star written all over him. He could reach the majors later this year and team with Trout in the Angels outfield in 2020 and maybe crack this list in 2022 ... with hopes that Trout is still alongside him.
Who made it this year?  (5 players, 130 points) -- Joey Votto (26), Eugenio Suarez (77), Raisel Iglesias (85), Yasiel Puig (93), Scooter Gennett (94)
Next:  Nick Senzel, CF/IF
Keith Law's No. 6 overall prospect is the logical answer here. Senzel has done nothing but rake since getting drafted second overall in 2016 with a .314/.390/.513 line in the minors. He's a natural third baseman, but the Reds are trying him out in center field this spring, taking advantage of his athleticism to fill the team's biggest hole. The obvious concern is health. He missed time last year with vertigo and a broken finger, then had elbow surgery to remove bone spurs.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 89 points) -- Blake Snell (12)
Next:  Tommy Pham, LF
It speaks to the impressive depth the Rays have built that they won 90 games last year and yet only one of their players cracked the top 100. Pham finished 11th in the MVP voting with the Cardinals in 2017, but an awful two-month slump in May and June last year sent him to Tampa, where he posted a 1.071 OPS in 39 games. Pham was No. 78 on this list last year, and I'm taking the over on his 2.7 WAR projection from ZiPS for another top-100 ranking.
In his first exclusive interview since joining the Phillies, Bryce Harper goes deep on rejecting $300 million, recruiting Mike Trout and playing in Philly for life. Tim Keown
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 82 points) -- Manny Machado (19)
Next:  Fernando Tatis Jr., SS
Look, it could be almost any of the Padres' promising youngsters: Joey Lucchesi or Luis Urias or Francisco Mejia or Franmil Reyes or Chris Paddack. Heck, maybe Wil Myers has a bounce-back season, and let's not forget Eric Hosmer was on this list 12 months ago. But everyone is already drooling about a Machado-Tatis left side of the infield, with good reason. Tatis will need some time in Triple-A, and he'll have to curb some swing-and-miss issues, but he should be a star by 2021.
Who made it this year?  (2 players, 69 points) -- Buster Posey (62), Madison Bumgarner (71)
Next:  Joey Bart, C
I mean ... look, Brandon Belt and Brandon Crawford aren't washed up, but you can't really project them as top-100 players moving forward. Maybe Bart is the next Buster Posey, but he's a catcher entering his first full professional season, so he's several years away. Considering Bumgarner could get traded and Posey is returning from hip surgery, it's possible the Giants have nobody on this list next year.
Who made it this year?  (2 players, 36 points) -- Jameson Taillon (66), Starling Marte (100)
Next:  Ke'Bryan Hayes, 3B
Hayes ranked 18th on Keith Law's prospect list, thanks to a glove that Law said makes Hayes ""a likely 80-grade defender at third base with unbelievable hands and instincts."" He's still growing into his power -- he hit seven home runs in Double-A -- but he controls the strike zone and should hit for average. He's a unique prospect, but it seems the worst-case scenario is peak Placido Polanco, and that's a top-100 player.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 36 points) -- Zack Greinke (65)
Next:  Robbie Ray, LHP
Ray was on this last a year ago at No. 49, but scuffled through some injuries and went 6-2 with a 3.93 ERA over 24 starts. (And, yes, getting only eight decisions was weird; he's the first pitcher with that many starts and so few decisions in MLB history, not including Tampa Bay opener Ryne Stanek). The stuff is still filthy -- 165 K's in 123⅔ innings -- and he finished strong with a 3.23 ERA in the second half.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 33 points) -- Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (68)
Next:  Danny Jansen, C
This is a tough one since Vladdy Jr. would have been the obvious choice except he's the rare rookie to crack the top 100. Marcus Stroman is a bounce-back possibility, but if he pitches well he's a candidate to be traded in July, so he might make this list in 2020 for a different team. Let's go with Jansen, the rare catching prospect who can hit. He posted an .884 OPS in 2017 and .863 at Triple-A in 2018. He controls the strike zone (44 walks, 49 strikeouts), and if he can post an .800 OPS in the majors, he's going to make some All-Star teams.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 31 points) -- Mitch Haniger (70)
Next:  Yusei Kikuchi, LHP
This offseason, the Mariners traded away four players in the top 100 -- Edwin Diaz, James Paxton, Jean Segura and Robinson Cano. With them, Seattle would have ranked 13th in our points system, between the Braves and Cardinals, but instead rank 23rd with its lone representative. They also don't have a clear candidate to crack this list anytime soon. Marco Gonzales is a nice midrotation starter, and Justus Sheffield and Justin Dunn are good pitching prospects, but hardly sure things. Jarred Kelenic, acquired in the Diaz trade, was just drafted last year and is years away. So how about Kikuchi? He's a polished veteran lefty, and a lot of Japanese pitchers seem to do well their first season in the majors. He could sneak his way in to the bottom of the top 100 next year.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 29 points) -- Jose Berrios (72)
Next:  Byron Buxton, CF
Coming off a wild-card berth in 2017, the Twins had three players on this list last year: Buxton (No. 56), Brian Dozier (No. 60) and Miguel Sano (No. 77). Things could not have gone worse for that trio as they combined for just 0.2 WAR and each battled injuries as the Twins fell under .500. Buxton's projections are wildly unpredictable, but we know he can play center field. If he stays healthy and hits even a little bit, he's a valuable player.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 26 points) -- Whit Merrifield (75)
Next:  Adalberto Mondesi, SS
Mondesi is already a top-100 fantasy player heading into 2019 because of his ability to swipe 50 bags, but I'm not sold on him reaching the top 100 on this list just yet. He had a terrible strikeout-to-walk ratio of 77-11, and batted-ball data said he was fortunate to produce an OPS of .804. Still, he can run and his defensive metrics were above average.
Who made it this year?  (1 player, 12 points) -- Jose Abreu (89)
Next:  Eloy Jimenez, RF
For the second straight year, Abreu is the lone White Sox player on the list, and this ranking is rather generous given his mediocre 1.7-WAR campaign in 2018. The rebuild has gone slower than expected as youngsters such as Yoan Moncada and Lucas Giolito have struggled and Michael Kopech had Tommy John surgery in August. Jimenez, however, looks like the real deal -- Keith Law's No. 5 prospect. He's the rare power prospect who doesn't strike out much, and he's ready to make an immediate impact in 2019.
Who made it this year? Nobody
Next:  Jose Leclerc, RHP
Nine relief pitchers made the top 100, but not Leclerc, who had a 1.56 ERA and was the toughest pitcher to hit (.126 average, one home run) in 2018. The Rangers just signed him to a four-year, $14.75 extension that also includes two option years. Leclerc should make that contract look like a steal. Then again, baseball history is littered with relief pitchers who had 50 great innings, and Leclerc is one season removed from walking 40 batters in 45 innings.
Just over two weeks before Opening Day, two prominent free agents remain available. We find realistic landing spots and outside-the-box fits for both pitchers.
The games don't count. The numbers won't make the back of any baseball cards. But in camps across the Cactus and Grapefruit leagues, what happens now could still make a difference.
In our spring MLB stock watch, we examine who gained (and lost) the most wins during the offseason with the biggest names finally off the market.
Who made it this year? Nobody
Next:  Casey Mize, RHP
I really wanted to list Miguel Cabrera, but he has been worth minus-0.2 WAR the past two seasons. At age 36, you can't really predict a big comeback -- but that doesn't mean he can't have one. Let's go with Mize, last year's No. 1 overall pick who should advance quickly through the minors.
Who made it this year? Nobody
Next:  Brian Anderson, 3B/RF
Anderson had 3.9 WAR as a rookie last year -- a higher figure than Juan Soto, Walker Buehler, Gleyber Torres and Miguel Andujar. He's not flashy, but he hit .273, has doubles power, draws some walks and did well playing two positions. All he needs to do is improve a little bit across the board. The ZiPS projection has him at 2.7 WAR and not improving at the plate -- he does turn 26 in May -- but I think there's top-100 potential here.
Who made it this year? Nobody
Next:  DL Hall, LHP
It's possible the next top-100 player for the Orioles isn't even in the organization yet. Hall is the only prospect to crack Law's top 100 (at No. 63) after dominating the South Atlantic League in his first full professional season. Still, it's a long way from low-A to the majors, so he's several years from making any impact.

26024776,"Two weeks ago was MLB The Show photo day at Tampa Bay Rays camp. Ten new Rays needed to be added to the game for the 2019 release, so a crew from the game company set up 46 cameras to take 46 simultaneous high-definition photos from 360 degrees. Using proprietary software, the images were sent off to Sony, where animators will produce the digital version of each player.
Bryce Harper won't be wearing any of Washington's 18 potential threads this spring, but there is a 6-foot 45-pounder in the clubhouse who will. And he might be making history.
The long offseason wait is over -- let the games begin! -- giving us a chance to focus on what will happen between the lines.
The contract is his. Now, starting tomorrow and for 13 years to come, it's time to get to work.
Rays lefty Ryan Yarbrough not only grew up playing MLB The Show, but still plays it. He grew up a Rays fan in Florida, so Scott Kazmir was a big favorite for him, and he always liked Mark Buehrle, who was ""a big hero"" of his as a fellow southpaw who relied more on craftsmanship than velocity.
Yarbrough was going to get the game regardless but will get a kick out of seeing himself in it for the first time.
""It's kind of scary how close some guys look to their real selves,"" he said. ""Last year, I remember a couple guys joking that it was like looking in a mirror. And other guys were like, 'Do they not like me or something? What happened?' So it's fun to see how it comes out.""
Teammate Ryne Stanek also grew up playing the game and will be in it for the first time.
""I'm still a video game guy,"" he laughed, admitting he brings his Xbox with him on the road (which means he can't play MLB The Show, which is available only for PlayStation). ""I play everything. It's pretty much, if they make it, I play it, which is a problem. It was pretty cool to see what goes into what makes a player actually look like a player in the game.""
He had to make what he called a ""scrunchy face."" The photo shoot for each player lasts about five minutes and they're asked to make different facial expressions for whatever might happen on the field. After all, you never know when you might get mad at an umpire.
Stanek was a Cardinals fan growing up, and throughout high school and college at Arkansas, he'd always play with the Cardinals.
""I'd throw with Adam Wainwright, and he's still here,"" Stanek said. ""And Chris Carpenter. Those were the guys that were always starting whenever I played.""
The Rays are known for their analytics, but one thing they don't have data on: a pitcher's ERA on days he plays video games and days he doesn't play video games. ""We should probably track that,"" Stanek laughed. ""That would be interesting. I mean, I would say my ERA based on the days I play and don't play would be pretty much identical since I pretty much play every day before I go to the field.""
Aaron Sokol, a licensing manager for the MLB Players Association, was on site to help monitor the shoot. There were two crews in Florida and two in Arizona, hitting a team a day. His team was heading up to Sarasota next to shoot the Pirates.
""When you do the younger guys now, the 22-to-25-year-olds, they play the game, so they're really into this, making sure they look good, but the older guys are like, 'What is this? I don't care.'""
Indeed, Rays rookie second baseman Brandon Lowe, who performed well in a 43-game stint in the majors in 2018, said he and his spring training roommate, minor league outfielder Ryan Boldt, drafted teams this spring and already played a World Series. Lowe won in six games. His first pick: Mookie Betts.
Compare that to 30-year-old veteran Tommy Pham. He doesn't quite get the whole video game thing, although he admitted to playing some Mortal Kombat as a kid.
""I'd rather spend my time a little more productive[ly],"" he smiled. ""We do have some down time. Last year when I was on the Cardinals, they had a Fortnite crew. They used to bring their consoles into the hotel rooms and just set up shop and play. Hey, whatever gets them prepared for the game, I guess.""

Padres outfielder Wil Myers got in trouble last season, however, when teammate Carlos Asuaje was streaming online while playing Fortnite. Myers could be heard in the background criticizing manager Andy Green for calling a practice session the next day to work on cutoffs and relays -- in September.
""Oh my god. It's so miserable, man. It's insane,"" Myers said. ""Andy could not be any worse than he is right now.""
At which time Asuaje informed him, ""Dude, I'm streaming this.""
Stanek said he doesn't stream and only plays teammates or former teammates or friends from back home. He also said the Fortnite craze might already be subsiding.
""Apex Legends just came out and a lot of people like that,"" he said. ""I'm not really sold. Maybe just because I spent so much time on Fortnite and it makes me mad I have to change everything now.""
The MLBPA operates a group license for MLB The Show. Royalties from the game are pooled with other royalties -- like jersey sales -- and distributed equally among all active major leaguers. So Aaron Judge, even though he had the highest-selling jersey, doesn't receive a bigger check than any other player. It's also based on service time for the current season. A player called up in August won't receive as much as a player on the Opening Day roster.
A player also can't appear in MLB The Show until he appears in the majors. Sokol said they will do photo shoots of some of the hot rookies expected to get called up, like Vladimir Guerrero Jr. The game will cycle through veteran players every four or five years, or maybe if they change their facial hair. James Paxton, for example, had to shave his beard after getting traded to the Yankees, so he'll get a new image for the game.
In 2003, Barry Bonds opted out of the union in order to pursue his own licensing agreements. That meant his name and likeness didn't appear in video games (Michael Jordan also did this). Bonds was replaced by a player named Reggie Stocker, who just happened to hit and perform like Bonds.
Compare that to Yarbrough's attitude: He said the players even look forward to seeing their ratings -- in his case, even if his fastball is more Mark Buehrle than Scott Kazmir.

26234314,"We've unveiled out MLB Rank top 100 (100-51 and 50-1), so now we're asking our panel of baseball writers for reactions -- and we're asking you for your takes as well.
Surprises, reaction to top 100 | How did we do last year? | More MLB Rank
David Schoenfield: Nothing really jumps out at me as an egregious surprise. I'm a little surprised that Alex Bregman at No. 7 ranked higher than Jose Ramirez at No. 14, mostly because Ramirez has had back-to-back top-three MVP finishes, while Bregman has had just one big season. I'm a little surprised that Joey Votto fell only 17 spots to No. 26. While he led the NL in OBP, he had just 12 home runs and 42 extra-base hits -- not the kind of power production you expect from a first baseman. Of course, both Bregman and Votto are eminently capable of justifying their rankings.
Bradford Doolittle: I think probably too many of us have jumped off the Kris Bryant bandwagon a little too quickly. He's still a top-10 or top-15 player in my book, so No. 21 is a little light. Are we really saying we'd take J.D. Martinez over him? Blake Snell? Still and all, though, I think this was a pretty solid ranking of players.
Eddie Matz: Nothing jumps out at me, really. I'd classify J.T. Realmuto (No. 28) as someone who maybe hopped out at me. I mean, there's no denying that he's a quality player on both sides of the ball. But top-30 seems a little high to me. Maybe all the offseason trade buzz filtered in here somehow and pushed him about 10 or 15 spots ahead of where he should be. I definitely wouldn't put him ahead of Anthony Rendon.
Sam Miller: Nobody is going to make the top 30 about whom I'm going to have much bad to say, but if I'm picking somebody I could most easily see falling into the 70s or 80s after this year, it'd be Blake Snell (No. 12). His track record as a truly elite pitcher is short, and he still has to work around more walks than his peers at the top of this list. Here we have him as the fourth-best pitcher in baseball; according to ZiPS, to pick one projection system, he's ""only"" 17th. That's still phenomenal, but it's a tier below this.
Schoenfield: A little too high. The guy two spots below him is Mitch Haniger, who produced a 6.1-WAR season in 2018. The only 20-year-old position players to produce even 5.0 WAR since 1960 are Johnny Bench, Ken Griffey Jr., Jason Heyward, Manny Machado and Mike Trout. There's no doubt that Vladdy Jr. can hit, but I'm not sure he's the all-around player those guys were, and I'm not completely convinced he's going to be a big-time power hitter at age 20.
A major shake-up brings a new crew of All-Stars to the forefront, with some of the game's biggest names on the outside looking in.
Leading off our countdown of the game's best, youngsters duel with historic greats. Which players landed on the back half of our list?
Doolittle: A tad high. Certainly Ronald Acuna Jr. and Juan Soto showed that very young standout prospects can have immediate impacts. Guerrero is more than capable of following in their shoes. But in terms of expectation for his rookie season, somewhere in the 80-90 range is probably more appropriate. But 68 is a reasonable slot. I actually thought it might be higher, just because the hype machine has been so relentless.
Matz: My gut says he's too high and that for all the (justifiable) hype, it's time for a little brake-pumping. Then again, last year's stud rookies (Acuna and Soto) finished 42nd and 43rd in position player WAR last season. Mix in the pitchers and that puts them in the 60-something range. So it comes down to this: Will Vlad Jr. make as much of an impact as Acuna and Soto did last season? Maybe. But the fact that he's already dinged up (oblique) casts some doubt.
Miller: Boy, I don't know. I see my colleagues here saying ""too high,"" but then I look at most of the names around him and none of them makes me happy like Vladito makes me happy. So I'm saying too low. Going just by how happy he makes me, he should probably be second on this list. He hasn't done anything to prove that he belongs in the top tier of this list, but he has done even less to disprove it.
Schoenfield: Cody Bellinger fell off from his big rookie season, so he slid 38 spots, from No. 23 to No. 61. I think he's going to have a better season, with more home runs, a better walk rate and a higher OBP. In fact, he's on my short list of NL MVP candidates.
ESPN Insider Buster Olney discusses the MLB Rank top 100 and more with old friend Jayson Stark on the BBTN podcast. Listen
Doolittle: I'm naming two, since they are both Dodgers and rated closely together: Corey Seager (No. 49) and Justin Turner (No. 53). Both are easily top-30 players if healthy, and by all appearances, they appear to be. If Seager can get into 140-150 games, he's probably more like top-15 and is more than capable of making a run at National League MVP. Dave is right about Bellinger as well.
Matz: Like Brad, I'm all aboard the Turner train -- the other Turner. Trea Turner isn't the .342 hitter that his rookie season suggested. But he isn't the .271 guy he was last season, either. Somewhere in between lies the truth. His plate discipline was much improved last year (69 walks), and his power will continue to come (19 HRs in 2018). If Adam Eaton stays healthy at the top of the Nats lineup and with a full year of Juan Soto hitting behind him, Turner (No. 54) could be in for a big year.
Miller: German Marquez (No. 81) had a 2.61 ERA in the second half last year and backed it up with 12 strikeouts per nine innings and six K's for every walk. His K rate went up every month of the season, and in September, he struck out 37.5 percent of batters -- a mark that only Max Scherzer, Gerrit Cole, Chris Sale, Blake Snell, Justin Verlander and James Paxton managed to top in any month last season. He did all this as a Rockie. He's a miracle.
Schoenfield: Mookie Betts is the obvious candidate since you can argue that 2018 was the first season when there actually was somebody better than Trout. But my other choice is Juan Soto because he has a chance to be the best hitter in the game, cranking out .450 OBPs with 35-plus home runs. What he did as a teenager -- .292/.406/.517 -- was so unfathomably impressive that I might even be underestimating his upside.
In his first exclusive interview since joining the Phillies, Bryce Harper goes deep on rejecting $300 million, recruiting Mike Trout and playing in Philly for life. Tim Keown
Doolittle: This is the topic for my column running on Friday, so I must abstain. Stay tuned.
Matz: Mookie Betts. I know, boring pick, but it's pure logic here. If Trout isn't the best player in baseball, then Mookie is. If Trout stumbles for some reason (injury or otherwise), Mookie's the obvious heir to the throne. He's only 26, so the five-year hypothetical window takes him to age 31, at which point he'll still be at or near his prime. After Betts, my order of succession is Lindor, Bregman, Acuna.
Miller: Francisco Lindor is an elite shortstop who just hit 38 homers and stole 25 bases as a 24-year-old. His 7.9 WAR last season is already better than that of the average MVP winner, he draws a few more walks each year, and he's still carrying a ton of doubles that might turn into even more home runs. Mookie, of course, must be mentioned, but Lindor's stats at 23-24 have looked a fair bit like Alex Rodriguez's at 22-23.
On Monday, prior to the results being known, we asked our writers for their predictions as to who would be underranked and overranked. Here's whom they picked, with the actual rankings in parentheses:
Most likely to be underranked
Matz: Ozzie Albies (58) or Trea Turner (54)
Doolittle: Cody Bellinger (61)
Miller: Carlos Correa (27)
Schoenfield: Brandon Nimmo (unranked)
Most likely to be overranked
Matz: Christian Yelich (7) or Lorenzo Cain (56)
Doolittle: Vlad Guerrero Jr. (68)
Miller: Khris Davis (63)
Schoenfield: Some closer, perhaps Edwin Diaz (36)
Who was right? Only time will tell.

26085158,"Third baseman Todd Frazier injured his left oblique muscle and will return to New York for a cortisone injection, the second Mets infielder to get hurt at spring training after fellow infielder Jed Lowrie.
The 33-year-old Frazier had an MRI that revealed the injury.
""I was hitting the ball great, and then I felt a little tightness in my left side,'' Frazier said Tuesday.
Frazier said he had not experienced the injury before.
""I thought I was doing everything right,'' he said. ""I'm frustrated, very frustrated myself. It's just one of those things where you come into the year all healthy and ready to roll and this happens. It's not fun.''
Frazier hit 18 homers and drove in 59 runs in 115 games last year, when he went on the disabled list for the first two times in his big league career. He was out from May 8 to June 2 with a left hamstring strain and from July 9 to Aug. 2 with a left ribcage muscle strain.
He altered his approach to spring training this year.
""I wanted to try something different -- going slow. And this has to happen,'' Frazier said. ""It's not the best start. Luckily it happened in spring training and we can nip this thing in the bud and get ready for the season.''
New general manager Brodie Van Wagenen isn't sure of the seriousness of Frazier's injury.
""It's hard to tell. I think with obliques it's sort of a day-to-day progression to see how it evolves. The MRI wasn't overly alarming, but clearly, we're going to shut him down and start building him up from there,'' Van Wagenen said.
Lowrie, 34, is not participating in baseball activities because of pain in the back of his left knee. Van Wagenen said Jeff McNeil, who has been spending time in left field, will continue to play there early in spring training but could be moved to third later.

26211415,"Yankees manager Aaron Boone announced the decision before Saturday night's spring training game with the Orioles.
Tanaka is replacing Severino, who will not make the start at Yankee Stadium because of right-shoulder inflammation. Severino was scratched from his first planned start of spring training Tuesday after feeling discomfort after throwing his first slider in a pregame bullpen session.
Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Wednesday he might employ a version of the opener on occasion this season with injuries already ravaging the upper echelon of his starting rotation.
The Yankees increased the 2019 salaries of a few of their young stars, including Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez.
""Masa has clearly shown through his life really that he's really good in the big spot,"" Boone said.
Yankees newcomer James Paxton will start the second game and J.A. Happ, both left-handers, will pitch the third game against the Orioles.
Tanaka, 30, discussed what it means to start the opener after his outing Friday night against the Detroit Tigers.
""Obviously, if you're given the opportunity to pitch on that day, you want to go out and do your best,"" the right-hander said through an interpreter. ""If you look back, I don't think I've necessarily been good on opening days. I've gotten some experience. We've gone through playoffs. So, if that situation were to arise, I can go out there and give a good performance.""
Tanaka has made three previous Opening Day starts (2015-17) for the Yankees. New York lost all three games, with Tanaka charged with the loss in two.
Severino had his first Opening Day assignment in 2018.
Tanaka was 12-6 with 3.75 ERA in 27 starts last season.
CC COMING ALONG
LHP CC Sabathia threw 31 pitches in his fourth bullpen session and said afterward that his first batting practice outing is likely next. The 38-year-old had a stent inserted in December after a blockage was found in an artery from his heart, and he has had chronic right-knee problems that required several operations. Sabathia, retiring after the season, is expected to miss his first two or three regular-season starts.

26190498,"Those three rule changes are among a wide variety of experiments that the Atlantic League will run this season as part of its new partnership with Major League Baseball. The changes, announced Friday, include:
• Using a TrackMan radar system to help umpires call balls and strikes
• Extending the distance between the pitching rubber from 60 feet, 6 inches to 62 feet, 6 inches in the second half of the season
• Mandating that two infielders are on each side of the second-base bag when a pitch is released, with the penalty being a ball
• A three-batter minimum for pitchers -- a rule MLB and the MLB Players Association are considering for the 2020 season as they near an agreement on a smaller set of changes
• No mound visits, other than for pitching changes or injuries
• Increasing the size of first, second and third base from 15 inches to 18 inches
• Reducing the time between innings and pitching changes from 2 minutes, 5 seconds to 1 minute, 45 seconds
While MLB has long tested potential rule changes in the minor leagues, its three-year partnership with the Atlantic League -- an eight-team league that features former major leaguers trying to return to affiliated ball -- offers the ability to try more radical rules.
Major League Baseball's new partner is breaking out some drastic rule changes. Here's what the Atlantic League innovations mean and how likely they are to hit the majors.
""This first group of experimental changes is designed to create more balls in play, defensive action, baserunning, and improve player safety,"" Morgan Sword, MLB senior vice president, league economics and operations, said in a statement. ""We look forward to seeing them in action in the Atlantic League.""
MLB has chafed at using technology to replace ball-and-strike-calling duties for umpires, fearful that it's not yet consistent enough to warrant implementation. While MLB has used a 60-foot-6 mound distance since 1893, the strikeout spike and lack of balls in play led league officials to wonder what effect a longer distance would have. Commissioner Rob Manfred has suggested banning infield shifts, and with the TrackMan system installed at Atlantic League stadiums, MLB will have a trove of data to analyze and see the effect of doing so.
Entering its 21st season, the Atlantic League has eight teams: the High Point Rockers in High Point, North Carolina; Long Island Ducks in Central Islip, New York; New Britain Bees in New Britain, Connecticut; Somerset Patriots in Bridgewater, New Jersey; Lancaster Barnstormers in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in Waldorf, Maryland; Sugar Land Skeeters in Sugar Land, Texas; and York Revolution in York, Pennsylvania.
