25952644,"Lindor, one of baseball's best all-around players, sustained the injury recently while working out in Orlando, Florida. He was checked Wednesday at the Cleveland Clinic by Dr. Mark Schickendantz, who confirmed a moderate sprain.
Francisco Lindor has sustained a right calf strain while preparing for ST. He has started rehab & is expected to return to Major League game activity in 7-to-9 weeks.Get well soon & keep smiling! We are confident that everyone will handle this news calmly & rationally ... pic.twitter.com/x19uXFClGC
The Indians anticipate Lindor being out up to nine weeks, which would place his return sometime in early April. Cleveland opens the regular season on March 28 in Minnesota.
Bigger rosters? A universal DH? Punishment for tanking teams? We weigh what shaking up the national pastime will do to the game.
The loss of Lindor for any period is a major blow to the three-time defending American League Central champions. Lindor, 25, is an offensive force and elite defensive player, and he is being counted on to provide more leadership this season following the departures of outfielder Michael Brantley and catcher Yan Gomes.
A three-time All-Star, Lindor batted .277 with 38 homers, 92 RBIs and was tied for the league lead with 129 runs.
If Lindor isn't ready for opening day, Indians manager Terry Francona has some options at shortstop. One choice could be All-Star third baseman Jose Ramirez, who has played 109 games at short.
Last month, Lindor signed a one-year, $10.55 million contract for 2019 to avoid salary arbitration with Cleveland. He has previously declined to sign a long-term deal with the club.

25945731,"Whether this is the big move or the move before their signature move, this is a major upgrade for the Phillies. Realmuto led all major league catchers in 2018 with 4.3 Baseball-Reference WAR (4.8 on FanGraphs). Before the trade, the duo of Alfaro and Andrew Knapp projected as next-to-worst in the majors with 1.1 WAR, so this looks at least like a three- to four-win upgrade for the Phillies, at least on the offensive side of the ball.
Days before spring training begins, the offseason's marquee name is adding suitors instead of making his way to camp with a new team. Here's what MLB must do to repair its busted hot stove.
Small-market teams aren't watching rich teams sign all the top free agents anymore. They're watching rich teams sign all the top free agents -- at discounts.
Spring training is almost here. Check out reporting dates for teams in Florida and Arizona, including the defending champion Red Sox.
Realmuto hit .277/.340/.484 with 21 home runs in 125 games for the Phillies, but his numbers should spike going from Marlins Park to Citizens Bank Park. His OPS was nearly 100 points higher on the road in 2018 -- .870 versus .773 - and more than 200 points higher over the past three seasons (.887 versus .682). Assuming he maintains his power production from last season, he should be a 25-homer guy in hitter-friendly Citizens Bank. ESPN Stats & Information reports that Realmuto's slugging percentage on fly balls was 41 percent below average at Marlins Park over the past three seasons, but 17 percent above average in all other parks.
Given his speed (he's an above-average runner and the fastest catcher in the game) and on-base skills, he slots in nicely at the top of the Phillies' lineup that now looks something like this:
SS Jean Segura
C Realmuto
LF Andrew McCutchen
1B Rhys Hoskins
CF Odubel Herrera
RF Nick Williams
2B Cesar Hernandez
3B Maikel Franco
Realmuto is under team control for two more seasons and the Phillies would certainly try to sign him to an extension. He has also become one of the top defensive catchers in the game. His average pop time on throws to second base of 1.90 seconds led all catchers in 2018 and his pitch-framing metrics have also improved to above-average the past two seasons. He didn't win a Gold Glove, but he's a strong candidate to win one in 2019.
Acquiring a catcher of this ability via trade is -- as you may guess -- extremely rare. Good catchers are difficult to find and if you have one, you tend to hoard him like a puppy with his new chew toy. The last catcher traded coming off a season of at least 4.0 bWAR was A.J. Pierznyski in the 2003-04 offseason, when the Twins traded him to the Giants for Joe Nathan and Boof Bonser.
The catcher position is also extremely weak across the majors at this time, at least offensively. Catchers combined for an OPS+ of 87 in 2018, their lowest collective figure since 2001. In other words, this move is arguably the biggest move a team has made this offseason. Before the trade, I had the Phillies a clear fourth in the NL East behind the Nationals, Braves and Mets, and this trade puts them right up there with the Braves and Mets.
That also means there is room for improvement, and that could still mean signing Harper or Machado. That lineup above is nice, but now let's imagine it with Bryce Harper in it. They are also obviously down on Maikel Franco, and Mike Moustakas would be about a two-win upgrade over Franco while providing better balance to the offense since he hits from the left side. So the Phillies are not far away from Gabe Kapler being able to fill out a lineup card that looks like this when they open against the Braves on March 28:
SS Jean Segura
C J.T. Realmuto
RF Bryce Harper
1B Rhys Hoskins
CF Odubel Herrera
LF Andrew McCutchen
3B Mike Moustakas
2B Cesar Hernandez
That would send a pretty clear message that Philadelphia is serious about taking the top spot of the NL East away from Atlanta.
Or maybe the Phillies use money earmarked for Harper or Machado on some combination of Dallas Keuchel. Signing Keuchel would give them one of the deeper rotations in the league:
Aaron Nola
Keuchel
Jake Arrieta
Nick Pivetta
Zach Eflin
Jerad Eickhoff
Enyel De Los Santos
With that group, Vince Velasquez could move to the bullpen where he could be a multi-inning threat, helping set up David Robertson and Seranthony Dominguez.
Which talented stars of tomorrow found a home on this year's list?
• Individual players: Just Missed | Top 100: 100-51  | 50-1 | Impact 20
• Team rankings: Ranking all 30 farm systems | AL East | AL Central | AL West | NL East | NL Central | NL West
To get Realmuto, Matt Klentak did what the Dodgers or Astros wouldn't do: Surrender their top prospect. Sanchez is a hard-throwing right-hander who made just eight starts in 2018 due to elbow inflammation but still ranked No. 35 on Keith Law's top 100 prospects. In his report on Sanchez, Law begins: Sanchez throws what might be the easiest 100 mph fastball in pro baseball, and he does so from a small, 5-foot-10 frame (despite being officially listed at 6 feet) that makes it hard to believe you saw what you just saw when he does it. 
It's a high-risk profile, but there is ace potential. Alfaro is a similar player with loud tools. We've been hearing about him forever -- he was a top 100 prospect for five seasons -- and he finally played his first full season in the majors, hitting .264/.324/.407. Trouble is, that came with an awful 138/18 strikeout-to-walk ratio, and Alfaro's lack of plate discipline has always prevented him from fully tapping into his power. That .264 average is also unsustainable given his current approach since it resulted from a .406 BABIP -- 19 points higher than anyone else in the majors. Because of that he projects as a sub-.300 OBP hitter, and if even he improves on defense that low OBP is always going to hold down his value. Really, the upside is a Mike Zunino-type with power, low OBP and good defense. That's not a bad player, but it pressure on Sanchez to come through to make the trade work for the Marlins.

25990636,"Fister's agent, Page Odle, told MLB.com that the 35-year-old had several contract offers but wanted to spend time with his family.
""He's been contemplating this for a couple months,"" Odle said. ""The main reason is that he wants to start a new chapter in his life. This is 100 percent family-driven.""
The lanky right-hander was 1-7 for the Texas Rangers last season after signing a one-year, $4 million contract.
His best season came in 2014, when he went 16-6 with a 2.41 ERA in 25 starts for the Washington Nationals.
Fister was a mainstay on the Detroit Tigers staff from 2011 to '13, and he also pitched for the Houston Astros, Boston Red Sox and Seattle Mariners.

25974774,"The country music legend will spend just over a week participating in spring training with the Pittsburgh Pirates, reporting Monday with the pitchers and catchers.
The 57-year-old has previously been in the camps of the San Diego Padres (1999), New York Mets (2000) and Kansas City Royals (2004). His workouts start Thursday.
""As a celebrity, they haven't cut me yet, so we'll see,"" Brooks said with a laugh after taking ground balls at third base and fly balls in the outfield. ""You've got to use your advantages, you know. Before you could crowd the plate all you want because nobody wanted to hit you. You haven't got speed. You haven't got fielding. You haven't got hitting. So, use the other thing you've got.""
Brooks is briefly returning to the sport to mark the 20th anniversary of the Garth Brooks Teammates for Kids Foundation, which has raised more than $100 million for children's charities. The foundation pairs children with professional athletes.

25943397,"On this, the 97th day of free agency, four days before the first pitchers and catchers report to spring training, less than six weeks ahead of Major League Baseball opening its regular season, the two best free agents in more than a decade remain unemployed. This is not a black eye for baseball. It is a ruptured spleen, a punctured lung and a lacerated kidney.
What a failure, this offseason. No matter how much Bryce Harper and Manny Machado ultimately sign for, no matter where they end up, this is now more than three months of posturing and feinting, star-shooting and lowballing. This winter was supposed to be all fireworks. Instead, it is a sparkler.
Nobody is happy with this. Fans are rightfully tired of waiting and guessing. Intrigue has evolved into annoyance. Players are clearly dubious about the market -- and the league's intentions. MLB is understandably embarrassed that two of its best players are preparing for an unfortunate uniform swap -- baseball jersey and pants for pajamas -- as they entertain the possibility of missing the beginning of spring training.
While not considered a particularly strong fit, executives from the Giants met with free-agent outfielder Bryce Harper on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, league sources told ESPN.
As MLB's two biggest free-agent names remain unclaimed, there are signs clubs can afford to wait them out for a more team-friendly deal.
Small-market teams aren't watching rich teams sign all the top free agents anymore. They're watching rich teams sign all the top free agents -- at discounts.
This cannot continue -- not unless MLB and the MLB Players Association are so intransigent in their positions that they'll stop feeding coal to their mutually beneficial gravy train simply to make a point. It's why the unusual step of wide-ranging talks in the middle of a collective bargaining agreement, which started Jan. 14 with the league and continued via counterproposal Friday by the players, was so welcome.
The sides, it turns out, can work together, and among the laundry list of items discussed, the ratification of new rules would go a long way toward fortifying a relationship in great need of repair. There will be a 20-second pitch clock in 2019 -- and rather than force commissioner Rob Manfred to unilaterally implement it, as is his right, the union should seek reasonable concessions, such as the expansion of the regular-season roster to 26 players along with the league's request for a contraction of out-of-control September rosters.
Do that, and then tentatively approve for implementation in 2020 the league's wish of a three-batter minimum for pitchers and the union's for all 30 teams to use the designated hitter. Make a deal. Set an example. Thaw the palpable dissent. Then promise to return to the bargaining table soon thereafter and address an issue for which everyone is responsible.
Free agency, once the raison d'etre of the MLBPA, once the fulcrum of MLB's offseason, is broken. And though nobody on either side likes to use that word, the argument is merely semantic. Broken doesn't mean beyond repair. It means that something bad happened, and it has. Where everything goes sideways is the immediacy with which each side blames the other. It's poisonous. MLB says players are being unrealistic. Players believe owners are being tight-fisted. They snipe and blame and lament, and all the while, on the side of the road, sits economic peace, mangled as if struck by an 18-wheeler.
This is not to say bargaining will be easy. It won't. And yet after consecutive winters in which the biggest free agents waited months to sign, it matters less who's responsible and more who's willing to solve the problem. Which is saying a lot, because that responsibility is central to this story. The union failed to see the consequences of the deal it negotiated playing out in such dystopian fashion for players. MLB has fostered an environment in which its defining ideology -- urgency -- has been replaced by a corporatized fealty to efficiency.
Everybody is to blame. Together, MLB and the union are the shepherds of the sport, and they have guided it to a dangerous place, in which the players already are banking marketing money in anticipation of a work stoppage -- one, it should be noted, that is wholly unnecessary considering the current collective bargaining agreement runs for nearly three more years.
It could be nothing more than most posturing, though it reflects the combative position players are preparing to adopt. They're frustrated. They see revenues increasing. They fear salaries, for the second consecutive year, are decreasing. They cringe at the noncompetitive behavior, with union calculations showing that 18 teams are carrying payrolls at least $50 million under the $206 million luxury-tax threshold, 14 teams are $75 million-plus under, and eight teams are more than $100 million under.
The league cannot mandate that any of its 30 teams spend. It understands what every team -- and, truth be told, the smart players -- understands: that after years of an irrational free-agent market in which they paid players in their 30s for performance in their 20s, teams are keen to end that folly. They increasingly rely upon analytical evaluations of players. Those calculations, though not infallible, are rooted in math, logic and history. In a vacuum, the numbers alone make a compelling case.
He's 37 and throwing 99. Baseball's best comeback story will be playing out during spring training. Jeff Passan »
Free agency, of course, does not exist in a vacuum. So many minuscule elements lead to the ripe market players such as Harper and Machado warrant. Their free agency is confusing, particularly in a system teeming with riches. They want to be in spring training, meeting their new teammates, getting ready for the season. They also don't want to agree to a deal for less than what they believe their market should be.
This is the tricky part. What should their market be? The union has, since its infancy, espoused free-market principles -- a trust that as long as free agency was really free, teams would prioritize winning enough to create bidding wars and drive up prices in that pursuit. The theory is reasonable. It did work for 40 years.
Over the past two winters, it hasn't. And though it may seem reactionary to want levers that juice the market until the sides can make wholesale changes, it would serve a mutually beneficial purpose. Players would be happy. Teams, most of which operate as monetary printing presses, wouldn't risk the consequences of a work stoppage hindering a strong business, particularly when the underpinnings of that strong business are threatened by decreased attendance, decreased national relevance and a dearth of new, young fans. The best long-term solution -- a half-dozen people spanning the league, union, player and agent communities agreed -- is a proper distribution of money, with more going to the youngest and most productive players, like, you know, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado, who both happen to be 26 years old.
That may be the craziest part of all this winter: Harper and Machado were supposed to be the ones. The winter meetings in Las Vegas were supposed to kick off a festival of activity. There was supposed to be clarity, which would lead to excitement heading into spring training. Well, spring training is nigh, what was supposed to happen didn't and while conversation about Harper and Machado continues to percolate on TV, from the radio and at barstools, it's laced with aggravation and negative connotations -- none of the things you want associated with your product. This free-agent period is near its end, with only 30 or so players left who look like they'll get major league deals and another 70-plus coming to the realization that they'll soon be signing a non-guaranteed minor league deal.
Which talented stars of tomorrow found a home on this year's list?
• Individual players: Just Missed | Top 100: 100-51  | 50-1 | Impact 20
• Team rankings: Ranking all 30 farm systems | AL East | AL Central | AL West | NL East | NL Central | NL West
That disintegration of the market led to the biggest news Wednesday: Harper had met the day before in Las Vegas with a cohort of representatives from the San Francisco Giants, a wildly successful, wildly rich baseball team with upward of $500 million in annual revenues. This meeting did not take place on the first or 10th or even 50th day of free agency, because it didn't have to. The Giants, wary of Harper's actual market, figured they could wait. So they waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and waited nearly three months more until going to Vegas for an awfully high return-on-investment trip. Maybe Harper would fall in love with the idea of the Giants. Maybe he would budge on his price -- even if the only sense of that price is the reported 10-year, $300 million deal Harper turned down from the Washington Nationals in September.
The Giants' tack simply is the norm now. In the NBA and NFL, free agency is a free-for-all. In baseball, it puts the ""free"" in freezing. And that is good for no one, least of all the fans, who are bound to tune in for Day 98, 99, 100, see no change in status and light a sparkler in honor of a broken winter.

25989900,"Kapler told reporters that Arrieta had the surgery, which the manager described as ""a meniscus cleanup,"" after injuring his left knee while weight training.
""There were no structural issues,"" Kapler told reporters, according to Philly.com.
Aaron Nola, who won a career-best 17 games and had a 2.37 ERA last season, has agreed to a four-year, $45 million extension with the Phillies that includes a club option for a fifth season.
The manager said Arrieta is ""right on track"" to be ready for the start of the regular season or shortly afterward.
""We may slow several guys down, and we might not come out with our five-man rotation at the start. But it's not going to be due to injury. It's going to be our progression plan,"" Kapler said, according to Philly.com.
Arrieta, who will turn 33 on March 6, finished 10-11 with a 3.96 ERA last season, his first with the Phillies after signing a three-year, $75 million contract. He wasn't ready for the start of last season because he didn't sign with the team until March 12.

25990241,"Leave it to Alex Bregman to try and stir up a little controversy.
The All-Star third baseman for the Houston Astros had a breakout season at the plate in 2018, hitting 31 home runs and finishing fifth in the American League MVP voting, while also having a breakout season on social media. He's one of the few stars in baseball who seems to want the spotlight on him and now he's stirring things up a bit with the Boston Red Sox, the team that eliminated the Astros in the ALCS.
""After watching the Patriots win and with the Red Sox beating us last year, there's no other city that I would like to beat more this year than Boston,"" he said recently on the ""Going Deep with Chad and JT"" podcast featuring Chad Kroeger and JT Parr.
OK, that's hardly NBA-level smack talk, but it's bold enough in baseball circles to make the rounds and Red Sox manager Alex Cora was asked about it on Wednesday. He laughed.
""That's my guy, so I'm not going to react to that one,"" Cora said.
So much for this blowing up into a big soap opera.
Cora and Bregman became close when Cora served as the Astros' bench coach in 2017. Last September, the two made a little wager when Cora's University of Miami Hurricanes played Bregman's LSU Tigers in football. If LSU won, Cora would have to wear a jersey of LSU baseball legend Warren Morris. If Miami won, Bregman would have to wear a The U turnover chain in batting practice at Fenway Park. LSU won the game and Cora had to wear the Morris jersey.
Just spoke w Warren Morris, who got a texted photo from a friend & enjoyed seeing Alex Cora wearing his #LSU number 4.""I know it pained him to put on that gold jersey, but it looked good on him,"" Warren said. ""It's all in good fun.""⁦@LSUbaseball⁩ ⁦⁦@ABREG_1⁩ pic.twitter.com/KdEmIgEQUf
Still, maybe there's hope for an Astros-Red Sox rivalry to take off and get some real heat going. Don't forget that during the ALCS, Bregman posted a video on Instagram of the Astros hitting back-to-back-to-back home runs off Nathan Eovaldi from earlier in the season, when Eovaldi was with the Rays. Bregman took the video down, and Eovaldi allowed two runs in six innings in his start in Game 3, an 8-2 Red Sox victory.
""We do our talking on the field,"" Red Sox first baseman Steve Pearce said after the game.
Beyond that, the teams have met in the postseason the past two years, they're the past two World Series champs, and last year's ALCS also featured the sign-stealing controversy when an Astros employee was spotted in the camera well at Fenway Park, reportedly aiming a camera into the Red Sox dugout. Cleveland.com also reported that during the ALDS, the Indians filed a complaint with MLB about the Astros trying to film their dugout.
Although MLB eventually cleared the Astros of the sign-stealing allegations, Red Sox president Dave Dombrowski wasn't happy with Houston general manager Jeff Luhnow's explanation that the Astros were merely being proactive in policing other ballparks for ""suspicious activity.""
""I don't like the implication that we were doing something that they were checking on when they were actually ... the ones who created a false credential, or asked for a credential, of somebody that's not supposed to have one,"" Dombrowski said at the time.
In 2017, MLB fined the Red Sox for illegally using an Apple watch in the dugout to relay signs in a game against the Yankees.
Bottom line: Mark your calendars for May 17, Astros at Red Sox for their first meeting of 2019.

He was acquired by the Reds on Dec. 21 along with outfielders Yasiel Puig and Matt Kemp.

He didn't pitch for the Tigers between July 14 and Aug. 24 because of a left oblique strain, then didn't pitch after Sept. 15 because of a torn right lateral meniscus.

I went out on the limb with Javier Baez and he finished second in the MVP voting. I also had Eric Hosmer returning to the Royals and winning the fan vote as the AL starter.
Oops.
Remember the rules: 32-man rosters (20 position players, 12 pitchers) and at least one rep for each team. The projected starters are in bold. And don't forget to factor in Harper and Machado ...
Yadier Molina, Cardinals; J.T. Realmuto, Reds; Willson Contreras, Cubs
Molina, a nine-time All-Star, hasn't started the All-Star Game since 2013 but gets voted back in this season. He's now 36 but continues to show remarkable durability and is coming off a 20-homer, Gold Glove season. Note that I have Realmuto with the Reds rather than Marlins, as those trade rumors have picked up a lot of steam in recent days.
Notably absent: six-time All-Star Buster Posey, who has started three of the past four All-Star Games for the NL (Contreras started last year). Posey had season-ending hip surgery in late August to repair a torn labrum and infringement. Doctors also discovered a microfracture during the surgery. The injuries reportedly prevented Posey from firing his hips as he swung, so the hope is that he returns healthy and with more power.
Anyone else ready for this offseason to end? Well, good news, baseball fans: Pitchers and catchers report in seven days!
From washed-up stars to guys who've never lived up to their paychecks and one slugger who is out of baseball, we examine MLB's biggest money mistakes.
From the superteams to the surprises that surged into October, history tells us somebody won't make it back. We examine who will be left out.
Paul Goldschmidt, Cardinals; Anthony Rizzo, Cubs; Freddie Freeman, Braves
Goldschmidt recovered from a slow start to finish sixth in the MVP voting and should once again be an MVP candidate on his new team. Rizzo also got off to a wretched start, hitting .149 with one home run in April before hitting .329 in the second half. Steady Freddie has averaged 5.7 WAR the past three seasons.
Beyond those three, National League first base is so deep that you could comfortably list nine or 10 guys over the best first baseman in the American League. I left off Joey Votto, who led the NL with a .417 OBP but hit just 12 home runs. Rhys Hoskins moves back to his natural position and I expect him to improve on his .246/.354/496, 34-homer sophomore campaign. Heck, Daniel Murphy, now with the Rockies, could hit .350 and win the batting title and rank as the ninth- or 10th-best player at the position depending on how you feel about Max Muncy, Jesus Aguilar, Brandon Belt or even Mets rookie Peter Alonso.
Robinson Cano, Mets; Ozzie Albies, Braves
The widely ignored facet of the Mets-Mariners trade: Cano can still play, hitting .303/.374/.471 with Seattle. It's not a deep group at second base, so he has a chance to earn his first starting gig since 2014 (he was also an All-Star in 2016 and 2017). Albies burst out of the gate last season and finished with an impressive 69 extra-base hits as a 21-year-old. Pitchers figured him out in the second half, however, as he tailed off to .226/.282/.342, so he'll need to better balance his aggressive approach with a little better pitch selection to return to the All-Star Game.
Nolan Arenado, Rockies; Manny Machado, Phillies; Josh Donaldson, Braves
This is the most loaded position in the majors -- and that's even before predicting that Machado lands with the Phillies. Arenado has started the past two All-Star Games, Machado should enjoy a fifth straight 30-homer season if he lands in Philly and I like Donaldson coming out strong and signing a long-term extension with the Braves in June. Other candidates include Kris Bryant (coming off a shoulder injury), Anthony Rendon (who somehow has never been an All-Star), Eugenio Suarez (an All-Star last season), Matt Carpenter (moving back to third on a full-time basis), Justin Turner (who only leads the NL in wRC+ over the past two seasons) and Travis Shaw (63 home runs the past two seasons).
Javier Baez, Cubs; Trevor Story, Rockies
Baez will start out at shortstop while Addison Russell serves a 40-game suspension for violating MLB's domestic violence policy but could move back to second once Russell returns. We'll slot Baez at shortstop and make him an All-Star, although it will be interesting to see if he can repeat the .290/.326/.554 line that helped place him second in the MVP voting. He's a unique player: It's basically impossible to put up that line with 167 strikeouts and just 29 walks, but Baez makes it work with amazing bat speed. Imagine what he could do with a little better discipline, considering he hit .189 on pitches outside the zone (and swung 44 percent of the time on pitches out of the zone).
Story reduced his strikeout rate from 34.4 percent to 25.6 percent and his numbers shot up across the board, as he led the NL with 85 extra-base hits and produced 5.6 WAR. He adds value on the bases, is a solid defender and gets the nod here over Corey Seager (coming off Tommy John surgery), burner Trea Turner, Brandon Crawford (last year's starter) and Jean Segura, who joins the Phillies after an All-Star season with Seattle.
Bryce Harper, Padres; Christian Yelich, Brewers; Ronald Acuña Jr., Braves; Juan Soto, Nationals; Cody Bellinger, Dodgers; Yasiel Puig, Reds; Brian Anderson, Marlins
Last year's NL outfield starters included Matt Kemp and Nick Markakis. No offense to those two fine veterans, but I like the younger star power to take over this season. First, one likely holdover, albeit in a new uniform: That's right, Harper to the Padres is going to happen and he makes my way-too-early squad as the lone San Diego representative. He'll be joined by 2018 MVP winner Yelich, who will prove his monster second half was no fluke, and super soph sensation Acuña, who hit .322/.403/.625 in the second half. Can you say 2019 MVP?
Then again ... maybe the 2019 MVP will be Soto, a hitting savant who produced a .923 OPS as a 19-year-old rookie. Yes, he's that good. I like Bellinger to bounce back after his numbers dipped a bit from his rookie season. With Muncy at first base, look for Bellinger to get a lot more time in the outfield. As he showed in the playoffs, he's a plus defender in center, although he might move to right field to clear room for A.J. Pollock. I can see Puig either sinking or shining in Cincinnati. For some reason, he has struggled against lefties the past two seasons. If he can improve in that area, he can return to his first All-Star Game since 2014. Anderson had a solid rookie season and makes our squad as the Marlins' rep.
He's 37 and throwing 99. Baseball's best comeback story will be playing out during spring training. Jeff Passan »
Jacob deGrom, Mets; Max Scherzer, Nationals; Aaron Nola, Phillies; Walker Buehler, Dodgers; Jameson Taillon, Pirates; German Marquez, Rockies; Robbie Ray, Diamondbacks; Madison Bumgarner, Giants
None of the first four names should be a surprise, as the first three went 1-2-3 in the Cy Young voting. The fourth name isn't Clayton Kershaw (who missed the All-Star Game last season for the first time since 2010) but teammate Buehler, a rising star who went 8-5 with a 2.62 ERA as a rookie. You saw his electric stuff and deep arsenal of pitches in the postseason, and his .193 average allowed ranked fourth best in the majors among pitchers with at least 100 innings.
Taillon had an under-the-radar season with the Pirates, going 14-10 with a 3.20 ERA over 191 innings, including a 2.33 ERA in the second half as he continued to improve his command and strikeout-to-walk ratio. With Taillon, Trevor Williams and full seasons from Chris Archer and Joe Musgrove, the Pirates have a chance to surprise (albeit in a tough division). Kyle Freeland had the big season for the Rockies in 2018, but I like Marquez as their ace in 2019 after a season in which he had 230 strikeouts in 196 innings. He was as good as any pitcher in the second half thanks to an improved curveball to add to his fastball/wipeout slider combo.
Ray was an All-Star in 2017 and I predicted big things for him in 2018. It didn't happen, but I'm predicting big things again in 2019. Maybe it will happen this time! Bumgarner is still on the Giants and we need a Giants rep, although I don't know if he'll still be with them after the All-Star break.
Edwin Diaz, Mets; Josh Hader, Brewers; Felipe Vazquez, Pirates; Sean Doolittle, Nationals
All I have to say: Good luck against the bullpen. The notable missing name is Kenley Jansen, an All-Star the past three seasons. He's supposed to be fine after offseason heart surgery, but the 13 home runs he allowed in 71 2/3 innings -- and two more big ones in the World Series -- are of concern.
Salvador Perez, Royals; Gary Sanchez, Yankees
So here's a big problem in selecting the AL team compared to the NL: You get 20 position players, but since the AL selects two designated hitters, they have just two ""free"" spots remaining compared to four for the NL. Throw in the mandatory requirement of one player per team and sometimes those two free spots get spoken for, so players at a loaded position have a harder time making it. Then if you select three catchers, as is usually the case, the roster is even more crowded.
My solution: two catchers! Perez has started the past five All-Star Games -- and that, to be honest, is more an indictment of the AL catching crop for half a decade now than a stamp on Perez's own greatness. I mean, he hasn't had an OBP above .300 since 2013. In fact, only 14 players have batted at least 499 times in a season and had more seasons with an OBP under .300 (including longtime Royals teammate Alcides Escobar, who has had seven). Perez is going for his sixth in a row.
Jose Abreu, White Sox; Matt Olson, A's
If the AL catching situation isn't bleak enough for you, we turn to first base. The All-Stars last season were Abreu and Mitch Moreland. The year before, Justin Smoak and Yonder Alonso. Can we import a couple of guys from the NL for the game?
Jose Altuve, Astros; Whit Merrifield, Royals
Altuve is already a six-time All-Star and looks like an easy call to start for the fifth straight time. Despite playing through a knee issue last season, he hit .316/.386/.451 (but just .276 in the second half). Look for a rebound in his numbers. Merrifield is one of the more surprising success stories in recent seasons, developing into a terrific all-around player who led AL second basemen in WAR in 2018. His competition for backup has thinned, as Cano, Jed Lowrie and Brian Dozier all switched leagues.
Alex Bregman, Astros; Jose Ramirez, Indians; Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Blue Jays
It's a tough call leaving Oakland's Matt Chapman off the team, but Bregman's emerging status as one of the faces of the game makes him a potential starter with Ramirez -- third in the MVP voting each of the past two seasons -- a solid bet to make his third straight team. Chapman is a defensive whiz and I'm buying the improvement at the plate, but he gets squeezed by wunderkind Vladdy Jr., who will get called up a week into the season and won't stop hitting for the next 15 years. He makes it as the Blue Jays' lone rep and as one of the biggest stories of the first half.
Francisco Lindor, Indians; Carlos Correa, Astros
Which talented stars of tomorrow found a home on this year's list?
• Individual players: Just Missed | Top 100: 100-51  | 50-1 | Impact 20
• Team rankings: Ranking all 30 farm systems | AL East | AL Central | AL West | NL East | NL Central | NL West
Can Lindor take yet another step forward? I think it's possible. His OPS has gone from .794 to .842 to .871 but there was a glaring hole in his record: He feasted on bad pitching and struggled against good pitching. Against sub-.500 opponents (like the rest of his division), he hit .302/.375/.579 with 31 home runs in 104 games. Against winning teams, he hit .226/.303/.396 with seven home runs in 54 games.
Correa had a disappointing, injury-riddled season as his OPS fell more than 200 points. Let's hope for a healthy season and the resulting big numbers that will make him an All-Star over Andrelton Simmons, Xander Bogaerts and Gleyber Torres, who I expect to get more action at shortstop for the Yankees than Troy Tulowitzki.
Mike Trout, Angels; Mookie Betts, Red Sox; Aaron Judge, Yankees; Mitch Haniger, Mariners; Andrew Benintendi, Red Sox; Tommy Pham, Rays; Nicholas Castellanos, Tigers
I'll take the first three to repeat as the starting trio. Nothing too controversial in those selections. If you want a non-Trout, non-Betts choice for MVP, don't sleep on Judge, who was hitting .285/.398/.548 when he went down on July 26 and didn't return until mid-September. (How scary will the Yankees be if Judge, Sanchez and Giancarlo Stanton all produce closer to their 2017 numbers than 2018?)
Haniger is the only Mariner here, but he makes it on merit after hitting .286/.366/.493 with 26 home runs and good defense in 2018. He made the All-Star team last year and is capable of another 6.1-WAR season. There's a reason Jerry Dipoto held on to Haniger during his offseason dumping frenzy. Benintendi is never going to be a big home run masher, but I forecast better than a .290 average and 16 home runs, especially if he can improve against lefties. Pham is a personal favorite. He started red-hot in April with the Cardinals, fell into a deep slump (under .200 in May and June) that led to his exile from St. Louis, and then tore it up in 39 games for the Rays (.343/.448/.622).
Quick, can you name the Tigers' All-Star rep last year? No, you can't. It was middle reliever Joe Jimenez, who finished with a 4.31 ERA. A dramatic comeback from Miguel Cabrera would be nice, but we'll go with the hard-hitting Castellanos as this year's rep.
J.D. Martinez, Red Sox; Giancarlo Stanton, Yankees
Nelson Cruz is a possibility here and Shin-Soo Choo was an All-Star last season. Then we have Shohei Ohtani, who will DH exclusively this year but won't be ready for Opening Day (although the Angels haven't otherwise given a timetable for his return). Oh, and don't forget Khris Davis: All he has done is hit the most home runs in the majors over the past three seasons with 133 -- nine more than Stanton and 14 more than Cruz.
Trevor Bauer, Indians; Gerrit Cole, Astros; Justin Verlander, Astros; Corey Kluber, Indians; Blake Snell, Rays; James Paxton, Yankees; Jose Berrios, Twins; Josh James, Astros
Let's start off with the glaring omission: Chris Sale, who has started the past three All-Star Games, which is pretty awesome (Lefty Gomez and Robin Roberts are the only others to start three in a row). Sale was obviously not 100 percent down the stretch and in the postseason last season after missing time in August and September with a sore shoulder. It seems likely that the Red Sox will ramp him up slowly this spring and limit his innings as much as possible early in the season.
Even without Sale, the AL is loaded with starting pitching depth. The first five were All-Stars last season and joined Sale as the top six vote-getters in the Cy Young voting. Snell was the winner over Verlander after going 21-5 with a 1.89 ERA, with the only knock against him is that he clocked just 180 2/3 innings. He's unlikely to repeat one of the most insane stats of 2018: Batters hit .088 against him (10-for-114) with runners in scoring position. OK, so maybe that means he won't post a sub-2.00 ERA again, but he's the real deal.
Paxton makes it over teammate Luis Severino, who struggled in the second half after pitching like a Cy Young winner in the first half. Berrios returns as the Twins' rep, as he was in 2018. Then my big shocker: Astros rookie James, who came out of nowhere to have a dominant minor league season with his upper-90s heat (that hit 100 when he pitched out of the bullpen in the majors). He's not even guaranteed a job in the rotation, but I think he wins it (and rookie All-Star starters aren't an anomaly). Since 2011, we've had Michael Pineda, Lance Lynn, Wade Miley, Yu Darvish, Jose Fernandez and Masahiro Tanaka.
Blake Treinen, A's; Jose Leclerc, Rangers; Adam Ottavino, Yankees; Mychal Givens, Orioles
It's hard to leave off Treinen after he crushed opponents last year with 100 K's in 80 1/3 innings, just two home runs allowed and a 0.78 ERA. Leclerc quietly was one of the best relievers in the majors last season, holding batters to a .126 average -- tied with Craig Kimbrel's 2012 for the second-lowest mark ever for a pitcher (minimum 50 innings), behind only Aroldis Chapman's .121 mark in 2014.
Speaking of Chapman, he still could make it again. So could Dellin Betances, Zach Britton or Chad Green. I went with Ottavino because a guy who can dominate hitters in Colorado could be unhittable at sea level. And, saving the best for last, we have to pick somebody from the Orioles. Givens has been a workhorse the past three seasons for Baltimore and should take over as the closer ... although those save opportunities are likely to be few and far between.

25954392,"Zaidi would not say whether an offer was extended to the star outfielder. The Giants still hope to add two outfielders.
A fan posted that he spotted Giants CEO Larry Baer in the Bellagio on Monday night.
In dealing for baseball's best catcher, Philadelphia boosted its NL East chances while keeping the possibility of an even bigger move on the table.
The Braves' system is still loaded, the Nats are deeper than you might think, the Mets and Phillies have dealt a lot of talent and the Marlins ... are the Marlins.
""It's kind of hard to deny when your CEO gets made in the casino,"" Zaidi said with a chuckle Friday. ""There's obviously mutual interest on both sides, so we thought it made sense to get together. We had a good conversation over a few hours, and he's obviously got a lot of suitors and a lot of interest. He's going to have some decisions to make, but again, I think it's fair to say that was an expression of our interest level to make the trip out there and meet with him.""
Zaidi said background discussions led to the meeting: ""We didn't just show up at his doorstep.""
""Having kind of a face-to-face meeting gives you kind of a different level of being able to engage,"" Zaidi said. ""Can't exactly deny that the meeting happened. But beyond that, not really going to have comment on the substance of the meeting beyond that obviously we have interest. You don't make a trip out there to meet with a player just for show.""
While cautioning that he is not familiar with negotiations, commissioner Rob Manfred is eager to see some of the game's big names with teams for spring training.
""We want players signed, particularly star players,"" Manfred said. ""I wish they were signed and ready to go. We got another week before they have to report. I'm really hopeful that it's going to get resolved during that period of time. But obviously we want our star players signed and ready to go when we start playing.""
Also Friday, Zaidi confirmed that the Giants agreed to a minor league contract with 35-year-old catcher Rene Rivera. San Francisco wants to add depth behind Buster Posey, who is healthy following season-ending right hip surgery in late August. Rivera batted .233 with four homers and 11 RBIs in 33 games between the Angels and Braves last season. If added to the 40-man roster, he would get a one-year contract paying $1.3 million in the majors and would have the chance to earn additional performance bonuses.
Posey, for one, is ready to play with Harper if the Giants can somehow pull off acquiring him.
""Yeah, sign him up!"" Posey said. ""What team out there wouldn't want a Bryce Harper, a Manny Machado or a lot of free agents out there? I think as players, that's what we, from the time you're 5 years old, you aspire to play against the best competition, whether it's in your Little League game or your high school, college, the big league level. As a fan myself and fans that come to the game or watch it on TV, when the Giants are playing X, Y and Z, fans [want] to say, 'We're going to get the best competition. We know that we're going to get to see a great game tonight.""

25935056,"Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association are discussing potentially drastic changes to the on-field game and economic landscape of the sport in the middle of a collective bargaining agreement, a significant departure from the past that speaks to the chasm between the parties but represents a thaw in the chill that has divided the sides, sources familiar with the talks told ESPN.
Dueling proposals from MLB on Jan. 14 and the union on Friday covered a wide range of topics, according to sources. Among them include:
A three-batter minimum for pitchers
A universal designated hitter
A single trade deadline before the All-Star break
A 20-second pitch clock
The expansion of rosters to 26 men, with a 12-pitcher maximum
Draft advantages for winning teams and penalties for losing teams
A study to lower the mound
A rule that would allow two-sport amateurs to sign major league contracts
With owners meetings set to begin this week and spring training next week amid another tepid free-agent market, the willingness to bandy about ideas -- and the openness to addressing concerns -- is seen as a step in the right direction by both sides. Whether any substantive change comes of it, sources said, remains unclear.
The three-batter minimum for pitchers, first reported by The Athletic, is perhaps the most controversial measure, as it would ostensibly eliminate a job created by modern bullpen use: the one-out left-handed reliever. MLB's proposal of the idea illustrates the league's concern with both time and pace of game, as constant bullpen shuffling has contributed to the average game time lasting longer than three hours. The rule would apply to all pitchers, except in instances in which pitchers finish an inning or are injured, sources said.
We're still waiting for this winter's big free agents to sign, but that didn't stop us from predicting which uniforms they'll be wearing in the Midsummer Classic. Who else makes our star-studded squads?
Days before spring training begins, the offseason's marquee name is adding suitors instead of making his way to camp with a new team. Here's what MLB must do to repair its busted hot stove.
If -- and when -- the National League adopts the designated hitter, these dominoes will fall.
The union did not strongly oppose the idea, according to sources, instead suggesting it preferred the implementation to be delayed until 2020 rather than 2019, as MLB proposed.
The league's other bid to deal with pace of play was the enactment of a 20-second pitch clock, something commissioner Rob Manfred can put into place unilaterally. While numerous players have spoken out against the pitch clock, the recognition that Manfred has the ability to mandate it, even without the union's support, gives him leverage on the issue, according to sources.
In the discussions, the possibility of the clock being turned off when runners are on base was raised, sources said.
One of the union's counterproposals was the adoption of the designated hitter in the National League, according to sources. While a compromise could be the rule being eased in, the union is advocating for a universal DH in 2019, sources said.
In addition to the universal DH, the MLBPA is interested in changes that would use draft picks to incentivize winning and grant players the ability to earn additional service, which could allow them to hit free agency earlier and theoretically counteract what the union believes is the manipulation of service time by teams.
Low-revenue teams that succeed -- whether by finishing above .500 or making the playoffs -- would be given greater draft positions or bonus pools under the union's proposal, according to sources. While the depth of the penalties were not clear, the union suggested teams that lose 90-plus games in consecutive years could be affected negatively in the draft.
In the wake of Oakland Athletics first-round pick Kyler Murray potentially leaving behind baseball to pursue an NFL career after a Heisman Trophy-winning season, the union also suggested the idea of bringing back the major league contract as an enticement for two-sport athletes to stick with baseball, sources said. Currently, all draft contracts are minor league deals subject to a draft pool that penalizes teams that exceed it.
Service-time issues remain a key concern for the union, according to sources, with teams capable of keeping major league-ready players in the minor leagues without recourse. While both sides acknowledge service time is a difficult problem to solve, the union's proposal included the possibility of additional service time for performance, playoff appearances or awards, according to sources.
Among the union's ideas was a single trade deadline before the All-Star break, sources said. Currently, the non-waiver trade deadline is July 31, and players who pass through waivers can be dealt until Aug. 31. An earlier trade deadline could force teams to emphasize the first half, which might force them to focus more in the offseason on acquiring players via free agency to improve the likelihood of that rather than allowing them to strike well past the 100-game mark.
MLB's carrot in its proposal was an expansion of roster size from 25 to 26, creating 30 new major league jobs, according to sources. The offering included a 28-man limit on September rosters and a maximum of 12 pitchers during non-September games, sources said.
The league also is interested in studying mound height, with the potential for Manfred to implement a lowering of the mound in 2020, according to sources.
Another league proposal would end all spring training games that are tied after 10 innings and use spring training and the All-Star Game as testing grounds for the rule that starts a runner on second base in the 10th inning of a tied game.
In typical bargaining sessions, dozens of ideas are offered, considered and placed on the back burner, so the likelihood of a handful of these proposals being ratified, let alone all of them, is unlikely, according to sources. Still, as MLB and the union seek to find a place of understanding amid a winter chill that has fractured already-tenuous relations, the mere discussion, sources said, is considered a positive.

25940699,"If added to the 40-man roster, Tazawa would receive a one-year contract paying $800,000 while in the major leagues. He could earn $450,000 in performance bonuses for games pitched and $750,000 for games finished.
The 32-year-old right-hander was 1-1 with a 7.07 ERA in 31 games last season for Miami and the Los Angeles Angels. He was released by Miami on May 21, signed a minor league deal with Detroit on June 3, was released July 9 after seven games with Triple-A Toledo and signed with the Angels four days later.
Tazawa is 21-26 with a 4.12 ERA in nine big league seasons that began with Boston (2009-16) before he joined the Marlins in 2017.
He would get $50,000 each for 40 and 45 games, $75,000 apiece for 50 and 55 and $100,000 each for 60 and 65. He would get $75,000 each for 40 and 45 games finished, $100,000 for 50, $200,000 for 55 and $300,000 for 60.
Chicago also announced minor league deals Wednesday with right-handers George Kontos, Christian Bergman, Carlos Ramirez, Colin Rea and Rob Scahill; left-hander Mike Zagurski; catcher Francisco Arcia; infielders Cristhian Adames and Phillip Evans; and outfielders Jim Adduci and Evan Marzilli.

25999397,"Farquhar, who turns 32 on Sunday, collapsed in the dugout after coming off the mound in a game against the Astros. He was taken to a Chicago hospital and underwent surgery.
Farquhar, signed to a minor league contract two weeks ago, is using a 6-ounce product from Unequal Technologies that is fitted for the official Major League Baseball 4-ounce New Era Cap, Unequal CEO Rob Vito told OTL.
""The Yankees contacted us to design something to meet with the approval of his neurologist,"" said Vito. ""What we made protects his temple and the skull area where he had surgery.""
Vito said the ""Uncap"" consists of a Kevlar composite insert and an outer flap of a polymer similar to what is used in batting helmets.
The insert, said Vito, is secured inside the cap's sweatband to avoid having it shift with the motion of the pitcher.
MLB permits pitchers to use any type of protective headwear, as long as it doesn't interfere with play or with licensing agreements.
Farquhar has pitched 253 big league games -- all in relief -- since debuting in the majors with Toronto in 2011.

25989310,"That's about as close to throwing as the Japanese two-way star is right now.
Ohtani wouldn't change how he handled his elbow injury late last year, continuing to hit for the Angels until season's end even if it meant delaying reconstructive surgery and his ability to pitch again until 2020.
""I have no regrets about what happened last year. That's what the team thought about me, the plan,"" Ohtani said through an interpreter. ""In the end it didn't work out but I still have no regrets.""
The Astros have managed to keep their talent pipeline strong, with the Angels, A's, Mariners and Rangers struggling to hang with them.
The reigning AL Rookie of the Year is recovering from an Oct. 1 Tommy John surgery with the hope he will be able to bat in the Los Angeles lineup as early as May if all stays on schedule.
""There's a lot of variables. That's the goal I'm shooting for but there might be some setbacks here and there,"" Ohtani said. ""If not, that's what I'm trying to go for.""
At Tempe Diablo Stadium, the scene Wednesday was a far cry from a year ago when Ohtani showed up at spring training with fanfare and faced a huge media contingent following his every move. For now, the two-way star isn't even on the field as he works out inside.
Even the second time around, ""I feel just as nervous as last year, my first year.""
Ohtani acknowledged that's partly because he's behind schedule with the extensive rehab and will have to ""catch up to everybody.""
""It's going to be a slow process,"" new manager Brad Ausmus said ahead of his club's first on-field session for pitchers and catchers. ""He gets his workouts in. Right now he'll be mostly inside. We need to protect this guy long term, so we're hoping for May. But if it goes longer, it goes longer.""
The 24-year-old Ohtani spent time back home in Japan this offseason working through his rehabilitation, which right now includes dry swings only in terms of his hitting preparation.
Ohtani said everything is going smoothly at this stage.
""So far there's nothing in my elbow, I don't feel anything there. It's been great,"" he said. ""I just need to watch my effort level, try to keep it down and listen to the trainers.""
Ohtani went 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA in 10 starts as a pitcher. He played 104 games overall as a rookie, hitting .285 with 22 homers and 61 RBIs.
While the Angels can't wait to get Ohtani healthy to hit, they won't rush him. He and Albert Pujols are expected to share designated hitter duties, with Pujols playing first on days Ohtani hits -- that is, if Pujols is physically fine and performing, otherwise Justin Bour becomes an option. The free agent first baseman signed a $2.5 million, one-year deal in December.
""That's why we're saying we're going to be extremely cautious because we don't want the fact that he might be able to DH affect him being able to pitch in 2020,"" Ausmus said of Ohtani.
Ohtani has accepted this year will be about what he can do behind the plate.
""This season I'm obviously going to be prioritizing my hitting. That's what I'm going to focus on right now,"" he said. ""We can push back the pitching because I'm not going to be pitching this season. So the plan is to get back hitting first and take it easy on the pitching side.""

25990437,"TEMPE, Ariz. -- There was a time, not long ago, when Matt Harvey was the premier pitcher in all of baseball, headlining a young Mets rotation that also featured Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard.
But his career got sidetracked, mostly because of self-inflicted wounds.
""I'm disappointed in myself,"" Harvey told reporters in a harsh assessment Wednesday after the Los Angeles Angels' first official workout of spring training.
Harvey posted a 6.00 ERA in four starts for the Mets last season and was demoted to the bullpen. The right-hander was traded to Cincinnati after refusing a minor league assignment.
AL Rookie of the Year Shohei Ohtani, who is recovering from Tommy John surgery, hopes he'll be able to bat in the Angels' lineup as early as May if all stays on schedule.
The Astros have managed to keep their talent pipeline strong, with the Angels, A's, Mariners and Rangers struggling to hang with them.
His troubles weren't limited to the field, however. In 2017, he was suspended three games for not showing up at the park for a Saturday game after partying on Friday night and playing golf in the morning. Four days before the Mets cut ties with Harvey, he was spotted partying in Beverly Hills the night before pitching against San Diego.
""I wouldn't say I'm happy for the experiences I've gone through, but I think for the rest of my career it'll better me as a teammate and a player,"" Harvey said. ""It will definitely help in my workouts and performance. In between starts, it's definitely lit a fire under my rear end and made me strive to be better.""
Harvey explained that after bad starts, he'd go to the weight room to work out. But not after good starts.
""When things are going great, you kind of get comfortable,"" he said. ""I wish I had gone back after good starts and gotten after it a little more.""
Harvey is getting a fresh start with the Angels, having signed a one-year, $11 million deal in December. The club is hoping Harvey can have one of the better bounce-back seasons in recent memory. Just shy of his 30th birthday, Harvey seems intent on recapturing the magic that made every one of his home starts ""Harvey Day"" in Queens when he anchored the Mets' staff.
""My arm feels great, and I can't wait to get out there and start turning things around,"" Harvey told ESPN.
First-year manager Brad Ausmus, wanting to get an up-close look at Harvey, put on catcher's gear and caught Harvey's first bullpen session on Tuesday and was impressed.
The former big league catcher, in his second stint as a manager, doesn't see any reason to coddle Harvey.
""I don't think there's any hand-holding that has to go on,"" Ausmus said. ""Matt Harvey is an adult. That's exactly how we should treat our guys -- like adults -- unless they show us that they shouldn't be. He's not going to get any special treatment.""

25947943,"POWER IS SOMEONE 10 and a half hours away dropping everything at a moment's notice to come see you. It is leverage and, even more, the desire to use it. It is the ability to say absolutely nothing and still be saying everything. And in the case of Kyler Murray, who has not seen a single pitch in professional baseball, who has not thrown a single pass in professional football, and who nevertheless has MLB and the NFL frothing over the notion of him choosing their sport, power may be best illustrated by his capacity to make it seem that what he's doing isn't utterly singular.
In recent weeks, as the MLB Players Association brainstormed before a bargaining session with the league, the union considered asking for dual-sport athletes entering the MLB draft to be eligible for major league contracts, rather than minor league deals subject to a capped amount of spending. In other words: The MLBPA wants a Kyler Murray Rule before it even knows if Kyler Murray is going to play baseball.
Murray has declared for the NFL draft. Can he still play baseball? What are the key dates to pay attention to? Here's what you need to know.
This is what Murray does. He gets people dreaming. He has barely played baseball, and the Oakland A's believed in him enough to choose him with the ninth pick in the 2018 draft and guarantee him $4.66 million. Listed by Oklahoma at 5-foot-10, he is shorter than any quarterback in the NFL, and teams are lining up to choose him in the first round anyway. He is a walking (and running and throwing and swinging) curio, the evolutionary offspring of Bo and Deion, the answer to a question nobody ever bothered asking because it seemed too far-fetched: What if there were someone good enough to play quarterback in the NFL and start in center field in MLB?
Since his Heisman coronation this winter, Murray has mostly stayed mum. As his football season at Oklahoma progressed, though, his rock-solid commitment to baseball wavered: ""I can't put it into words, but I'm just thankful"" became ""As of now, that's the plan"" became ""It's never bad to have options.""
Whatever his decision, the process was always going to play out differently from that of almost any other rookie in the history of sports. Murray owns his future. And to understand why that's so important to him, one simply needs to look at the past.
IN THE SUMMER of 1982, on an awful Rookie ball team in Pikeville, Kentucky, an 18-year-old from Dallas named Kevin Murray hit .161 over a homerless 124 at-bats. He was miserable, even with the $35,000 signing bonus the Brewers gave him after taking him in the 11th round of the draft. When the season was over, he decided he wanted to play football.
Texas A&M loved him. Murray joined the team in spring ball, intent on quitting baseball, at which point the Brewers filed a federal lawsuit seeking an injunction to prevent him from playing football. His baseball contract said no football, and the Brewers argued he was in breach of it.
Eventually, Murray won the right to play, and he started for three seasons at A&M, setting a season record for passing yards and winning 25 games, then a program record for a QB, before entering the NFL draft in 1987. Nineteen quarterbacks were among the 335 players selected. Whether it was because he was a black quarterback or because an ankle injury scared off teams, Murray's name was not called.
When: April 25-27

This is the foundation on which he advises his son, Kyler, and it's why control is at the heart of Kyler's story. He and his family -- father Kevin, mother Missy and his uncle Calvin, a former MLB player and today an employee of agent Scott Boras -- understand this dynamic more than anyone: The athlete is the game, not vice versa. He should brandish the power. He should be able to remind baseball that football is always there, and he should tell football that baseball is a possibility. He should do both without fear that either will do what it did to Kevin Murray.
Kyler's options today would be beyond his father's wildest dreams. He is due to arrive at spring training for the A's on Feb. 15. If he doesn't arrive by March 1, he'll be asked to return six-sevenths of the $1.5 million the A's have paid him -- and he'll lose out on the $3.16 million he's still owed. Even in that case, Murray would be put on Oakland's restricted list, meaning that if he doesn't go where he'd like in the NFL draft on April 25, he'd have the ability to negotiate another deal with the team.
Already the posturing has started: If football wants Murray, he could ask his new team to pay extra for forgoing baseball. If baseball wants Murray, it'll likely need to convert his minor league contract into a major league deal and guarantee him the sort of money he'd make as a first-round NFL pick.
Make no mistake: As much as this is a leverage play, Murray does love baseball. The problem? As one source who knows him well says, ""He really loves playing quarterback."" So when it came time for MLB to make its sales pitch, the league understood Kyler's history -- and played right to it.
IN A HOTEL conference room in Dallas on Jan. 13, Murray sat with his parents, his uncle, Boras, A's owner John Fisher, general manager David Forst and assistant GM Billy Owens. They were listening to someone who understood the allure of playing baseball and football.
Billy Beane was supposed to go to Stanford, where coaches had designs on him playing outfield and eventually taking over at quarterback once John Elway went to the NFL. Beane instead signed with the Mets. When his playing career flopped, he fell into a two-decade run as one of the sport's most creative and influential executives, and his latest magic trick was to try to persuade Murray to leave football behind.
To baseball -- not just the A's but the sport writ large -- beating the NFL for Murray would be a coup. Baseball lacks stars. It fails to ensnare the best athletes. Murray is both. And so as Kevin Murray started asking questions about where Kyler fit into the grand scheme of the game, in jumped Barbara McHugh, MLB's senior vice president of marketing. MLB believed the sell to Murray was important enough to bring her in from London, where she was preparing for this summer's Yankees-Red Sox series.
She showed the room the ""Let the Kids Play"" ad that featured Ken Griffey Jr. and baseball's best young talent. She tried to sell the idea that baseball, whose trouble marketing its players is one of its most acute concerns, could help increase Murray's profile and footprint. Fisher, the owner, emphasized Oakland's in-the-works stadium and commitment to winning. Overall, baseball used the meeting to convince Murray that it would not treat him like it treated his father.
On and on it went, for three hours, ending with thanks and appreciation and no clearer sense of what, exactly, Murray wanted.
AFTER A FEW weeks of silence, Murray emerged leading up to the Super Bowl in a number of public appearances for sponsors. The timing was unfortunate. There was one question to answer, and he had less than zero desire to answer it. When Dan Patrick tried to pin Murray down on his radio show, wondering if he'd hold a pro day at Oklahoma or go to the NFL combine (it has since been reported that he would), the exchange had all the awkwardness of a sixth-grade dance.
""Are you gonna do a pro day?"" Patrick said.
Murray laughed. He looked toward his father. He looked back at Patrick.
""I guess,"" he said. ""If you wanna say -- yeah, I ... yeah.""
""It's OK,"" Patrick said. ""You can have a pro day.""
""That would imply that I was going to play football,"" Murray replied.
""When do you report for the Oakland A's?"" Patrick asked. ""Feb. 15,"" Murray said.
""Ooh, you knew that. OK,"" Patrick said. ""So you're ready to go to do that."" Pause. ""Wait. Are you going to spring training?""
Murray flared his left hand to signal he didn't know.
""Wait. You don't know?"" Patrick said. ""Dad, is he going to spring training? Another no comment here.""
Patrick inhaled a cleansing breath. ""You know, these microphones are on right now?""
""I'm getting pretty good at answering these questions,"" Murray said.
""No, you're not answering them,"" Patrick said.
""Well, exactly,"" Murray replied.
Exactly. When there's a choice and everyone wants a piece of it -- the brands, the marketing nexus, the scoop hunters, the hangers-on, the social media gadflies -- the easiest thing to do is offer nothing.
The game, Murray said without saying anything, will be played on his terms.

Royals general manager Dayton Moore said last week he was open to adding help in the bullpen ahead of spring training. Boxberger could compete with Wily Peralta, who was 14 of 14 in save opportunities last season, for the right to close out games in Kansas City
Boxberger, 30, claimed the closer's role for the Arizona Diamondbacks after being acquired prior to the 2018 season, saving 32 games to go along with a 4.39 ERA. He was not tendered a contract after he earned $1.85 million last season, making him a free agent.
Prior to joining the Diamondbacks, Boxberger spent four seasons with the Tampa Bay Rays, with whom he was an All-Star and led the American League in saves with 41 in 2015.
His most dominant season came as a set-up man in 2014, when he had a 2.37 ERA and struck out 104 batters in 64 2/3 innings. After taking on the closer role in 2015, Boxberger reverted to a set-up role over the next two seasons for the Rays.
The 30-year-old Boxberger was drafted by the Royals in 2006 but went unsigned, instead pitching for USC. He was then drafted by the Reds in 2009. He has a career 3.42 ERA with 76 saves and 368 strikeouts.

25988739,"TAMPA, Fla. -- It really pains Luis Severino to admit this, but tostones are now out of his life.
The New York Yankees ace and self-proclaimed fiend of the tasty twice-fried plantains has cut them out of his diet, along with other delectable treats, in an effort to more adequately fuel his body for the regular-season grind.
""It's not easy,"" the Dominican-born Severino said of recent changes he's made to his eating habits. ""It's tough.""
From big names with something to prove to young stars to get to know, here's what you'll want to keep an eye on during spring training.
The Blue Jays have the big-name splash, but Tampa Bay's quality depth is unmatched, with the Red Sox and Yankees (and Orioles) playing catch-up.
Less than a month after the Yankees' 2018 season ended in an American League Division Series loss to the eventual World Series champion Boston Red Sox, Severino decided it was time to start eating differently. He believed that would help him avoid the late-season fatigue he's battled through the past two seasons.
""When you are at the finish line and you feel like you need a little bit more than five days to be ready, you know that something's going on,"" Severino said as Yankees pitchers and catchers reported to spring training Wednesday.
Last season, Severino pitched 191⅓ innings, exactly two innings less than his career high set in 2017. At times down the stretch in 2018, the Yankees pushed back his starts, giving him an extra day or two to rest as they prepared for the postseason.
""Even though I feel like he was certainly healthy, he probably dealt with some fatigue issues with being a young pitcher in this league, and for the second consecutive year kind of getting around that 200-inning standpoint,"" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Wednesday. ""But in a lot of ways, we saw the normal progression of a young star pitcher. And even though he had some struggles in the second half, he had some flashes where he pitched really well for us, righted the ship a little bit.""
In two playoffs outings, Severino looked like two different pitchers. He gave four solid innings, allowing just two hits and striking out seven, as the Yankees rolled to a wild-card game win over the Oakland Athletics. A week later in the ALDS, he couldn't make it out of the fourth, allowing six runs in a 16-1 rout by the Boston Red Sox.
After that loss, the focus was on Severino's pregame routine. There were concerns that he began his warmups in the bullpen late and that it led to his being out of sync during the start. He and the Yankees denied that was the case.
Even after that, and after concerns throughout the season about Severino tipping pitches, Boone said Wednesday he could still consider the 24-year-old Severino as his Opening Day starter.
""I would say there's a very good chance of that,"" Boone said. ""We hadn't had those kind of conversations exactly yet. But my expectation is that he would be that guy.""
As for Severino's new diet, tostones aren't the only food he has started avoiding. Sweets, fast food and his other favorite, fried chicken, are out of the mix, too. Vegetables and water are the new stars at his dinner table.
""I hate eating vegetables,"" Severino said, smiling.
The changes have apparently had their benefits. The right-hander said he reported to camp about 12 to 15 pounds lighter, and he can already feel how the lessened load has helped.
""Where I came from, we just eat anything we see in the fridge, fried and fast food,"" Severino said. ""But we're eating more vegetables and stuff like that, and get your body going faster and then recover fast. So that's my main stuff, focusing on my workouts and avoiding doing a lot of weights that maybe make me a lot more tired.""
Severino also has made running a major part of his training routine, much like he did last offseason.
The decision to alter his eating habits wasn't one he came to lightly, nor on his own. Prior to making it, he had conversations with the Yankees' nutritionist, as well as other nutritionists in the Dominican Republic, where he trains and lives.

Players, managers and coaches will wear a patch on their right sleeves of a batter in white prepared to hit a white ball, with a blue background in front of the batter and red behind.

The 1969 logo, designed by Jerry Dior of Sandgren & Murtha, had a white border and ""100TH ANNIVERSARY"" below in red. The logo became MLB's official mark as the commissioner's office took a more prominent role in the American and National Leagues. The logo was put on the backs of caps starting in 1993 and the back of jersey necks in 2000, according to Uni Watch.
The 1994 logo changed the batter and ball to gold, had ""125th ANNIVERSARY"" below and was surrounded by a gold and black border. This year's patch has a darker blue.
Teams also wore a logo in 1939 to commemorate the now discredited myth that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839 at Cooperstown, New York.
MLB said the 150th anniversary patch also will be on caps for March 28 openers.

25980650,"""This might be TMI,"" San Francisco's star catcher noted, perhaps providing too much information. ""I could really feel the right side of my gluteus maximus engage -- hadn't really felt that in a while. With all leg exercises, I feel like things have been more symmetrical, so hopefully that's a good sign.""
We start our position-by-position tiers at catcher, where franchise performers aren't exactly easy to come by in 2019.
Justin Verlander leads a chorus of former MVPs who are saying the absence of clear free-agent markets for Bryce Harper and Manny Machado is not good for the game.
San Francisco pitchers and catchers report this week, and Posey plans to be a full participant from Day 1 of spring training Wednesday, pulling on the catcher's gear and squatting behind the plate for his part in pitchers' bullpens early in camp. He understands there likely will be some modifications to his workload at the beginning just to be safe.
And being in the lineup behind the plate on opening day March 28 at San Diego, Posey is absolutely planning on it.
""As of now, no, not at all,"" he said of having any level of concern about being ready.
When Posey began swinging a bat again at the start of the year, he considered that another critical step in his return and feeling right.
He put on the catching gear again for a commercial Feb. 7.
""I kind of had that feeling a little bit already just when I got to hit,"" he said of getting back in the batting cage. ""I was like, 'Man, this feels good. It feels good to be able to swing and feel like I'm swinging how I want to.'""
Still, he knows there's far more to it.
""I'm able to hit, throw, run and everything's feeling good,"" Posey said. ""Having said that, it's still not the same as getting on the field for live BP or the games in spring training. Then, obviously, the season's a completely different animal. But I'm optimistic that it'll be fun.""
New Giants president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi insists the Giants will not push Posey, taking a cautious approach with one of their franchise players to make sure he stays on the field for the long haul. Stephen Vogt reached a minor league deal this week, and Rene Rivera received a minor league contract last week to give the Giants depth at catcher.
""I do know that we're going to be smart about it, careful about it, not just going into camp but even going into the season,"" Zaidi said. ""If things go super, super well, even if he's ready to carry a full catching load to start the season, I'm not sure that would be the prudent course for us, so I think we're really going to err on the side of caution.""
Of course, Posey wants to play, especially after the way 2018 went for him personally and the team.
The Giants finished 73-89, including a majors-worst 5-21 in September, yet bettered their last-place 2017 finish of 64-98.
""Again, I think you have to be open to new thoughts and always be willing to adjust,"" Posey said. ""I do know that there's been times late in seasons on years that I've felt really good where I've been like, 'Man, I'm running low right now.' So it would be hard to say that if that type of strategy would pay dividends in late September or early October, but there's probably numbers that say they do, I'm guessing.""
The 31-year-old Posey hopes that with a healthy hip, his power numbers will improve as the 2010 NL Rookie of the Year and 2012 MVP begins his 10th -- yes, that's right -- full major league season.
He batted .284 with five home runs and 41 RBIs in 2018 while limited to 105 games. Even throwing seemed to put more stress on his shoulder with the troublesome hip, which needed repair for a torn labrum as well as removal of an impingement.
Even if Posey hadn't needed surgery, he said players must constantly adapt and find new ways to prepare physically and mentally for the grind of a 162-game season.
""I think regardless of hip injury, surgery or whatnot, you're having to evolve and change how you're going about your day just as the years go by, so, yeah, I've changed the way I go about getting ready,"" he said. ""I used to be able to just walk into a gym cold and jump on the squat rack. But those days are gone.""
Manager Bruce Bochy gives Posey periodic starts at first base to take some stress off his body. Posey made 13 starts at first last year and 30 in 2017.
Everyone around the Giants expects a strong comeback by the six-time All-Star.
""I'm sure it's going to be able to help out, the hip, being able to release it on the swing,"" Bochy said. ""I've listened to our medical staff, and they're confident this is really going to help Buster out as far as catching, throwing and on the hitting side, so I'm confident.""

Morrow, 34, intends to throw from 90 feet this week and then slowly advance to longer distances before getting back on the mound. Though he still had some pain at the end of last season, MRIs showed no damage to his elbow. That led to a more intrusive CT scan that did find an issue. Surgery followed.
""Missing just the first month this year will be better than missing the last three months last year,"" Morrow said.
The reliever dismissed any notion that Joe Maddon pitched him too much, leading to the injury, though the team intimated at the time that throwing three games in a row in June led to his downfall.
""I don't think I was pushed into an injury,"" Morrow said. ""Was just one of those things that happened.""
Pedro Strop received many of the save opportunities in Morrow's absence last year, and the Cubs added veteran reliever Brad Brach this past offseason.
""I have utmost confidence in those guys,"" Morrow said. ""They actually all have a better track record than I do as bullpen pitchers.""

The Athletics' pitchers and catchers will hold their first workout of spring training on Monday. Position players are scheduled to report on Friday.
""Things have certainly changed since the draft,'' Billy Beane, Oakland's executive vice president of baseball operations, said Monday. ""The situation is fluid right now and based on a historic college football season that the young man had.''

""I don't have any answers for you, and I probably won't until we've decided on the process,'' Beane said. ""All I can tell you is it hasn't been decided and the conversations will continue.''
Beane would not reveal a timeline in regards to making a decision about Murray's future. The NFL combine begins Feb. 26.
Murray's baseball deal called for him to receive $1.5 million within 30 days of the deal's approval last summer by Major League Baseball and $3.16 million on March 1. If he doesn't play baseball, Oakland would get back the money it already has paid and not have to give Murray the remainder.
Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders played both football and baseball, but Jackson was a running back and Sanders a cornerback.

25952976,"Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Friday that management is focused on pace-of-game changes for 2019, and bolder ideas proposed by the players' association are too complex to be put in place for this season.
Bigger rosters? A universal DH? Punishment for tanking teams? We weigh what shaking up the national pastime will do to the game.
As the newly combine-bound Kyler Murray decides which sport will win his talents, at least one thing is clear: He owns his future in a way no other rookie has.
Speaking Friday after an owners' meeting, Manfred felt encouraged that the union responded to management's proposal for a pitch clock and a three-batter minimum for a relief pitcher unless an inning ends.
""Some of these items need to be part of broader discussions that certainly will continue after opening day, and I hope we can focus on some of the issues that need to get resolved quickly in the interim,"" Manfred said.
Baseball is in the third year of a five-year labor deal, one in which the free-agent market has slowed considerably -- even with premier players such as Bryce Harper and Manny Machado available. Management would discuss larger changes as part of a deal for a new collective bargaining agreement extending beyond December 2021.
""I hope and I really do believe that there is a common interest between the players' association, the players, the owners and the commissioner's office in changes, whether they're midterm or otherwise, that make our entertainment product the best it could possibly be,"" Manfred said.
After the 2016 and 2017 seasons, players rebuffed management's proposal for a pitch clock designed to speed the pace of play. Management has the right to implement a clock, but Manfred has been reluctant to make on-field changes without players' agreement.
Management presented its latest proposal Jan. 14, and it included a requirement that pitchers face at least three batters or finish an inning. Players responded Feb. 1 with a broader plan, renewing their push for the DH in all games, an earlier trade deadline aimed at discouraging teams with losing records from trading stars, increasing service time for top young stars called up early in the season, and rewarding and penalizing teams in the draft based on their records.
""Those are significant economic issues. They are different in kind than the type of playing-rule changes that we have out there,"" Manfred said. ""I think that there are pieces of their response on the on-field proposal that were very encouraging. I think what needs to be sorted out is how closely the two agendas are tied, in other words, the on-field stuff and the economic stuff.""
Last offseason, negotiations were hampered by player anger over the slow free-agent market. This offseason's pace of signings has been faster but remains far slower than most previous years.
""We want players signed, particularly star players. I wish they were signed and ready to go,"" Manfred said. ""We got another week before they have to report. I'm really hopeful that it's going to get resolved during that period of time.""
MLB's proposal that pitchers face a minimum of three batters in an inning unless it ends was designed both for pace and to slow or reverse the increased use of relievers. The union wants its use at the big league level delayed until 2020.
""Repeated pitching changes obviously take a lot of time,"" Manfred said. ""The idea of relievers having to go longer is appealing in terms of promoting the role of the starting pitcher, encouraging pitchers to pitch a little longer at the beginning of the game. ... I think historically some of our biggest stars [are] starting pitchers, and we want to make sure those big stars are out there long enough that they are marketed.""
On other matters:
ATTENDANCE
After three straight years of drops that left attendance at its lowest since 2003, Manfred said it is too early to speculate about 2019.
""We're hopeful that we see a rebound from last year, but, again, difficult to predict at this point,"" he said.
He said he doesn't think the operation of the free-agent market was an issue affecting ticket sales.
""I do think that negative commentary surrounding the game that is not factually supported can have an impact on attendance -- assertions about clubs not trying to win and the like, I think that's not helpful,"" he said.
GAMBLING
MLB has talked to the union about expanding the anti-gambling provision section of the Major League Rules to prohibit the disclosure of confidential information that could be used in betting.
REVENUE SHARING GRIEVANCE
Manfred said the union is still in the fact-gathering stage of its grievance filed last winter accusing Miami, Oakland, Pittsburgh and Tampa Bay of not properly spending money they received in revenue sharing.
SOCIAL MEDIA
MLB will make game highlights available to players for use on social media.
150TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRO BALL
Teams will wear a special patch to mark the 150th anniversary of professional baseball, and there will be special hats on opening day. The Cincinnati Reds, the first pro team in 1869, will be at the forefront of the celebration.
REGIONAL SPORTS NETWORKS
MLB received a second round of data in its effort to purchase 14 team regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co., which is selling them after acquiring the networks from 21st Century Fox. If successful, MLB could resell rights to streaming services or cable providers. ""I think that we recognize that the media landscape is changing quickly, and if somebody is going to be managing that changing landscape, we just as soon that it be us,"" Manfred said.
RAWLINGS
MLB extended its agreement with Rawlings to supply baseballs, a deal that includes helmets and gloves.
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL
Boston's John Henry and Colorado's Dick Monfort were elected to the executive council, replacing Atlanta's Terry McGuirk and the New York Yankees' Hal Steinbrenner. The council includes the Chicago Cubs' Tom Ricketts and Tampa Bay's Stu Sternberg (whose terms expire in 2020); San Diego's Ron Fowler and Houston's Jim Crane (2021); and Milwaukee's Mark Attanasio and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox (2022).

The 32-year-old Bailey has spent his entire 12-year career in Cincinnati, making 212 starts and going 67-77 with a 4.56 ERA. Bailey was traded from the Reds to the Dodgers in a seven-player deal in December, but he was released and became a free agent.
If he is added to the 40-man roster, Bailey would get the $555,000 big league minimum from the Royals, which would be offset against the $23 million he is owed by the Dodgers in the final guaranteed season of a $105 million, six-year deal he signed with Cincinnati.
Bailey has thrown a pair of no-hitters, the first against Pittsburgh in September 2012 and the other against San Francisco the following July. He won 24 games over those two seasons.
He's also dealt with injuries the past few years, though, starting the season on the disabled list each year from 2015 to 2017. Bailey made eight starts total in 2015 and 2016.

25989568,"MESA, Ariz. -- Saying he's in a better place both mentally and physically this spring, Chicago Cubs righty Yu Darvish is looking to rebound after a season to forget in 2018. Poor performance gave way to an elbow injury last season, but he says that's all behind him now.
Darvish was asked if the situation was weighing on him last year after signing a six-year, $126 million contract with the Cubs.
""At that time, I didn't say anything about that, but definitely I was thinking about, 'I have to do something for the Cubs like win 20 games or something,'"" Darvish said Wednesday. ""This year I want to be myself.""
The Chicago Cubs will be without closer Brandon Morrow for the early portion of 2019 after he had elbow surgery.
The Chicago Cubs are launching their own television network, beginning in 2020, partnering with Sinclair Broadcasting to create Marquee Sports Network.
Darvish, who was raised in Japan, spoke to reporters in English -- another sign he's feeling more comfortable in his surroundings -- after throwing his first bullpen session of the spring. He declared himself 100 percent ready for the new season while continuing to open up about his feelings over the past 12 months, something his manager took note of.
""It's always impressive when someone exposes themselves,"" manager Joe Maddon stated after workouts for the day were over. ""It's not easy to do so. I give him credit for that. It's a part of moving forward, I think. ... We all need to spill it out there once in a while to heal. I'm glad that he did that.""
Darvish, a four-time All-Star, went 1-3 with a 4.95 ERA in 2018 before going down with an elbow injury. Starts and stops in his comeback attempt exasperated fans, and eventually he was shut down after just eight big league outings. He said he finally started to feel like himself again late last year, with the injury behind him and a year in Chicago under his belt -- though it was a rough one.
""I'm looking forward to doing something [positive] this year,"" Darvish said. ""My mental [state] is way better than last year too. ... I want to stay healthy and make 32-33 starts. I want to win more for the Cubs.""
They could use him. The rotation is talented but aging, and health will be a key component to its success.
""If you slide him in there, it just makes our rotation even deeper,"" teammate Jon Lester said. ""It's a huge boost for us if we get the Darvish that we all know. Hopefully everything is behind him.""
Maddon added: ""He just looks good. He seems more comfortable.""

2593505,"Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association are discussing potentially drastic changes to the on-field game and economic landscape of the sport in the middle of a collective bargaining agreement, a significant departure from the past that speaks to the chasm between the parties but represents a thaw in the chill that has divided the sides, sources familiar with the talks told ESPN.
Dueling proposals from MLB on Jan. 14 and the union on Friday covered a wide range of topics, according to sources. Among them include:
A three-batter minimum for pitchers
A universal designated hitter
A single trade deadline before the All-Star break
A 20-second pitch clock
The expansion of rosters to 26 men, with a 12-pitcher maximum
Draft advantages for winning teams and penalties for losing teams
A study to lower the mound
A rule that would allow two-sport amateurs to sign major league contracts
With owners meetings set to begin this week and spring training next week amid another tepid free-agent market, the willingness to bandy about ideas -- and the openness to addressing concerns -- is seen as a step in the right direction by both sides. Whether any substantive change comes of it, sources said, remains unclear.
The three-batter minimum for pitchers, first reported by The Athletic, is perhaps the most controversial measure, as it would ostensibly eliminate a job created by modern bullpen use: the one-out left-handed reliever. MLB's proposal of the idea illustrates the league's concern with both time and pace of game, as constant bullpen shuffling has contributed to the average game time lasting longer than three hours. The rule would apply to all pitchers, except in instances in which pitchers finish an inning or are injured, sources said.
We're still waiting for this winter's big free agents to sign, but that didn't stop us from predicting which uniforms they'll be wearing in the Midsummer Classic. Who else makes our star-studded squads?
Days before spring training begins, the offseason's marquee name is adding suitors instead of making his way to camp with a new team. Here's what MLB must do to repair its busted hot stove.
If -- and when -- the National League adopts the designated hitter, these dominoes will fall.
The union did not strongly oppose the idea, according to sources, instead suggesting it preferred the implementation to be delayed until 2020 rather than 2019, as MLB proposed.
The league's other bid to deal with pace of play was the enactment of a 20-second pitch clock, something commissioner Rob Manfred can put into place unilaterally. While numerous players have spoken out against the pitch clock, the recognition that Manfred has the ability to mandate it, even without the union's support, gives him leverage on the issue, according to sources.
In the discussions, the possibility of the clock being turned off when runners are on base was raised, sources said.
One of the union's counterproposals was the adoption of the designated hitter in the National League, according to sources. While a compromise could be the rule being eased in, the union is advocating for a universal DH in 2019, sources said.
In addition to the universal DH, the MLBPA is interested in changes that would use draft picks to incentivize winning and grant players the ability to earn additional service, which could allow them to hit free agency earlier and theoretically counteract what the union believes is the manipulation of service time by teams.
Low-revenue teams that succeed -- whether by finishing above .500 or making the playoffs -- would be given greater draft positions or bonus pools under the union's proposal, according to sources. While the depth of the penalties were not clear, the union suggested teams that lose 90-plus games in consecutive years could be affected negatively in the draft.
In the wake of Oakland Athletics first-round pick Kyler Murray potentially leaving behind baseball to pursue an NFL career after a Heisman Trophy-winning season, the union also suggested the idea of bringing back the major league contract as an enticement for two-sport athletes to stick with baseball, sources said. Currently, all draft contracts are minor league deals subject to a draft pool that penalizes teams that exceed it.
Service-time issues remain a key concern for the union, according to sources, with teams capable of keeping major league-ready players in the minor leagues without recourse. While both sides acknowledge service time is a difficult problem to solve, the union's proposal included the possibility of additional service time for performance, playoff appearances or awards, according to sources.
Among the union's ideas was a single trade deadline before the All-Star break, sources said. Currently, the non-waiver trade deadline is July 31, and players who pass through waivers can be dealt until Aug. 31. An earlier trade deadline could force teams to emphasize the first half, which might force them to focus more in the offseason on acquiring players via free agency to improve the likelihood of that rather than allowing them to strike well past the 100-game mark.
MLB's carrot in its proposal was an expansion of roster size from 25 to 26, creating 30 new major league jobs, according to sources. The offering included a 28-man limit on September rosters and a maximum of 12 pitchers during non-September games, sources said.
The league also is interested in studying mound height, with the potential for Manfred to implement a lowering of the mound in 2020, according to sources.
Another league proposal would end all spring training games that are tied after 10 innings and use spring training and the All-Star Game as testing grounds for the rule that starts a runner on second base in the 10th inning of a tied game.
In typical bargaining sessions, dozens of ideas are offered, considered and placed on the back burner, so the likelihood of a handful of these proposals being ratified, let alone all of them, is unlikely, according to sources. Still, as MLB and the union seek to find a place of understanding amid a winter chill that has fractured already-tenuous relations, the mere discussion, sources said, is considered a positive.

25900456,"How well do you know the Patriots, and what's the takeaway from one of the great dynasties of this era?
Jed Hoyer: We've sat and talked to those guys. They're phenomenal. Bill Belichick and I have the Wesleyan connection. What to take from it? The continuity they have and the consistency they have is just incredible. Take away the individual brilliance of Bill and Tom Brady, a lot of it is just about that continuity they have as an organization. It helps them avoid distractions. Their consistency is mind-blowing in a league where there is none.
You mention distractions. The Patriots seem to have mastered avoiding any semblance of one, not just within a season but within an era of football. I mean, some people think -- me included -- you guys are still dealing with the aftermath of winning it all in 2016. They never, for example, have a championship hangover. Does that resonate?
Which stars of tomorrow are tearing up the minors today? Keith Law ranks the top 100 prospects in baseball.  Nos. 1-50 | 51-100 | Complete prospect coverage
JH: It's remarkable. They just know who they are as an organization. They know exactly the type of players and coaches they want to bring in, and their focus doesn't change. Their strategy changes from week to week, but as far as the people and players they bring in, they're incredibly consistent. All of that helps to avoid distractions. I can only imagine being an opponent.
Let's turn to your sport. Do you think it fundamentally hurts baseball the way the past two offseasons have gone strictly in terms of timing? Even when the bigger names sign, I'm not sure it will be as celebrated as if they happened in November or December.
JH: I don't enjoy this, but at the same time, it's kept baseball in the news, even if people are getting tired of the stories. It used to be these things were done by the middle of December. Now they're dragging out, and ultimately I don't think it's good for the players, teams or the industry to have eternal offseasons like this. I hope we get back to a situation where we use the month of November. That month is barely being used for player discussion. That starts now in December. I hope we push the calendar back again.
What can be done?
JH: I think both sides should get their heads together and figure how do we move things back. Other sports don't have this problem because they have salary caps. Their urgency is based on the finite dollars because of the cap. We don't have that. It's hard to argue with anyone expressing disappointment with how slow the market is moving.
During the Cubs convention, Kris Bryant spoke out about the lack of interest in the bigger-name free agents and how free agency is going in general. He didn't say his own team by name, but obviously that includes the Cubs. He wondered how any team would not be interested in his friend Bryce Harper. How does the team feel about those comments?
JH: When it comes to spending, we have one of the top payrolls in the game. We've spent a lot of money. Some of that is on our young, core players. Some has been on big free-agency signings. Our spending is at a significant level.
So much talk about your budget this offseason reminds people that you've paid a lot for pitching over the years because you haven't developed your own draft picks. It's a topic you are familiar with. Does it continue to be a fair criticism?
JH: Totally fair. We were tighter this winter for a number of reasons, and one of them is we have an expensive pitching staff. It's a good one, but expensive, in part because we haven't had the same kind of zero-to-three [years] of inexpensive pitchers coming through the system like we did with hitters. One of the things we did do this winter was bring Cole Hamels back. It was the absolute right thing to do. That made an expensive rotation even more expensive. Some of the moves made last winter haven't worked out yet. We think they will, but they haven't yet. That leaves us with an expensive rotation for a variety of reasons.
Always Late with Katie Nolan is a late-night sports comedy show covering the big (and small) stories of the week. Watch on ESPN+
You've turned over some of your minor league infrastructure. You've studied this. Why has developing pitching been an issue? Bad luck?
JH: I'll say this. A big part of being successful in this job is being accountable, not only publicly but also internally. We've spent an unbelievable amount of time talking about that and what we can change. What are we not doing, besides using our high picks on hitters? I don't think you can point to luck. I think that's a crutch. It's on us to continue to ask the right questions and try to figure it out. When we were building, we did acquire a number of inexpensive pitchers, but what we haven't done is taken from the draft and developed.
You mentioned Hamels. In hindsight, with a less flexible offseason, I think people have wondered if using those dollars on him instead of hitting was worth it.
JH: Zero second thoughts. Cole had such an incredible impact on our pitching staff, on our clubhouse. He was totally rejuvenated coming over here. We loved having him. Having a talent like Cole both on and off the field, on a contract like that for one year, seemed like the right thing to do. No regrets whatsoever.
What has it been like balancing the disappointment of the end of last season with the knowledge that you won 95 games?
JH: Every season that doesn't end in a World Series title, you can't feel like it had no meaning. It's just the nature of our sport. But that said, I love the fact that we've gotten to a place where we won 95 games and made the playoffs, and it was considered a disappointment. In some ways, I look at that as a success. We have changed the standard and the culture here, both internally and externally. And the expectations are higher. We had brutal, raw, emotional exit meetings for four days after we lost last season. Five years ago, that season would have been a huge success. I'm proud of that. Now, the key is going further.
Can the Cubs get back to playing the underdog card? Is that possible in a post-World Series-winning world? Would that be a good thing?
JH: There's nothing wrong with having some doubt. In '16, we were clearly the best team in the division, and we embraced that target. That's not the case right now. Our division is the deepest in baseball. Every division series is going to be a real battle. In some ways, that's really good. People are going to pick a lot of different teams to win our division. Complacency is kind of a loaded word, but do I think we played with the same urgency we played with in 2016? No. We just talked about the Patriots. You want that mentality every year. They've created that. We've had good years by normal standards, but have we had that same urgency we had in 2016? No. We need to get back to that.
You hired a 37-year-old pitching coach, Tommy Hottovoy, who spent his time at the computer last year, though he worked with all your pitchers. Is this a millennial-type experiment, or did he earn it just like anyone else would?
When it comes to the standings, less is more. Plus, how good is your favorite team's roster -- and Babe Ruth -- really?

Spring training is almost here. Check out reporting dates for teams in Florida and Arizona, including the defending champion Red Sox.
JH: No. I think he's going to be a star. I think he's done an amazing job, but largely behind the scenes, working in run prevention. I think we've always looked at him as a guy that can do anything in this game. I think he's going to excel in that role. No question -- the work ethic, the relationships with the pitchers, his mind, his fascination with pitching -- he's going to be great. I'm really excited. Of course, he'll develop in the role.
Recently, you hired Adam Beard, previously with the Cleveland Browns, to oversee all aspects of a player's off-field development, from nutrition to mental health and everything in between. It seems like a trend to hire that type of czar, so to speak. Why now?
JH: This model is one a lot of sports teams in Europe use. Adam has had a great career. The goal is to make sure every single player's care is as well communicated and thought out as possible. Having someone overseeing all those areas and bringing everyone together seemed like the right thing. How do we sync up our player-care infrastructure as well as we can? Adam will do that. When it comes to athlete care, I think he's going to bring a lot of things that are at the forefront of injury prevention.
We haven't talked much about your offense. Is it still your hope and expectation that it will round out the way you thought? Perhaps utilizing the best that Chili Davis brought, the best that John Mallee brought and now Anthony Iopace, combined, of course, with the players' talent.
JH: We always imagined 26, 27, 28 years old, when those guys hit that critical area of their talent and experience matching up, we'd be a monster of an offense. We've had our moments, but that's not what happened last year in the second half. You want that power we showed in '17 with some situational awareness and some veteran know-how. I think we'll get there. It probably didn't happen as quickly as we thought. Candidly, we thought going into 2018 we were in a different place offensively than we ended up. But I think we're going to get there. In fact, we're going to benefit from what happened in the second half last year.
OK, now the big question: What's your prediction for Sunday?
JH: I have Patriots winning 31-27. It's a one-possession game. Every time I think it's going to be lopsided, one way or another, it never is. It will be close. The Rams have elite players, but the way the Patriots have played the last two games, I like them.

25931480,"Asked by TMZ Sports in a brief red-carpet interview this week, Judge said any time a team can add a player of Harper's caliber, it ""is going to make them better."" Harper, 26, is a six-time All-Star and former National League MVP for the Washington Nationals.
Judge was asked who would move from right to center field in the event New York was able to add Harper to an already-crowded outfield.
""He's got more speed than me, man,"" Judge said, smiling. ""Wherever he wants to play. We'll make it work.""
The Yankees outfielder is 35 and hasn't played in a major league game in 476 days. Still, San Francisco picked up the phone. Is there an unlikely deal to be made?
The top outfielder on the free-agent market is set to make big bucks. We put you in Bryce Harper's shoes. Where will you go?
San Diego has plenty of salary flexibility to land a big fish and a slew of hot prospects on the way. But do the Padres want to go for it?
Just before getting honored at the Thurman Munson Awards in Manhattan on Tuesday evening, Yankees manager Aaron Boone said any similar scenario involving the two outfielders was currently an unrealistic one.
""That was just Judgey having some fun at the Super Bowl,"" Boone said. ""Judgey would do a lot of things for the team. But I don't know. I think that he was just probably pressed in the corner at the Super Bowl and he gave a good answer.
""But I don't think we're going to have to worry about that.""
There's at least one reason that scenario won't be happening. Aaron Hicks, who is coming off the best year of his career following a 27-homer, 79-RBI campaign, is expected to remain the Yankees' starter at the position in 2019. Brett Gardner, 35, enters spring training as the incumbent in left field, with Clint Frazier and Jacoby Ellsbury returning from injuries to compete for playing time there.
Giancarlo Stanton also factors into the Yankees' outfield plans. The team's primary designated hitter, he also spent 37 games playing right field last season. Many of those chances came after Judge suffered a wrist injury that sidelined him about two months.
The Yankees, fresh off an American League Division Series loss to the eventual World Series champion Boston Red Sox, have been rumored at times this offseason to be trying to pursue either Harper or Manny Machado. Although Yankees general manager Brian Cashman refuted such rumored interest in Harper during the Winter Meetings in December, he and other team officials did meet with Machado late that month.
The odds at this late offseason date are not high that either player ends up with the Yankees.
""Obviously [Harper] is a great player. But I think our team is pretty much set,"" Boone said. ""Obviously things happen that force Brian and his staff to pivot on certain things. But I think it's safe to assume that we're going to spring training with the team that we expect to have.""
Yankees third baseman Miguel Andujar and shortstop Didi Gregorius were being honored alongside Boone at Tuesday's awards dinner. A Machado signing could have adversely impacted both players' playing time. Even still, both infielders contended they would have had little concern about that if Machado had come to the Bronx.
""If he comes over, he makes the team better,"" Gregorius said.
The way Boone sees it, this team already appears to be in its best form, even without Harper or Machado in the mix.
""You never say never with anything, but we're anticipating that we have a great team right now and feel like we have a complete team that's ready to go compete for a championship,"" the manager said.
As for Judge's message through TMZ to Harper, Machado and other remaining free agents?
""I got nothing,"" Judge said. ""Make the right choice. Wherever they want to go. Make it the right choice for your family.""

25974053,"MESA, Ariz. -- Eventually, Willson Contreras got bored. The offseason had gone on long enough. The Chicago Cubs catcher was used to playing baseball deep into the fall, but a team-wide offensive flameout last year led to a long winter.
So on Monday morning, a day before catchers and pitchers reported, Contreras was already taking his swings in the cage, attempting to put a down 2018 season for him and the team behind him.
""I think we needed that (losing early),"" Contreras said after he was finished hitting. ""We tried to do our best but it didn't work out...This was my first offseason having October off. It was really weird for me. I was really uncomfortable at first.""
A winter of discontent for the Chicago Cubs has finally given way to a spring of cautious optimism as camp opens for the 2016 World Series champions. That historic title -- coming 108 years after their last one -- feels like a decade ago as the team and organization have taken a bit of a hit in the interim.
Of course, that's partly because expectations from a rabid fan base -- thinking about a Cubs dynasty -- have come up short since November 2016. It hasn't helped their narrative that the team did little to improve its roster this offseason, is bringing back a player suspended for domestic abuse allegations, and recently had to distance itself from racist and bigoted email exchanges by the father of the team owner. Discontent might be an understatement.
""This year is really a reckoning in a lot of ways,"" Team president Theo Epstein said during the winter. ""We do have a lot to prove.""
From big names with something to prove to young stars to get to know, here's what you'll want to keep an eye on during spring training.
We're still waiting for this winter's big free agents to sign, but that didn't stop us from predicting which uniforms they'll be wearing in the Midsummer Classic. Who else makes our star-studded squads?
Days before spring training begins, the offseason's marquee name is adding suitors instead of making his way to camp with a new team. Here's what MLB must do to repair its busted hot stove.
Epstein was referring to his team on the field, which, by the way, won 95 games last season before losing the NL Central tiebreaker and the wild-card game. But that statement could apply to the off-the-field concerns as well. Can they navigate the possible return of shortstop Addison Russell when his 40-game suspension is over in May? He would become the first prominent player to return to his old team after serving a significant suspension for violating baseball's domestic abuse policies. Others in similar situations have moved on, but the Cubs insist they want to be part of the solution, which includes monitoring Russell's counseling and therapy. The team is also likely to make amends, where they can, after the revelation of racist emails sent and replied to by Joe Ricketts, patriarch of the Ricketts family who own the Cubs.
It's under that backdrop the team begins spring training with a lame-duck manager. The Cubs hate what the word means as they continue to profess faith in Joe Maddon. But the reality of the situation is simply this: There's a chance Maddon could take the Cubs to the postseason in all five of his five years as manager and still be out of a job next winter. As is, the perception is that if he goes 4 for 5, he'll be out of a job. It's a sign of the times when perennial playoff managers are losing gigs in favor of younger and cheaper options. That's not to say Maddon is coming off his best year in the dugout. Far from it.
He's 37 and throwing 99. Baseball's best comeback story will be playing out during spring training. Jeff Passan »
The off-the-field issues have divided some Cubs fans, but what unites many of them is a belief the team pulled a fast one on them by doing very little to improve the roster for 2019. This was supposed to be the year Las Vegas natives and friends Bryce Harper and Kris Bryant joined forces. Or at least that's what many thought would happen, though the Cubs never once forecast  such a union. After failing miserably on offense late last season, the team changed just it's 25th man on the roster, adding Daniel Descalso while subtracting Tommy La Stella. After ceding the division to the Milwaukee Brewers, doubt has begun to creep into the Cubs narrative. Was the end of 2018 the beginning of something bad for the Cubs or just a blip? After all, it's hard to improve or be upset with a 95-win year. The Cubs may simply embrace the underdog role just as they did being the favorite back in 2016.
There's nothing wrong with having some doubt,"" general manager Jed Hoyer said recently. ""In '16, we were clearly the best team in the division, and we embraced that target. That's not the case right now.""
If Maddon needs some bulletin-board material, perhaps he can post PECOTA's predictions. Annually, the Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm spits out its win/loss predictions for every team. It has the Cubs going 82-80 this year. 82 wins? That's blasphemy for the team with the most wins in baseball over the past four regular seasons, averaging just under 97 wins per year. Even Las Vegas, always a friendly place for Cubs bettors, doesn't think the team will win 90 games.
So what's the solution? Urgency. Even in winning 95 last year, there wasn't enough.
""Complacency is kind of a loaded word, but do I think we played with the same urgency we played with in 2016?"" Hoyer wondered. ""No.""
Epstein added, early in the winter: ""(It) sounds funny coming off 95 wins. I feel like we underperformed. I think you're going to see a really highly motivated group of players out there. Whether we have a big offseason or more nuanced offseason, you should judge us on how we play next year.""

We now know it's been a more nuanced winter for the Cubs, meaning all the focus is on the team that came up short last year -- which is mostly the same team that won the World Series. PECOTA thinks their starting staff is too old, fans think the offense is still broken and no one is quite sure how the bullpen will fare with closer Brandon Morrow already down to start the spring. But even with question marks, few will count the Cubs out. There's still a lot of talent. Perhaps 82 wins won't be a shock but neither would be 97.
""We feel like as though we have all the ingredients in the bowl,"" Maddon said. ""I'm all about development ... I'm with the guys, Theo and Jed, regarding definitely trying to extrapolate more out of the group we already have because there's a lot more left.""
Maddon spent the offseason learning what makes millennials tick while the front office has made behind-the-scenes changes to how they want their players to attack each day.
Meanwhile, the other NL Central teams have added to their rosters, leading to those predictive models suggesting no one will win 90 games in the division.
""People are going to pick a lot of different teams to win our division,"" Hoyer said. ""We've had good years by normal standards.""
""Normal"" left the building the moment the Cubs won it all in 2016. Fans want nothing less than another title -- or at least a better shot at one than the team gave last season. There were extenuating circumstances -- injuries and a rough schedule were real. So there's hope mixed in with the doubt. It's the beauty of baseball and the reality of the Chicago Cubs as 2019 begins. A year of reckoning indeed, especially for its manager.
""I came up on one-year deals, but you always felt if you worked well and did your job that stuff will take care of itself,"" Maddon stated. ""I still believe in those principles.""

25974959,"Known throughout his baseball career as Zach, the 31-year-old New York Yankees reliever said last week that going forward his name should be spelled Zack.
""I was born with a 'ch', sorry, excuse me, the 'ck,"" Britton said Monday after his first pre-spring training workout at the New York Yankees' minor league complex.
Britton was traded to the Yankees from Baltimore last summer, became a free agent and agreed to a $39 million, three-year contract with New York last month. The contract initially used Zach before it was changed.
""My wife is an attorney, and she's like legally we need to change it because legally that's not your name,"" Britton said. ""The Orioles always put `k' on any, like, legal documents and then they just went with an `h' (on printed rosters). The Yankees just felt like it was better for everybody if I just kept it with a `k,' and I was like, yeah, why not?""
Britton said with a smile that he's ""blaming my parents"" because they had told him it was an 'h.'
Britton tweeted last Thursday ""I will be going by my legal name 'Zack' instead of my stage name,"" and added ""everyone continue to breath normally.""
The attention it drew on social media came as a surprise.
""I was just like kind of a funny joke and it kind of took off,"" Britton said
His name was spelled ""Zachary G. Britton"" by Major League Baseball when the Baltimore Orioles selected him in the third round of the 2006 amateur draft with the 85th overall pick and he was listed as ""Zach"" in each of Baltimore's media guides starting in 2007. He made his major league debut in 2011 and was an All-Star in 2015 and `16.
He is listed as ""Zackary Grantantero Britton"" in the California Birth Index, ""Zackary Grant Antero Britton"" in his 2017 Texas voter registration and ""Zackary G. Britton"" in his 2015 Nevada voter registration. His auto registrations have been as ""Zackary"" and ""Zack.""
Britton had Achilles' tendon surgery in December 2017 that delayed his first big league outing last year until June 12. He ran a mile Monday for the first time since the surgery.
It's a drastic change from one year ago.
""I was learning to walk again on an underwater treadmill probably at this time,"" Britton said. ""A huge difference. So, I just feel like a normal guy.""

Gregorius also took grounders with Troy Tulowitzki, who was signed as a free agent during the offseason to fill in at shortstop. ... C Gary Sanchez (left shoulder surgery) resumed on-field batting practice and hit several long homers. ... LHP Luis Severino had a couple offseason objectives after struggling the second half of last season. He won 14 of his first 16 decisions, then five of his last 11. ""I changed a little bit of my workout,"" Severino said. ""I think, maybe I got a little bit tired towards the end. My mechanics, I'm not sure, maybe I was tipping some pitches. I want to make sure this year none of that happens."" ... RHP Masahiro Tanaka and RF Aaron Judge joined the early workouts.

25988998,"Sale had put the finishing touches on the World Series by striking out the side in the bottom of the ninth. As enduring as that October run was for Sale and the Red Sox, the seven-time All-Star also said 2018 was the most difficult season of his career.
""Last year kind of stunk,"" Sale said Wednesday as the Red Sox opened spring training.
He was referring to the shoulder inflammation that led to two stints on the injury list in the second half, along with diminished velocity and dominance in the playoffs. After an offseason of rest, Sale is healthy and cleared for a normal spring training. Still, he has a goal for 2019: ""Not missing a quarter of the year like I did last year,"" he said. ""I want to be sprinting across the finish line instead of limping across it.""
Sale wants to make 30-plus starts and pitch 200-plus innings, like he'd done in four of his previous five seasons. While most pitchers would be more than happy with a World Series ring, starting the All-Star Game for a third straight season, going 12-4 with a 2.11 ERA and 237 strikeouts in 158 innings and finishing fourth in the Cy Young vote, Sale didn't like missing time. ""You want to be on the field competing, not inside walls,"" he said.
The Red Sox will be cautious with him in spring training and early in the season, but they were also careful last season, when Sale didn't throw seven innings and 100 pitches until his fifth start in late April. In order to help Sale and the other starters who pitched all those extra innings in October, manager Alex Cora had already announced the Red Sox will begin the season with a six-man rotation.
At the same time, ""we're just not going to overlook 162 games to worry only about the final 11 games of the season,"" Sale said. Indeed, when Sale is going good, it will be difficult for Cora to back off. He had a nine-start stretch last June and July when he allowed five runs in 60 innings with 97 strikeouts while routinely blitzing the upper 90s on the radar.
""With all due respect to [Max] Scherzer and [Jacob] deGrom and all the other horses out there, at one point last season Chris Sale was the best pitcher in baseball,"" Cora reminded everyone. In his seven seasons as a starter, Sale has finished no lower than sixth in the Cy Young voting (although he has never won it). In that span, he's third in WAR among pitchers, behind only Scherzer and Clayton Kershaw. In 2017, he became the first American League pitcher to strike out 300 batters since Pedro Martinez in 1999 and the first AL lefty to do it since Randy Johnson in 1993.
That leads to the other big question surrounding Sale: He's a free agent after the season. While Dave Dombrowski, the team's president of baseball operations, has said Sale and Mookie Betts are both players the club would like to extend, Sale indicated the club has not yet reached out about a contract extension.
Sale did say, however, that he would ""love to"" return to Boston. ""I've said this since my first year here. It's a special organization with a great fan base that demands excellence. ... Plus, we have a hell of a team.""
Sale added that he's not concerned about his contract status. Sale signed a long-term extension early in his career with the White Sox -- following his first season as a starter and second full year in the majors -- so, as he put it, he's always been under contract and not had to worry about that aspect of his career. He feels that's been one reason for his success, so he'll let his agents handle that side of things. ""I'm a baseball player,"" he said. ""I play baseball.""
The slow free-agent market the past two offseasons could conceivably play a factor in how impending free agents like Sale view extensions. Asked about Craig Kimbrel, the Red Sox's closer in 2018, remaining unsigned, Sale said, ""It's crazy to me."" He then said he didn't want to go too much into the politics of the market but did throw out this zinger: ""With half the teams in the league just showing up to collect checks, it doesn't help.""
For now, however, Sale and the Red Sox are focused on going back-to-back. No team has done that since the Yankees won three in a row from 1998 to 2000. Cora pointed out that getting back to a World Series hasn't been quite as hard in recent years -- the Dodgers have gone the past two seasons, the Royals did it in 2014-15, the Phillies in 2008-09. Cora knows the AL East will be tough. He thinks the Red Sox can be better than last year. Having his ace on the mound for 30 starts will be the first step in winning again.

25947017,"Pence, a three-time All-Star, spent the past six-plus seasons with the San Francisco Giants, where he was a key part of World Series-winning teams in 2012 and 2014.
Pence, 35, is a .280 lifetime hitter, with 224 home runs and 877 RBIs in 12 seasons with the Astros and Phillies in addition to his time with the Giants. If added to the 40-man roster, Pence, who played near the Rangers' ballpark in college at Texas-Arlington, would get a one-year contract that pays a $2 million salary while in the major leagues.
""He's got a long track record of being an elite teammate ... a decorated, productive player on the field,"" Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said. ""From a standpoint of pedigree, makeup, and way he goes about the game, it's consistent with the messaging of what we want this team to be about.""
Pence played in just 97 games last season while dealing with a thumb injury, batting .226 with four home runs, 24 RBIs and 59 strikeouts. He played winter ball this offseason.
Davidson, who would get a one-year contract that pays a $1.5 million salary while in the major leagues, is also expected to train this spring for possible pitching duties, the Rangers said. Davidson pitched three times for the White Sox last season, throwing three scoreless innings.
Davidson batted .228 with 20 home runs and 62 RBIs last year, including three homers on opening day at Kansas City. The 27-year-old hit 26 home runs in 2017. He has split his time between third base, first base and designated hitter.

25933117,"""I'm still in awe,"" Smith said after the tour Tuesday, in preparation for his July induction. ""Whenever I sign an autograph and someone says, 'Hey, put Hall of Fame on it,' I don't know if the Hall of Fame goes first or the year goes first.""
Smith, who emerged as an ace reliever with the Chicago Cubs in the 1980s, and former White Sox star Harold Baines were voted into the baseball shrine in December by a select committee. They will be inducted along with Mariano Rivera, the late Roy Halladay, Mike Mussina and Edgar Martinez, who were elected last month by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.
The 61-year-old Smith was at the 2009 Hall of Fame induction of Rickey Henderson, Jim Rice and Joe Gordon. But this time was overwhelming as the monumental aspect of his upcoming enshrinement was still sinking in.
One is a first-ballot lock. The other a last-chance inductee. Here's what Cooperstown's 2019 ninth-inning stars tell us about Hall standards for the position.
Chicago won the day in Las Vegas, as Harold Baines and Lee Smith were chosen for enshrinement in Cooperstown. The Hall of Fame's Today's Game Era Committee selected them at baseball's winter meetings.
Smith appeared on the BBWAA ballot 15 times and never came close.
""It was unbelievable just to get that call. You wait so many years,"" Smith said. ""When I first retired, people told me I was going to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer. I've got goosebumps. I've never been nervous before, but I'm nervous right now.
""It's been crazy,"" he added. ""There's a lot of this stuff here I already knew, especially about the Negro League and guys I played with and against. But being here is like no game you've ever been in before.""
With his menacing stare and hard fastball, Smith was one of baseball's premier closers in the 1980s and 1990s, an imposing 6-foot-5 atop a pitching mound. During an 18-year career, he pitched for eight teams, making his initial mark with the Cubs from 1980 to '87. He also pitched for the Red Sox (1988-90), Cardinals (1990-92), Yankees (1993), Orioles (1994), Angels (1995), Reds (1996) and Expos (1997), and was the all-time saves leader with 478 when he retired in 1997.
A seven-time All-Star, Smith led his league in saves four times and topped the 30-save mark 11 times. Smith held the all-time saves record until Hall of Famer Trevor Hoffman eclipsed it in 2006 and now ranks third behind Rivera (652) and Hoffman (601).
""Everybody recognizes me now because of the Hall of Fame,"" said Smith, a minor league pitching coach with San Francisco. ""Back in the day, I had an identity crisis because in Chicago everybody wanted to throw me on the football field because I was such a big guy. I don't have that problem anymore. Now they know who Lee Smith is. I'm proud of that.""
Smith spent an inquisitive two hours touring the Hall of Fame. While viewing the ""Pride and Passion"" exhibit dedicated to the African-American baseball experience, Smith told a story from his high school days in Louisiana. Soon after the schools were desegregated, he said, an opposing team hung Smith in effigy when his school visited.
With an early lead, Smith said he began hitting batter after batter. He didn't even realize when the other team eventually took the offending image down from a tree.

25947641,"Five-tool players are exceedingly rare in baseball today, especially ones who play a premium position. In J.T. Realmuto, the Philadelphia Phillies are acquiring a five-tool catcher who may be on the verge of superstardom, now that Citizens Bank Park is home.
Realmuto has been suppressed by Marlins Park, which has rated among the five least-friendly ballparks for hitters in each of the past three seasons. The gap between his OPS there and all other ballparks (.205 points) is equivalent to the difference between Mookie Betts' and John Jay's OPS during that time. Excluding all plate appearances taken at Marlins Park in the past three seasons, Realmuto's batting average on balls in play (.363) ranks seventh among 366 qualified hitters.
J.T. Realmuto in Past 3 SeasonsMarlins ParkAll OthersBA.249.318OPS.682.887BABIP<<.291.363>>MLB average: .298 over span

Specifically, Marlins Park is where Realmuto's fly balls have gone to die. In the past three seasons, his slugging percentage on fly balls is 41 percent below the league average there and 17 percent above the league average in all other stadiums. Only 6.5 percent of his fly balls at Marlins Park over the past three seasons found the seats, a figure comparable to the home run rates of Nori Aoki (6.5) and Travis Jankowski (6.3) during that time. But his figure in all other ballparks (15.4) is in line with the rates of Anthony Rizzo (15.7), Adrian Beltre (15.3) and Matt Carpenter (15.3).
An exodus from Marlins Park may turn Realmuto into an elite hitter, but the quality of his defense behind the plate is already among the game's best. He has ranked among the top two in average pop time to second base in each of his past three seasons, according to Statcast.
Realmuto's strong throwing arm is easily identified, but his blocking skills are often overlooked. Over the past three seasons, Realmuto ranks sixth in Baseball Prospectus' blocking runs metric (4.4). The five catchers ahead of him have combined to bat .241 during that time, while Realmuto's .286 average ranks him third among 48 qualified catchers (behind Buster Posey and Wilson Ramos).
Realmuto's reputation as a poor pitch framer proved accurate in his first two full seasons with the Marlins, but that stigma is no longer true. Over the past two seasons, he ranks 22nd among 99 graded catchers in framing runs above average (+5.2).
Over the past three seasons, Yadier Molina is the only catcher with more innings behind the plate than Realmuto (3,159.2). Despite that, Realmuto has not dogged it on the basepaths. He has ranked first among all catchers in average sprint speed in each of the past three seasons, according to Statcast.
Realmuto has parlayed his speed into run-scoring opportunities in a way that most catchers never do. He has ranked above the league average in extra bases taken percentage in each of his four full big league seasons. In 2018 he ranked second (at 67 percent) among 278 players with at least 300 plate appearances (behind Eddie Rosario).
Realmuto has produced 12.9 wins above replacement over the past four seasons, a mark topped only by Posey (17.9) among catchers. FanGraphs estimates Realmuto has been worth $114 million over that span (33rd among position players). With two more years of team-friendly control (he will earn $5.9 million in 2019) before being eligible for free agency (after the 2020 season), he promises to provide extraordinary value and a variance of skills rarely seen at the catcher position.

25961120,"When it comes to the Marlins, many things are a work in progress.
Wearing new uniforms with the rebranded team logo, in a stadium that has gotten spruced up since last season ended, some of the 2019 Miami Marlins gathered for the first time to greet fans and start hyping the new season. Pitchers and catchers report to the team's spring-training home in Jupiter, Florida, on Wednesday.
The Braves' system is still loaded, the Nats are deeper than you might think, the Mets and Phillies have dealt a lot of talent and the Marlins ... are the Marlins.
Of the 25 greatest players in franchise history, Miami has now traded ... wait for it ... 23!
The Marlins fell short of their big demands for their star catcher, but the return could pay off -- if their new No. 1 prospect's arm can hold up.
""I would tell our fans to just give us a chance,"" Marlins president of baseball operations Michael Hill said. ""So many people have written off the Marlins and really haven't taken an opportunity to take a deep look at what we're building. When you have a lot to do, it's going to take time and we understand where we're at. But we've been able to add a tremendous amount of talent over the last 18 months.""
By Hill's count, the Marlins have added 38 prospects and upper-level players since this new regime led by Derek Jeter took over after the 2017 season. That has gone a long way toward restocking a farm system that by Hill's own description was ""barren.""
""We know where we were,"" he said. ""We know where we're going.""
The Marlins won 63 games last season, their ninth consecutive year under the .500 mark and the 15th consecutive time the team missed the postseason -- the second-longest drought in baseball, topped only by Seattle's run of 17 straight seasons without a playoff game. Attendance plummeted to a club record-low 811,104, and the team just traded away its best player, sending catcher J.T. Realmuto to Philadelphia.
""Only one team gets to win the championship every year,"" said right-handed pitcher Dan Straily, who started 56 games for the Marlins over the past two seasons. ""I think every year, with every team in baseball, there's a little bit of excitement for everybody to get going. There's always that hope that this could be the year.""
The Marlins aren't saying if 2019 is their year. Or 2020. Or 2021, for that matter.
They just believe their year is coming.
For Realmuto, the Marlins got catcher Jorge Alfaro and pitching prospects Sixto Sanchez and Will Stewart from the Phillies. Alfaro has above-average power and, the Marlins believe, even a better arm than Realmuto -- whom they considered elite in that capacity. Sanchez has the arm to consistently reach the upper 90s on his fastball, while Stewart doesn't throw as hard but has off-speed offerings that get him out of trouble.
It's deals like that why the Marlins truly believe this rebuild -- one of many by the franchise in the past 15 years -- is the right one.
""They're doing what they said: building the organization from the bottom up,"" Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. ""You keep acquiring talent. You keep marching down that road that gets you to the point where you are competing for a chance to win a world championship every year. That's the plan. That's the goal. I think anything less than that, you don't accept it.""
There was a reason why the grass looked bad Saturday. Monster Jam -- a show where five- or six-ton trucks with 66-inch tires will destroy anything in their path -- is coming to Marlins Park next weekend. It'll chew up the current turf quite nicely. From there, new sod goes down in time for opening day.
""It'll look nothing like it does right now when we come back in six weeks,"" Straily said.
The grass will be exactly what the team wants by then. The Marlins only hope the team is closer to Miami's liking by then as well.

25986579,"CLEARWATER, Fla. -- On the day he found out he was traded, J.T. Realmuto finished lunch, hustled home, loaded his car with pre-packed bags, got in one final workout, said goodbye to his grandparents and started driving. He literally couldn't wait to start his new baseball life.
About 1,300 miles and 17 hours later, Realmuto, his wife, Lexi, and his baby girl, Gracie, arrived here. The next morning, less than two days after that phone call to tell him he was the newest member of the Philadelphia Phillies, Realmuto found his locker and began his first day with perhaps the most interesting team in baseball.
In dealing for baseball's best catcher, Philadelphia boosted its NL East chances while keeping the possibility of an even bigger move on the table.
Of the 25 greatest players in franchise history, Miami has now traded ... wait for it ... 23!
The Marlins fell short of their big demands for their star catcher, but the return could pay off -- if their new No. 1 prospect's arm can hold up.
If they're not that, then the Phillies -- whose winter began with their owner declaring the franchise was willing to spend ""stupid money,"" continued with the acquisition of four front-line talents and marches on with the pursuit of two players seeking the largest contracts in baseball history -- are at the very least in the most interesting division, one made so by something so seemingly novel.
The National League East is replete with teams that want to win. The New York Mets spent the winter remaking themselves through bold, for-the-moment maneuvers. The Washington Nationals by themselves have forked over more money this offseason than half of the teams in baseball combined. The Atlanta Braves return almost the entirety of their division-winning roster, gave Josh Donaldson $23 million for one year and have been in the middle of manifold trade talks this winter, including for Realmuto.
Hello, J.T. Realmuto. From the first day of Phillies camp, their biggest acquisition (thus far) is taking BP and impressing manager Gabe Kapler, who's leaning up against the cage. (h/t producer @FraneyESPN and photographer Jose Collazo) pic.twitter.com/R6pdrXQPpF
Philadelphia, meanwhile, remade its roster through a combination of signings (outfielder Andrew McCutchen for $50 million, reliever David Robertson for $23 million) and trades (shortstop Jean Segura from Seattle, Realmuto from Miami) -- and what makes the Phillies so fascinating isn't just those moves but the one that could complement them. The Phillies, sources told ESPN, remain in pursuit of free agents Bryce Harper and Manny Machado, each of whom continues to seek a $300 million-plus deal. In other words: stupid money.
And while the Phillies' improvements thus far may be enough to hoist them over the Mets, Nationals and Braves, the addition of Harper or Machado would add an entirely new dimension to an already-good team. Their starting pitching, led by Aaron Nola, complemented by Jake Arrieta and awaiting a Nick Pivetta breakout, doesn't match New York's or Washington's but is plenty adequate. Their bullpen, with a full year of Seranthony Dominguez and the addition of Robertson, is better. Their offense, thanks to McCutchen and Segura, gets a boost. And their defense, which was so obscene televised Phillies games last season came with a TV-MA rating, cannot possibly be that awful again.
Harper or Machado would add at least a few marginal wins, and those truly matter for teams in the Phillies' position. Say Harper or Machado is worth three wins above replacement more than the incumbents, which is a reasonable and conservative figure. Three wins is three wins in theory, but the three wins that take a team from 85 to 88, or thereabouts, are worth a lot more than the ones that make a 70-win team a 73-win team. In a division like the NL East (or the NL Central for that matter), those wins may well make up the difference between an October spent chasing a ring and one watching those doing so on TV.
Realmuto said Tuesday that he was excited to join a team with championship aspirations, words not associated with the Phillies since the early 2010s. Those words happen to also be exceedingly reasonable. Without Harper or Machado, the Phillies are good enough to place themselves among the five best teams in the NL, which makes them good enough to claw through a league with no clear juggernauts, which makes them good enough to leverage the short nature of the World Series and emerge from it with some hardware. With Harper or Machado, they're more than good enough. They're the odds-on favorite in the East.
How do the best at each position rank and what tier of production do they fit in?
Positions: First basemen | Third basemen | Outfielders | Starting pitchers
There's a sense in Phillies camp that now is their time, one in which they transition from aspirational to achievers. Nothing would fortify that notion like Harper or Machado doing what Realmuto did Tuesday: slipping on a Phillies jersey.
Harper, in fact, let it be known publicly that the Nationals were making a mistake when the team didn't trade for the catcher before the 2018 deadline. Now Realmuto is with a fierce division rival, and he returned the favor, saying of Harper: ""I would definitely love to have a player like that on this team.""
As the Phillies stare down Harper and Machado, waiting for one to budge, hopeful that spring training's arrival expedites some kind of a deal after 3½ months of soul-sucking inactivity, they do so from a good position: happy about their winter otherwise but ready as ever to make themselves indisputably the most interesting team in baseball.

After a season-ending concussion, the Yankees outfielder just wanted peace and quiet. But his doctor had a very different idea: Turn it up to 11.
New York Yankees reliever Zack Britton announced on social media Thursday that he is changing the spelling of his first name, dropping the ""H"" in favor of a ""K.""
Manny in pinstripes? Bryce in the Bronx? The rumor mill might be telling us otherwise. But Bombers fans like big offseason splashes -- and usually get them.
What isn't justifiable to Steinbrenner is the talk that the team has been cheap this offseason.
""If there's a narrative that we're not spending money and being cheap, it's just false,"" he said. ""I mean, we're well above $200 million [in payroll] -- we're at $220 [million] right now -- and we're well above where we were last year. We did everything we wanted to do to really improve, again, the pitching, because that's where I wanted improvement, because as far as I'm concerned pitching was a big problem in the division series, more so than anything else.""
Speaking at the owners meetings, Steinbrenner would not rule out more moves before Opening Day but sounded as if a deal for a high-priced free agent is unlikely.
""Fans should keep an open mind that I'm never done until I'm done, and that's usually not until Opening Day,"" he said. ""Proposals come to me every day with these guys, between the analytics guys and the pro scouting guys, and I'm going to consider every single one of them.""
New York's offseason moves included re-signing CC Sabathia, Brett Gardner, J.A. Happ and Zack Britton, acquiring James Paxton in a trade, and signing reliever Adam Ottavino and infielders DJ LeMahieu and Troy Tulowitzki.
After New York avoided the luxury tax last year for the first time since it was established in 2003, the contracts with LeMahieu and Ottavino have lifted the Yankees' projected luxury tax payroll to about $220 million, well above the $206 million threshold.
Still, not the splashy moves his father, George Steinbrenner, was famous for.
And although Hal Steinbrenner doesn't listen to sports radio and devour the tabloids, he has kept abreast of the vox populi by nephew Stephen Swindal Jr., assistant director of player development.
New York had the major leagues' top payroll for 15 straight years through 2013 but has not had the top spot since then and was sixth last year. Many fans say because the Yankees have the highest revenue, they should spend the most on players.
""With no discussion of our costs, that's always the problem,"" Steinbrenner said. ""I hear everything about our revenues, I hear nothing about our cost. I hear nothing about the gargantuan debt service payment that we have to pay every year [on bonds that financed new Yankee Stadium], nothing about all of our stadium operations, all the security, not to mention player payroll, not to mention revenue sharing.""
And he keeps in mind the price of keeping Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez, Gleyber Torres and other emerging young stars.
""I have to look at the big picture, and it is my responsibility -- that my family expects, my partners expect -- not just to look at the present but to look at the future, too,"" he said. ""Three, four, five years from now we get a lot of homegrown kids that we love, our fans love, that are going to be coming up for free agency.""
Steinbrenner has said many times he didn't think a team had to spend $200 million to win a championship. New York reached the 2019 threshold by signing Britton, and Steinbrenner gave general manager Brian Cashman authority to keep spending.
""We weren't good enough, so we went out and signed a really good contact hitter in DJ, who can play multiple positions,"" Steinbrenner said. ""And then we went and got Ottavino really to secure a pretty good bullpen, which can certainly help the starting rotation, right?""
New York went 100-62 last year, its best record since its last championship season in 2009, yet finished eight games back of AL East champion Boston. The Yankees beat Oakland in the AL wild-card game, then lost to the Red Sox 3-1 in the division series. Boston went on to win its fourth World Series title in 15 years.
""I think we've definitely got a better club Opening Day than we did opening day last year, particularly in pitching, which is my biggest area of concern,"" Steinbrenner said.
Steinbrenner said ticket sales are about flat, though premium seat sales are down because of the expiration of 10-year contracts that began when their new ballpark opened in 2009. He said talks are ongoing about a potential repurchase of 21st Century Fox's stake in the team's YES Network.
A big move might spark sales. He hasn't ruled that out completely.
""I wouldn't be surprised, because these guys come to me all the time with stuff,"" he said of his staff. ""I can't tell you if 17 days from now they come with some kind of proposal that I say no or I say yes.""
Game notes
Paxton, speaking at the team's minor league complex in Tampa, understands the expectation. ""It's kind of World Series-or-bust for Yankees fans, and I'm excited about having that pressure, and just being on a team that's so committed to winning,"" he said. ... Happ threw a 30-pitch mound session to Sanchez. ... SS Didi Gregorius, recovering from Tommy John surgery, swung a bat one-handed in an indoor cage.

25981608,"Posada will work as a special adviser to Jeter, his longtime New York Yankees teammate and now Marlins CEO, said the person who spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday on condition of anonymity because the hiring has not been formally announced.
Marlins CEO Derek Jeter admits he has ""zero patience"" when it comes to Miami's rebuild and fielding a competitive team.
Like Jeter, Posada spent his entire playing career with the Yankees. Posada has primarily been a South Florida resident since retiring after the 2011 season.
Posada batted .273 with 275 home runs and 1,065 RBIs in parts of 17 seasons with the Yankees. He also was the batter when the Marlins recorded their final out to beat the Yankees in the 2003 World Series, hitting a soft grounder toward first base and being tagged out by pitcher Josh Beckett to end the game and give then-Florida its second championship.
The Marlins have not played a postseason game since.
Jeter is entering his second season as the team's CEO. He inherited a team that had former Yankees star Don Mattingly as its manager, and has since added plenty of other people with Yankees ties -- including vice president of player development Gary Denbo, director of player personnel Dan Greenlee, director of amateur scouting DJ Svihlik and now, Posada.

25902474,"Davidson will be used as an infielder and could pitch as well, giving the Rangers their own two-way weapon.
Free agent right-hander Jason Hammel has agreed to a minor league deal with the Rangers and will report to major league spring training.
The Texas Rangers will use specially designed synthetic playing surface rather than grass in their new retractable-roof stadium that opens in 2020.
Davidson, 27, got off to a hot start with the White Sox in 2018, hitting three home runs on Opening Day and nine total in the first month. But he finished the season with a disappointing 20 long balls to go with just a .228 batting average and 165 strikeouts.
He played the majority of his games last season at designated hitter. The White Sox chose not to tender him a contract, making him a free agent. He also saw time at first base and third.
Davidson has been working pitching into his offseason repertoire, after three scoreless relief appearances last season for Chicago.
""Who knows what could happen?"" Davidson said after one of those outings in 2018. ""The game is changing a little bit. In the next couple of years there might be more two-way players. You're seeing guys getting drafted who are two-way guys. Teams are a little more open to it.""
Davidson was drafted by Arizona in the first round in 2009, then traded to the White Sox in December 2013 for reliever Addison Reed.

25948565,"The 32-year-old would get a one-year contract paying $800,000 in the major leagues if he is added to the 40-man roster. If he is not added to the 40-man roster by March 20, he may request his release within the next day.
Flaherty hit .217 with two homers and 13 RBIs in 182 plate appearances last year for Atlanta. He played for Baltimore from 2012 to 2017.
Cleveland also agreed Thursday to a minor league contract with 34-year-old catcher Dioner Navarro, who has not played in the major leagues since 2016 with Toronto.

The Cubs will be the sixth team for Cedeno, an eight-year veteran who also has pitched for the Houston Astros, Washington Nationals and Tampa Bay Rays.

25972522,"Vogt is returning to the Bay Area, agreeing to a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants.
The catcher shared the news in a text message Monday, when he arrived in the Arizona desert from home in snowy Washington state -- ""14 inches,"" he noted saying Arizona felt great already -- and was headed to the club's spring training complex in Scottsdale, where pitchers and catchers report Wednesday.
San Francisco also agree to a minor league deal last week with catcher Rene Rivera.
""I definitely believe it presents a good opportunity. Obviously Buster, he's the guy. If he's not going to be 100 percent then hopefully we can pick up the slack and hold the fort down until he's ready to go 100 percent,"" Vogt said by phone from Phoenix. ""For me, too, I have to get healthy first as well. I know Rene Rivera is going to play a big part in that as well and I'm excited to work with him. I played against him for a number of years as well. It's going to be fun the three of us talking and putting our heads together.""
New Giants president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi said Friday he was still seeking depth at the catcher position behind Posey, who is recovering from right hip surgery.
Vogt grew up in California's Central Valley, and the Giants were his favorite team. He used to pretend he was Will Clark in the backyard and loved Barry Bonds. Vogt attended the final game at Candlestick Park and the first at the franchise's new waterfront ballpark when it opened in 2000.
""Just getting a chance to talk to Farhan and chat everything out, it was very exciting for me, because not only is it back to the Bay and back where Alyssa and I had our kids and spent a bunch a bunch of years, it was my childhood favorite team, as well,"" Vogt said. ""So growing up a Giants fa,n this is going to be so incredible.""
Vogt and Zaidi knew each other before Zaidi left the A's for the Dodgers, where he spent the past four years as general manager.
The 34-year-old Vogt had surgery on his troublesome right shoulder last May and didn't play for Milwaukee last year. He says he feels great now and is throwing, but throwing from the catcher's crouch remains a step he must complete.
A career .251 hitter with 57 homers and 218 RBI through parts of six major league seasons, Vogt played for Oakland from 2013 through part of '17.

25990915,"""Last year going into spring training, I was struggling,"" the pitcher said Wednesday. ""I was trying to convince myself I was better than I was, but I was doing a poor job of it, I think.""
Wainwright had minor elbow surgery after the 2017 season and was just 2-4 with a 4.46 ERA last year, appearing in only eight regular-season games. His average fastball velocity dropped 1 mph to 89.75 mph, down from 92 mph in 2013, when he went 19-9 and helped the Cardinals reach the World Series.
""I'm excited to play baseball again without having to flinch every time I throw a ball,"" Wainwright said.
Wainwright finished second or third in National League Cy Young Award voting four times in six seasons through 2014. But he is 29-19 since then, averaging 18 starts per year.
Coming off a $97.5 million, five-year contract that paid him $19.5 million last season, the 37-year-old right-hander agreed to a $2 million, one-year contract that allows him to earn $8 million in performance bonuses as a starting pitcher, $3 million for relief appearances and $4 million more for games finished.
Wainwright is scheduled to throw his first bullpen session on Thursday.
He is excited about St. Louis' additions of first baseman Paul Goldschmidt and reliever Andrew Miller.
""When I look at our lineup, and I look at our bullpen and I look at our starting rotation, I don't see many holes,"" Wainwright said.
Cardinals All-Star catcher Yadier Molina loosened his arm and monitored throwing sessions but never put on his shinguards. Molina is recovering from left knee surgery in December and isn't expected to catch bullpen sessions before the start of exhibition games.
""He's able to do everything, it's just a matter of -- listen, it's Day 1 of pitchers and catchers,"" St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said of Molina. ""We don't feel like we need to push him to do anything.""

25952932,"Relievers Ryan Tepera of Toronto and Kyle Barraclough of Washington lost their cases, leaving the sides tied 3-3 with six possible decisions remaining.
After winning last year's hearing, Bauer asked for $13 million and the Indians argued for $11 million on Friday. Arbitrators James Darby, James Oldham and Sylvia Skratek are not expected to rule until next week, after the hearings for Houston's Gerrit Cole and Cincinnati's Alex Wood.
Bauer won a $6,525,000 salary last year in a case decided by arbitrators Andrew Strongin, Steven Wolf and Robert Herzog, who ruled against Cleveland's $5.3 million offer.
The 28-year-old was a first-time All-Star last year and finished sixth in AL Cy Young Award voting after going 12-6 with a 2.21 ERA, second behind Tampa Bay's Nate Snell. Bauer is eligible for free agency after the 2020 season.
Tepera was awarded a $1,525,000 salary rather than his request for $1.8 million. Arbitrators Mark Burstein, Howard Edelman and Edna Francis made the decision after hearing arguments Wednesday.
Barraclough was given a $1,725,000 salary instead of his $2 million request. Arbitrators Jeanne Wood, Wolf and Elizabeth Neumeier heard the case Thursday.
Tepera, a 31-year-old right-hander, was 5-5 with a 3.62 ERA last year. He was on the disabled list between June 27 and July 15 with right elbow inflammation. He earned $574,700 last year and was eligible for arbitration for the first time.
Barraclough, a 28-year-old right-hander, was 1-6 with a 4.20 ERA in 61 games last season for Miami, which traded him to the Nationals last October. He had a $556,500 salary last year and also was arbitration-eligible for the first time.
Nationals outfielder Michael Taylor also lost his case this winter. Houston shortstop Carlos Correa, Oakland closer Blake Treinen and Tampa Bay outfielder Tommy Pham won.
In addition to Cole and Wood, three other pitchers are scheduled for hearings next week: Michael Fulmer of Detroit, Aaron Nola of Philadelphia and Luis Severino of the New York Yankees.

25981518,"During his first meeting with the media at spring training, Ausmus said Ohtani has begun to take some dry swings in the batting cage as he works his way back following Tommy John surgery.
""I'm not going to put a date on it, but we're thinking sometime in May,"" Ausmus said of Ohtani's possible return date.
Ohtani was medically cleared last month to resume full strength training on his right arm following surgery Oct. 1, including beginning weight training, as the right-hander rebuilds strength on his right side. Ohtani is not expected to pitch again until 2020 and his unique status as a two-way player puts his recovery in uncharted waters.
""This is new territory. We're dealing with a guy who DH's on a regular basis and is a starting pitcher,"" Ausmus said. ""It's new territory in rehabbing a Tommy John surgery, and we want to protect him long term being able to do both. If we have to push it back, we'll push it back.""
But the American League Rookie of the Year officially will not be active when the Angels open the regular season in late March, general manager Billy Eppler said last month.
""He'll be doing what he's been medically cleared to do,"" Eppler said, adding that Ohtani will continue to participate in the Angels' spring training camp in Tempe, Arizona, but only in his current rehab program.
Ohtani is attempting to continue his hitting career while resting his pitching arm for the customary length of elbow ligament replacement rehabilitation.
During his dynamic rookie year in the majors, Ohtani batted .285 with 22 homers and 61 RBIs in just 367 plate appearances while going 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA and 63 strikeouts over 10 pitching starts.
In addition to Ohtani, the Angels are working 39-year-old first baseman Albert Pujols back into playing shape after he underwent left knee debridement on Aug. 29.
""Albert is doing everything right now,"" Ausmus said. ""We'll have discussions with him on how he's feeling regularly.""

25969317,"Panama was represented in the tournament for the first time since 1960 only after the Caribbean Professional Baseball Leagues moved the series out of Venezuela because of security concerns shortly before it began. With Panama hosting, the Toros de Herrera were invited to play as a guest.
The only previous Panamanian team to win the tournament was the Carta Vieja Yankees, who did it in 1950 with a roster full of American players.
This win adds to what already has been a big year for Panamanian baseball -- countryman Mariano Rivera became baseball's first unanimous Hall of Fame selection in January. Rivera was in attendance for the first night of the tournament.
Despite winning this year's tournament, it's still uncertain whether Panama will play next year in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Allen Cordona and Elmer Reyes drove in runs in the bottom of the first inning against Freddy Asiel Alvarez and added a run in the seventh on Rodrigo Vigil's hit.
Carlos Benitez produced the Cubans' only run of the game in the fifth inning.
""There are no secrets. I had 29 warriors with a lot of talent and every day they gave me their best,"" Panama manager Manuel Rodriguez said. ""When you play baseball in this way, you are going to get the titles and this win will help the baseball in Panama.""
Javy Guerra, a shortstop in the minor leagues with the San Diego Padres, was named the most valuable player of the tournament.
The Cubans won their last title in 2015 and were looking to add a fourth championship on Panamanian soil, where they were the champions in 1952, 1956 and 1960.

25952980,"Bryce Harper and Manny Machado remain unsigned. As pitchers and catchers begin reporting this week to Arizona and Florida, that remains the big story across the majors, an ugly blot on what otherwise is a cheerful time of the year: The return of baseball.
Still, there are many other spring stories to watch. Here is one for each team ...
To jump to each division, click here: AL East | AL Central | AL West | NL East | NL Central | NL West

Boston Red Sox: Chris Sale's shoulder. Sale clearly wasn't 100 percent at the end of last season, when his velocity was down in the postseason and Alex Cora skipped over him to start David Price on short rest in Game 5 of the World Series. Sale did pitch the final inning of that game (and struck out the side), so maybe all he needed was an offseason of rest. He is entering his walk year as well, which adds to the intrigue.
Level of excitement: 5. Yes, 108 wins and a World Series title will keep the fans enthused -- even if Boston is a football city now.
New York Yankees: Troy Tulowitzki. Can he still play? Does it even matter, considering the Yankees signed DJ LeMahieu and can slide Gleyber Torres over to shortstop and play LeMahieu at second until Didi Gregorius returns? Any value Tulo will provide is basically a bonus, but if he can play, it gives the Yankees more roster flexibility with LeMahieu playing multiple positions.
Level of excitement: 5. Yes, Yankees fans wanted Manny Machado or Bryce Harper. They still have Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Torres, Miguel Andujar, the best bullpen in the game and a rotation that added James Paxton and J.A. Happ (for an entire season) on top of Luis Severino and Masahiro Tanaka.Spring Training 2019Baseball season is almost here! Check out reporting dates and updates for teams in Florida and Arizona.

Baseball season is almost here! Check out reporting dates and updates for teams in Florida and Arizona. Complete coverage »
Tampa Bay Rays: Austin Meadows. The Rays are one of the most fascinating organizations, all the way down to the back fields, where superstud Wander Franco is a must-see. In big league camp, the roster is incredibly deep but lacks a big star on offense (although keep an eye on Tommy Pham, who tore it up after coming over from St. Louis). Meadows, acquired from the Pirates last summer, has always been a top prospect despite numerous injuries. Maybe it all comes together for him in Tampa.
Level of excitement: 5. Go watch this team, Rays fans!
Toronto Blue Jays: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. He might be the story of spring training, as the wunderkind man-child (he doesn't turn 20 until March 16) gears up for his first big league season. Of course, the Jays will hold him down in the minors for 10 days to work on his defense, but Vladdy will immediately start impaling baseballs when he arrives in Toronto.
In dealing for baseball's best catcher, Philadelphia boosted its NL East chances while keeping the possibility of an even bigger move on the table.
We're still waiting for this winter's big free agents to sign, but that didn't stop us from predicting which uniforms they'll be wearing in the Midsummer Classic. Who else makes our star-studded squads?
Days before spring training begins, the offseason's marquee name is adding suitors instead of making his way to camp with a new team. Here's what MLB must do to repair its busted hot stove.
Level of excitement: 3. Outside of Guerrero, the Jays will need comeback years from Marcus Stroman and Aaron Sanchez to generate some excitement on the field.
Baltimore Orioles: The new regime. There is a new general manager in Mike Elias, a Maryland native who comes over from the Astros. The new manager is former Cubs bench coach Brandon Hyde. Unfortunately, most of the players from a 115-loss team are the same.
Level of excitement: 0. In this division, they might lose 115 again.

Cleveland Indians: All the outfielders. Obviously, the big story just broke on Friday with Francisco Lindor's calf injury, but since he apparently will now miss most or all of spring training, let's turn to the outfield -- which, to put in nicely, is a mess. FanGraphs projects in the Indians 29th in left field WAR, 23rd in center field and 27th in right field. The plan is to mix and match, but the Indians really have to hope somebody like Jordan Luplow or rookie Oscar Mercado surprises in camp and proves better than the projections.
Level of excitement: 3. The Indians have the rotation to carry the team to a playoff spot in a weak division, but there isn't a lot of margin for injuries. The inability to address the outfield or bullpen -- while cutting costs -- has left Indians fans frustrated despite three straight division titles.Inside Luke Hagerty's comebackHe's 37 and throwing 99.

Minnesota Twins: Byron Buxton ... and Miguel Sano. They were worth a combined 7.7 WAR in 2017, and the Twins won 85 games and a wild-card berth. They were worth a combined minus-0.8 WAR in 2018, and the Twins dropped to 78-84. They need both to be healthy in 2019 after battling injuries.
Level of excitement: 3. The Twins haven't been completely idle; they signed Nelson Cruz and Jonathan Schoop to no-risk, one-year deals. The Twins, however, still sit about $30 million below last year's payroll and $91 million below the luxury tax threshold with no long-term payroll commitments. They could have played in the Harper/Machado market -- or the second tier -- and elected not to do so.
Detroit Tigers: Miguel Cabrera. Miggy was actually reasonably productive last year -- .299/.395/.448 -- before he ruptured his biceps after 38 games and missed the rest of the season. He had back problems the season before. Even if he's not peak Miggy anymore, the Tigers need a healthy Miggy.
Level of excitement: 1. Cue up those old videos of Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer and Rick Porcello fronting the Tigers' rotation.
Chicago White Sox: Eloy Jimenez. After hitting .337/.384/.577 with 22 home runs across two levels of the minors, Jimenez is ready for the South Side. He has power without striking out much, which will make him an impact hitter from the get-go.
Level of excitement: 2. The White Sox should be better -- it would help if Yoan Moncada figures things out at the plate -- but this goes up only if the White Sox do actually land Machado after trading for his brother-in-law Yonder Alonso and signing buddy Jon Jay.
Kansas City Royals: Kyle Zimmer. Yes, we're digging deep here, but remember Zimmer? He was the fifth overall pick back in the 2012 draft, but he couldn't stay healthy and never reached the majors. The Royals designated him for assignment last spring, re-signed him to a minor league deal and sent him to the Driveline baseball facility outside Seattle. He spent the entire season there, returned to the Royals throwing 94 to 97 mph and now is back on the 40-man roster.
Level of excitement: 2. That's a story to root for, but the Royals are still coming off a 104-loss season.

Houston Astros: The rookie starters. The Astros signed Wade Miley and will move Collin McHugh back to the rotation, but keep an eye on Forrest Whitley and Josh James to also support Verlander and Gerrit Cole. Whitley is Keith Law's top pitching prospect and should be ready to make an impact after a couple of months in Triple-A. We last saw the hard-throwing James pitching out of the bullpen in the postseason (where he cracked 100 mph), and he could win a job out of spring training. Behind those two, you also have Framber Valdez and Cionel Perez.
Level of excitement: 5. We could have mentioned Carlos Correa after his injury-plagued 2018. He was sort of a forgotten dude last year, and you know he is motivated to rebound.ESPN+: Keith Law's prospect rankingsWhich talented stars of tomorrow found a home on this year's list?• Individual players: Just Missed | Top 100: 100-51  | 50-1 | Impact 20• Team rankings: Ranking all 30 farm systems | AL East | AL Central | AL West | NL East | NL Central | NL West

Which talented stars of tomorrow found a home on this year's list?
• Individual players: Just Missed | Top 100: 100-51  | 50-1 | Impact 20
• Team rankings: Ranking all 30 farm systems | AL East | AL Central | AL West | NL East | NL Central | NL West
Oakland Athletics: Jesus Luzardo. The 21-year-old lefty cruised through three levels of the minors last season to become one of the top pitching prospects in the game. If he can make an impact, maybe Oakland's rotation won't be as bad as everyone thinks.
Level of excitement: 3. I mean ... the A's improved 22 games and attendance went up only 1,200 fans a game to 1,573,616 overall. Which isn't nothing, but the A's have drawn 2 million just once 2005. The offseason has been a typical slew of low-budget maneuvers. Hey, it worked last year.
Seattle Mariners: Prospects! It's the last call for Felix Hernandez and, at least for a few weeks, Ichiro Suzuki, but if there's something to watch in spring training, it's the kids the Mariners acquired in the offseason: Justus Sheffield, J.P. Crawford, Justin Dunn, Erik Swanson, Shed Long (with Jarred Kelenic in minor league camp), plus Japanese lefty Yusei Kikuchi. If everything goes right, Kikuchi, Sheffield, Dunn and Swanson will all be in the rotation after the All-Star break. Or maybe that means everything has gone wrong.
Level of excitement: 2. Mariners fans weren't exactly high-fiving each other about Jerry Dipoto trading all his best players (except Mitch Haniger), but the smart understood the reasoning. Make those King Felix nights count; they might be winding down.
Los Angeles Angels: Shohei Ohtani's rehab. All we know at this point: He won't pitch in 2019, and he won't be ready for Opening Day. Beyond that, let's hope for a quick return and 500 plate appearances as designated hitter.
Level of excitement: 3. You can certainly argue the Angels would have been better off bringing in a star player -- imagine a left side of the infield with Machado and Andrelton Simmons -- rather than the piecemeal approach with Matt Harvey, Trevor Cahill, Cody Allen, etc.
Texas Rangers: May your health be with you. The Rangers are taking chances on Drew Smyly (missed the past two seasons), Edinson Volquez (missed last year) and Shelby Miller (16 innings last year). They also signed Lance Lynn. So, this could be a really good rotation if you're replaying a 2015 sim league.
Level of excitement: 2. Who are the Cowboys going to draft?

Atlanta Braves: Ronald Acuna Jr. The Braves signed Josh Donaldson, brought back Brian McCann, and all the young starting pitchers -- both those already in the majors and those close to getting there -- will be compelling, but in an offseason when the Braves declined to swing for the fences, it's all about Acuna. He immediately became one of the most compelling players in the game as a rookie, and after his monster second half -- he was third in the majors in OPS -- there's one question: Can he be MVP?
Level of excitement: 5. Imagine if they had actually signed Harper or traded for J.T. Realmuto, like they should have done.
Washington Nationals: Life without Bryce ... life with Juan. With a return to D.C. looking unlikely for Harper, the Nationals certainly didn't shy away from otherwise improving their roster: $140 million for Patrick Corbin; replacing the dead weight at catcher with Yan Gomes and Kurt Suzuki; signing Anibal Sanchez and Brian Dozier; and adding bullpen pieces in Trevor Rosenthal and Kyle Barraclough. Mostly though, I just want to see Juan Soto hit.
Level of excitement: 4. It's not an election year and the Nationals look good on paper, but there will be some post-Bryce malaise. Win the division and Harper will be yesterday's news.
Philadelphia Phillies: Will they sign Machado or Harper? It's still the big question in Philly, even after the offseason additions of Realmuto, Andrew McCutchen, Jean Segura and David Robertson.
Level of excitement: 4. Philly's a tough crowd, and the fans want Machado or Harper.
New York Mets: All the new faces. The Robinson Cano-Edwin Diaz trade was viewed with mixed emotions from many Mets fans, who apparently viewed Jarred Kelenic as the next Mickey Mantle or something. The Mets also signed Jed Lowrie and Wilson Ramos and acquired Keon Broxton. They're deeper than last year (although another starting pitcher would have been nice) and certainly more interesting.
Level of excitement: 4. New GM Brodie Van Wagenen oozes confidence, and some of it is actually rubbing off on Mets fans.
Miami Marlins: Probably not Neil Walker. In 2017, this train wreck of a franchise had a lineup featuring the 2017 NL MVP, the 2018 NL MVP, plus Realmuto, Marcell Ozuna, Dee Gordon and Justin Bour. Now they have ... umm, Austin Dean, JT Riddle and Peter O'Brien. Not to pick on one player here, but take O'Brien. He apparently is the starting first baseman (although it could end up being Walker or Garrett Cooper), is 28 years old, and while he had an .838 OPS in 74 PAs with the Marlins in 2018, he hit .216 in the minors. He hit .191 in the minors the season before. His strikeout rate during those two seasons was 34 percent -- in the minors. It's going be another long season (although to be fair, the rotation could be almost respectable if everything falls right).
Level of excitement: Negative 1 million.

Milwaukee Brewers: Jimmy Nelson's health. Lots of things going on here, from the battle at second base to Brandon Woodruff and Corbin Burnes potentially moving from the bullpen to the rotation to Christian Yelich's MVP encore. But all eyes will be on Nelson, the team's best starter in 2017 who missed all of 2018 after injuring his shoulder running the bases late in 2017. He recently tweeted, ""I'm in the best place I've been in over the past 17 months"" and that he has never been more excited for spring training.
Level of excitement: 5. They were one win from the World Series last season, and the most underrated baseball city in the country is ready for a big summer.
Chicago Cubs: Yu Darvish's health. The Cubs lost the NL Central tiebreaker game to the Brewers, and there's little doubt that with a healthy Darvish they wouldn't have been in that game in the first place. Darvish suffered a stress reaction in his elbow and made just eight starts, but he already is throwing bullpens in Arizona and said he feels good after a recent 45-pitch session.
Level of excitement: 3. Four straight playoff trips and an average of 97 wins per season, yet 2016 feels so long ago to a crabby group of Cubs fans.
St. Louis Cardinals: Where will Alex Reyes fit? Yes, the Paul Goldschmidt trade should provide a nice boost, and Andrew Miller -- assuming he can avoid the injured list -- will strengthen the bullpen. But it will be curious to see how the onetime uber-prospect looks after missing almost all of two seasons. Even if Reyes starts the season in relief, he has the potential to be the team's No. 1 starter come the playoffs.
Level of excitement: 5. After missing the playoffs three seasons in a row, nothing short of a division title will be enough for Cardinals Nation.
Pittsburgh Pirates: Trevor Williams' sinker. In his second full season, Williams finished 14-10 with a 3.11 ERA, including a remarkable run over his final 13 starts, when he posted a 1.29 ERA and had eight scoreless outings. He doesn't throw hard or rack up the strikeouts, so we'll see if he can repeat his soft-contact success story. If so, maybe the Pirates have a chance of surprising.
Level of excitement: 1. I get the feeling that no fan base is more ticked off these days than Pittsburgh's -- and with good reason after ownership did nothing (again) following an 82-win season while watching other teams in the NL make moves. Attendance was down almost 500,000 in 2018 even though the team was better, and it might decline again. There are ramifications to keeping your money locked up in a bank vault instead of spending it on talent.
Cincinnati Reds: Yasiel Puig and his new friends. Unlike the Pirates, the Reds have had enough with losing, and they made a bunch of ""win-now"" moves, most notably acquiring Puig, Alex Wood and Matt Kemp's contract from the Dodgers. Top prospect Nick Senzel should be ready to make an impact as well. All eyes, however, will be on Puig. There's hardly a bigger contrast in cities than L.A. and Cincinnati, and how he adapts and performs -- will he sulk or play with a chip on his shoulder? -- will be a story to watch all season.
Level of excitement: 3. For the first time in five years, Reds fans are cautiously optimistic, but they know it's a tough division.

Los Angeles Dodgers: Corey Seager and Julio Urias. I know, this is two things, but they're both important! Seager's return from Tommy John surgery is obviously one of the biggest stories in spring training. But I'm fascinated to see if Urias is ready to make a major impact; remember, before his shoulder surgery in 2017, he was arguably the best pitching prospect in baseball. He returned at the end of 2018 and the Dodgers put him on their playoff roster, even though he had pitched only four innings in the regular season. He is still just 22 and could be one of those many rotation pieces for the Dodgers.
Level of excitement: 4. It should be a 5, but Dodgers fans are doing a lot of whining about not signing Harper.
Colorado Rockies: Garrett Hampson. I'm a big fan of Hampson, the speedy infielder who hit .311 across two levels of the minors while swiping 36 bases in 41 attempts. He also has played a few games in center, and with Charlie Blackmon moving to left, Hampson certainly will get some time in the outfield. Frankly, I'd like to see him out there and Ryan McMahon at second (holding down the fort until Brendan Rodgers is ready) and whole lot less of Ian Desmond.
Level of excitement: 4. There are some frayed nerves waiting to see if Nolan Arenado will sign an extension, but after two straight wild-card seasons, Rockies fans should be pumped for 2019.
Arizona Diamondbacks: Who is Merrill Kelly? The D-backs are hoping to pull off a coup with Kelly, similar to what the Cardinals did last year when they plucked Miles Mikolas out of Japan. Kelly, a former Rays farmhand, spent the past four seasons pitching in Korea, and he will get a crack at replacing Patrick Corbin in the rotation.
Level of excitement: 2. The franchise icon is gone. Corbin is gone. A.J. Pollock signed with a division rival. I'd say this will affect attendance, but the Diamondbacks seem to draw 2 million to 2.2 million no matter how good or bad the team plays.
San Francisco Giants: Buster Posey's hip. The six-time All-Star is expected to be ready for Opening Day after hip surgery in August. Posey's power was sapped last season because he couldn't explode through the zone with his swing, so the hope is he returns healthy and hitting .300 again. Even when he was last healthy in 2017, Posey started just 96 games at catcher and 30 at first base, so he's likely going to split even more time between the two positions.
Level of excitement: 2. The Giants are old and bad, and their farm system is weak. But Scottsdale in March is still a great place to go.
San Diego Padres: All the kids. Unfortunately, it has been an offseason of a lot of talk and no action for the Padres. They've been in on Harper and Machado and inquired about Realmuto, but their biggest move was signing Garrett Richards, who might not even pitch in 2019 as he recovers from Tommy John surgery. Still, the Padres should have one of the most intriguing camps because of their top-rated farm system (and Fernando Tatis Jr. in particular), plus already-in-the-majors youngsters such as Franmil Reyes and Franchy Cordero.
Level of excitement: 3. The enthusiasm has been tempered a bit by the lack of a big move, but the Padres are rightfully the most hopeful they've been in years.

25946566,"Frank Robinson, the first African-American manager in Major League Baseball and the only player to win MVP in both leagues, has died at age 83, MLB said Thursday.
An outfielder and first baseman, Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982 in his first year of eligibility.
A fearsome hitter, Robinson ranks 10th on the career home runs list with 586. He won the Triple Crown with the Baltimore Orioles in 1966 and became the first black manager in MLB history in 1975 with the Cleveland Indians.
The late Hall of Famer's talent and competitive fire drove him both as a player and as MLB's first African-American manager.
He also served as MLB's executive vice president of baseball development, with his focus on increasing African-American participation in the sport. He later served as a senior adviser to commissioner Rob Manfred.
""We are deeply saddened by this loss of our friend, colleague and legend, who worked in our game for more than 60 years,"" Manfred said. ""On behalf of Major League Baseball, I send my deepest condolences to Frank's wife Barbara, daughter Nichelle, their entire family and the countless fans who admired this great figure of our National Pastime.""
Robinson was born in Beaumont, Texas, but grew up in Oakland, California, where in his high school he was captain of a state championship basketball team, with Bill Russell -- who would go on to be the first black manager in the NBA -- as his teammate.
Heartbreaking news in the passing of my Dear Friend & @McClymondsHS classmate Frank Robinson. It was my pleasure & great honor to have known him. We all know we lost one of the Greats, what we really lost was a Friend. #RIP @MLB @NBA @BleacherReport @MSNBC @CNN @SFGiants pic.twitter.com/KETXL9MhT8
Robinson won his first MVP in 1961 when he helped lead the Cincinnati Reds to their first pennant in 21 years. He hit .323 with 37 home runs and 124 RBIs and led the majors in slugging (.611), OPS (1.015) and intentional walks (23) for a 93-61 Reds club that lost in the World Series to the New York Yankees.
After a 10-year stay with the Reds that included a 1956 Rookie of the Year award, the 1961 MVP and a Gold Glove, the 30-year-old Robinson was traded by Cincinnati to Baltimore ahead of the 1966 season.
Despite coming off a 33-homer, 113-RBI season in 1965, Robinson was called an ""old 30"" by Reds owner Bill DeWitt and shipped to Baltimore. In return, Cincinnati received pitcher Milt Pappas and two other players -- none of whom came close to the stature of Robinson.
In his first season in Baltimore, Robinson showed he still had plenty left in his 30-year-old body as he was named the AL MVP following a 1966 campaign in which he won baseball's Triple Crown. His MLB-best marks of 49 home runs, 122 RBIs, .316 batting average and 122 runs scored helped carry the Orioles to their first World Series title.
Robinson played five more seasons in Baltimore and finished in the top three of MVP voting twice more before he split time from 1972 to 1974 with the Dodgers, Angels and Indians. After concluding the 1974 season as a member of the Indians, Robinson made history in 1975 as the first African-American to be named manager of a major league club, while he was still playing.
Though paid only an additional $20,000 to handle both jobs, Robinson took the position knowing his place in history.
""They said this was the chance for you to break that barrier,"" Robinson told Outside the Lines in 2016. ""Open the door and to let more African-Americans to have the opportunity to come through it.""
However, Robinson was also aware of the challenges he would face as the league's first African-American manager.
""I knew there was going to be an awful lot of pressure, a lot of expectation and a lot of unhappy people because when things went right, fine, but when things went wrong, it was going to be doubly bad because of me being the first black manager,"" Robinson said.
Robinson retired from playing after the 1976 season, but his managerial career was just beginning.
He remained the Indians' manager for the 1977 season and was honored by the franchise in 2017 with a statue outside of Progressive Field. He also served as manager for three other clubs: the Giants (1981-84), Orioles (1988-91) and Expos/Nationals (2002-2006). Robinson later led the Expos/Nationals franchise through its move from Montreal to Washington.
Robinson was named the AL Manager of the Year with the Orioles in 1989 -- the same year he took part in history by coaching against the Blue Jays' Cito Gaston in the first games featuring two black managers.
Robinson was 1,065-1,176 over his 16 years as a manager, and though he never made the playoffs, he also mentored Dusty Baker and Joe Morgan, who would follow in his footsteps.
Frank Robinson and I were more than baseball buddies. We were friends.Frank was a hard nosed baseball player who did things on the field that people said could never be done.I'm so glad I had the chance to know him all of those years. Baseball will miss a tremendous human being.
While Robinson dealt with racism and segregation during his career and broke barriers as an African-American manager, he said his accomplishments pale in comparison to those of Jackie Robinson. Though the two men were unrelated, they were often mentioned together.
Being the sport's first black manager ""was nothing compared to what Jackie did or what he went through, but it was important because I was the first and that meant the door's open,"" Robinson told OTL in 2016. ""But how long the door would stay open depended on basically the way I conducted myself and the success that I would have.""
When he arrived in Baltimore, Robinson and his family struggled to find housing in the city, with many landlords refusing black tenants. He eventually settled in the Ashburton neighborhood in a house on Cedardale Road.
Six months later, after Robinson won the Triple Crown and led the Orioles to the pennant, the mayor of Baltimore held a ceremony to rename the street ""Robinson Road"" for the duration of the World Series.
The Robinson family asked that in lieu of flowers, contributions in his memory be made to the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis or the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.

25991753,"Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers' president of baseball operations, knows this well.
He basically hears about it every morning.
""You can go to Starbucks and get a coffee and your barista will tell you that you need more pitching,"" Friedman said, smiling. ""Everyone has an opinion, and a strong opinion, which is great, because it speaks to their involvement and how much they care. But I think with that comes a lot of people who want certain things in that moment.""
Rather than sign Harper, the Dodgers picked up A.J. Pollock, a right-handed-hitting center fielder who will bring some much-needed balance to their lineup. Rather than acquire Realmuto, they brought back Russell Martin, the veteran catcher who already has made a positive impression on the pitching staff. Rather than trade for Kluber, the Dodgers acquired Joe Kelly, the former Boston Red Sox flamethrower who brings stability to the back end of their bullpen.
Friedman promised to remain open-minded about additional signings -- and he has plentiful options, given the alarmingly slow-moving free-agent market -- but also sounded like a man who is exceedingly content with the way things stand. Friedman sees ""no weak spot"" on the Dodgers' roster.
""I feel like we have a chance to be an elite team, and I think we have a very well-rounded roster,"" Friedman said Wednesday, shortly after pitchers and catchers conducted their first official workout from Camelback Ranch. ""It's also got a number of core players that have won a significant number of games together. I think oftentimes that gets overlooked.""
The Dodgers are attempting to become only the second team to lose back-to-back World Series and win it in the third year, a feat that has been accomplished only by a 1923 New York Yankees team that featured Babe Ruth.
PECOTA, the projection system used by Baseball Prospectus, has the Dodgers winning 93 games in 2019, at least nine more than any other team in the National League West, which stands as perhaps baseball's least talented division. The Dodgers played like a 102-win team last season, according to their Pythagorean expectation. But the inconsistency in their offense and the struggles in their bullpen limited them to 92 wins and forced them to play a tiebreaker for the NL West title.
""The big thing for us is consistency -- doing everything we can to have our talent come out on a nightly basis, as frequently as we can get it to,"" Friedman said, adding that having more balance in what used to be a lefty-loaded lineup should considerably help that cause.
The Dodgers are counting on Pollock to avoid the fluke injuries that limited him to 237 games over the past three seasons. They're counting on Martin to hit for more power with a tweak to his swing angle. They're counting on shortstop Corey Seager, who's still considered on track for Opening Day, to round back into his All-Star form after Tommy John surgery. They're counting on closer Kenley Jansen, who shed 25 pounds and now will attack spring training more aggressively, to find the life on his cutter. And they're counting on ace Clayton Kershaw, fresh off a $93 million extension, to find some differentiation between his slider and fastball.
Friedman said ""it's always possible"" to take advantage of a slow market and add another free agent, but quickly added: ""I actually really like our team.""
Even if baristas might disagree.
""I think the most important thing for our fans is, 'Are we in a position to win a World Series?'"" Friedman said. ""I feel strongly that we are, and time will tell.""

Chicago has a $5 million team option for 2020 under the deal announced Monday. If the Cubs decline, Brach has a $1.35 million player option with a $100,000 buyout.
The right-hander had 12 saves and a 3.59 ERA in 69 games for Baltimore and Atlanta last season. He posted a 1.52 ERA over 27 appearances following a trade to the Braves.
Brach debuted with San Diego in 2011 and made an All-Star team with Baltimore in 2016. He has a career 3.08 ERA and 33 saves. The Cubs needed bullpen help with closer Brandon Morrow likely missing the start of the season while recovering from elbow surgery.

25987860,"The Philadelphia Phillies and right-handed starting pitcher Aaron Nola are in agreement on a four-year extension, that includes a club option for a fifth season, the team announced. Sources told ESPN that the value of the deal is $45 million.
Nola, 25, was scheduled for an arbitration hearing this week. The deal, which includes a $16 million club option with a $4.25 million buyout, can cover what would have been his first two years in free agency.
""I think Aaron Nola brings a preparation we can all look up to and our other players can emulate,"" Phillies manager Gabe Kapler told reporters Wednesday. ""I think his between-the-lines competitiveness is off the charts. He's such a fighter, he's such a grinder, he's such a battler.""
The catcher couldn't wait to get to spring training, and his new team couldn't wait to have him. Now the question is if an even bigger name will sign on to complete one of MLB's most intriguing makeovers.
Nola is coming off a career-best season -- 17-6 with 224 strikeouts and a 2.37 ERA in 33 starts. He finished third in the National League Cy Young voting behind winner Jacob deGrom of the Mets and Max Scherzer of the Nationals.
Nola will receive a $2 million signing bonus and make $4 million in 2019, $8 million in 2020, $11.75 million in 2021 and $15 million in 2022. He earned $573,000 last season. During arbitration exchange, the Phillies had offered Nola $4.4 million for this season; he was seeking $5.25 million.
""He doesn't want any of the attention, he doesn't want the spotlight on him,"" Kapler said. ""He just wants to compete, compete, compete. That's what he's done and that's why he's one of the two or three best pitches in the National League over the course of the last couple of years.""
Eligible for arbitration for the first time, Nola had asked for a raise from $573,000 to $6.75 million. The Phillies had offered $4.5 million.

25991739,"Wieck, 27, made his MLB debut with the Padres last September, striking out 10 in seven innings while compiling a 1.29 ERA.
A 6-foot-9 lefty, Wieck was working out at Petco Park when he told the team's medical staff during a checkup that he wasn't feeling right, leading to the discovery of a cancerous tumor. Surgery was performed three days later.
""At first it was tough,"" Wieck told reporters, according to The San Diego Union-Tribune. ""I didn't know why it happened. I'm a young kid. Usually you think of that later in life that people get cancer. It's tough to deal with it. But we're dealing with it. All we can do is move forward. There's no reason to sit around pondering why this or why that. It's something we deal with and move on.""
Manager Andy Green said it's reasonable to expect Wieck to be ready for the start of the season. Wieck is playing catch from 105 feet and said he's feeling good and will do as much as the medical staff allows.
""For most of spring training, he's just going to be recovering,"" Green said, according to MLB.com. ""For all of us, we're just glad that he's healthy.""

Wieck said he was grateful to hear from Green, general manager A.J. Preller and two of his coaches, considering he was worried about not just his health, but his future in the sport.

25979272,"Houston Astros ace Justin Verlander isn't buying the theory that the market for big free agents is limited by rebuilding teams not being in position to sign stars.
100 or so free agents left unsigned.  System is broken. They blame ""rebuilding"" but that's BS. You're telling me you couldn't sign Bryce or Manny for 10 years and go from there? Seems like a good place to start a rebuild to me.  26-36 is a great performance window too.
Like last year, the marquee free agents this offseason -- Bryce Harper and Manny Machado -- remain unsigned as spring training approaches. The best hitter of last year's class, J.D. Martinez, didn't sign until Feb. 20, and the top pitcher, Jake Arrieta, didn't come to terms until the middle of March. Players and agents are talking about collusion among ownership, while teams are touting fiscal responsibility. Whatever the reason, free agency has changed, and Verlander isn't the only former MVP saying that the new reality isn't good for the game.
Great news for Phils fans. But shouldn't every team be in a win-right-now mode? What is the point in showing up if you're not trying to win? Thankful for being in an organization that wants to win! pic.twitter.com/GoDYBYXpEJ
Buster Posey's Giants met with Harper recently, but it's not clear if they are able or willing to offer something in the range of the 10-year, $300 million deal that Harper reportedly turned down from the Nationals. Harper and Machado have met with a number of teams, but the sense of urgency that accompanied the courtships of Alex Rodriguez and Albert Pujols has been notably absent.
Teams have instead targeted secondary free agents like A.J. Pollock, Patrick Corbin, Michael Brantley, Yasmani Grandal and Jed Lowrie.
Reigning NL MVP Christian Yelich also weighed in on the Harper/Machado impasse, getting into a back-and-forth with David Samson, his former team president with the Marlins. Samson was fired by Derek Jeter's ownership group in 2017 -- before Yelich was traded to the Brewers -- but he did have a history of shipping out stars for prospects. His exchange with Yelich shows the extent to which the debate over free agency has deteriorated.
Consistent with your anti player rhetoric but adjusting to this ""new reality"" isn't exactly the solution either https://t.co/OT8Z9HpGgH
Martinez was coming off a huge year split between the Tigers and Diamondbacks in 2017, hitting .303 with 45 homers and 104 RBIs. History suggested a long-term, massive contract for the then-29-year-old. The market remained surprisingly quiet, however, and he ended up taking a five-year, $110 million deal from the Red Sox.
Arrieta was two seasons removed from his dominant Cy Young campaign, but he was still seen as a top-of-the-rotation starter heading into free agency. The right-hander reportedly turned down a Cubs offer in the range of what they eventually gave Yu Darvish -- six years, $126 million. He settled for a three-year, $75 million contract from the Phillies.

""There is a certain narrative on us platooning last year, and I think that was kind of for survival,"" manager Dave Roberts said Tuesday during his first spring training availability.
The Padres and Dodgers have bumper crops on the farm and the D-backs and Rockies have help on the way, while the Giants have their work cut out for them.
The two-time NL champions traded Yasiel Puig and Matt Kemp to the Cincinnati Reds and allowed Manny Machado and Yasmani Grandal to leave as free agents. The Dodgers' major addition was to sign Pollock as a free agent.
""I think that we're not as susceptible against left-handed pitching,"" Roberts said. ""Offensively, we're much more balanced, one through eight. Whoever those eight might be on a particular night will conduct consistently better at-bats. And I think the bullpen depth is better than it was last year.""
The recovery of Seager, the 2016 NL Rookie of the Year, is critical.
""He looks really good,"" Roberts said.
Roberts hopes his shortstop, who is throwing at 90 feet, can get 50 to 60 at-bats during spring training.
Beginning his fourth season as manager, Roberts said left-hander Clayton Kershaw would like to regain some velocity. Kershaw's average fastball velocity dropped from 93 mph in 2017 to 91 mph last season, when he dealt with a back injury.
""He feels strong,"" Roberts said.
Closer Kenley Jansen is expected to have a more aggressive spring training routine after surgery Nov. 26 to correct an irregular heartbeat.
""I think with Kenley, it will be more towards '17 spring, and I say that where we were a little bit more active,"" Roberts said. ""Last year with the workload ... we kind of slow-played him and he had a couple little hiccups with the body, and it kind of put him back a little bit. He's in great shape right now.""
Roberts also says he expects reacquired catcher Russell Martin and Austin Barnes to compete for time behind the plate.
""To get a guy like Russell Martin, who's been in the postseason 10, 11 years in his [big league] career, he's a winning player,"" Roberts said. ""He's been a Dodger, he couldn't be happier to come back home, so to kind of pair with Austin I think is a very good duo. And I think that time will tell.

""My father is not involved with the operation of the Chicago Cubs in any way. I am trusted with representing this organization and our fans with a respect for people from all backgrounds. These emails do not reflect the culture we've worked so hard to build at the Chicago Cubs since 2009.""
Major League Baseball, in a statement issued Tuesday, said they were aware of the email exchanges.

""Not only physically -- because he's in a really good place physically, and his body's in good shape, and all the testing that he's doing behind the scenes suggests that he's physically in a really good place -- but I feel like mentally he's ready to go out and in a lot of ways take charge.""
After a season-ending concussion, the Yankees outfielder just wanted peace and quiet. But his doctor had a very different idea: Turn it up to 11.
After experiencing late-season fatigue in each of the last two seasons, Yankees pitcher Luis Severino has changed his diet, is drinking more water and is getting more exercise.
As pitchers and catchers begin reporting to the Yankees' spring-training complex this week, an upbeat and self-proclaimed healthier Greg Bird believes he'll soon get back to being the promising player he once was.
Sanchez, 26, may be in a good place these days, but last summer he often wasn't. A pair of injury-list stints due to groin problems and a nagging shoulder injury that was surgically repaired in November made the season challenging.
To further complicate matters, Sanchez struggled at the plate, hitting just .186 with a .291 on-base percentage. He did have 18 home runs in 89 games, but he wasn't the consistent performer he had been expected to be. Behind the plate, despite appearing in so few games, Sanchez led the majors with 18 passed balls.
""Going through some of the things he went through last year -- I've said this a lot with you guys: Bumps in the road, struggles, especially as a young player, can be great things in the grand scheme of things for a career,"" Boone said. ""Especially when you're as talented as a guy like Gary. Then there's no question that the things he went through last year physically will benefit him going forward.""
Boone can already tell 2018's pains have led to growth.
""The conversations I've had with him, I feel like it's a young player that's another year along, another year mature,"" Boone said.
Ahead of his second season as Yankees manager, Boone took an offseason trip to Sanchez's native Dominican Republic to visit him and his wife, Sahaira. It gave Boone a chance to better connect with the player he's anticipating to be a massive cog in the Yankees' machine this season.
""Getting to go and have dinner with him and his wife in his country, and to just deepen the relationship, and to see him talk passionately about things that matter to him,"" Boone said, ""I just feel like there's been a growth there and a maturity there that comes out when I'm around him and when I talk to him now.
""He's going to have a great year for us on both sides of the ball. I'm really excited about his frame of mind right now, and we're counting on and expecting him to go out and be a great player for us.""

25973809,"There couldn't have been a more fitting backdrop.
Jeter, entering his second full season as CEO of the Miami Marlins, knows that building -- whether it is a new spot for fans to watch games from, or a minor-league system, or a contending big-league club -- takes time. That also means Jeter is being tested in ways now that he never was during his playing days as shortstop for the New York Yankees, when winning and competing for titles seemed like an annual occurrence.
""I have no patience,"" Jeter said. ""I have zero patience. I've been preaching it. I don't have it.""
The Marlins had the worst record in the National League and the fourth-worst record in all of Major League Baseball last season, and just traded away the best player from their 2018 club -- catcher J.T. Realmuto -- to the Philadelphia Phillies. And oddsmakers say the Marlins will be one of the longest shots in baseball this year, which didn't amuse Jeter.
He's clearly not expecting to get his hands on the World Series trophy this year.
That doesn't mean he's accepting another woebegone year as a foregone conclusion, either.
While the Miami Marlins remain a work in progress during their latest rebuild, Michael Hill, the team's president of baseball operations, said Saturday he just wants fans to give the team a chance to show things are headed in the right direction.
Of the 25 greatest players in franchise history, Miami has now traded ... wait for it ... 23!
""Patience is something that you have to learn,"" Jeter said. ""But I'm fine with not being patient. It's like I say: When you're at the major-league level, you're here for a reason, because these players have been better than most other players in this country and in other countries as well. And if you're here, you have an opportunity to win. I can't preach that enough.""
Jeter spent his first season observing and learning, often very quietly. He helped craft a plan that the Marlins say they'll stick to: build an organization from the bottom up, stock what was a badly depleted farm system with prospects, give young players who merit a shot a chance at performing in Miami and hold absolutely everyone accountable.
This season, he's hinting that he may be more involved with players. He learned in 2018. He may teach more in 2019.
""Derek's not going to be patient with not playing the game right, not getting after it every day, not competing,"" said Marlins manager Don Mattingly, who played first base in Jeter's Yankee debut game in 1995. ""He knows where we're at. In a sense you have to have some patience. But you don't have patience if a guy's not playing the game right, if he's not trying to get better every day, if he's not working. That's where he's not going to have patience.""
What he's selling, people are buying.
The Marlins signed Neil Walker late last month to be a veteran utilityman presence, after he spent last year with the Yankees. Even after being with the Marlins for only a couple weeks, Hill said the message from Jeter's office on down is already clear to players: ""You're either going to be on board, or you're out.""
""In talking with Derek, talking with (president of baseball operations) Michael Hill, talking with Donnie, they've really sat down as an organization and thought about where they were, where they presently are and where they hope to go,"" Walker said. ""Their enthusiasm and their vision is contagious. And I know just from early talks with all three of them, they believe in the guys in this locker room and they believe in the direction this organization's going.""
The Marlins vow they're going to make the experience at home games -- where attendance dipped to franchise-record-low numbers in 2018, partially because the team was bad and partially because the new ownership group began revealing far more accurate ticket numbers than was done under the previous regime -- better this year. The team is trying to better embrace the Latin flavor of Miami, and wants fans to even feel comfortable bringing instruments to games if so inclined.
Fans spoke. Jeter says their words were heeded.
""Look, I never shied away from the fact that there's a complicated history here with the fan base,"" Jeter said. ""I get it. We weren't here for that. We're taking over an organization that hadn't had much success at all for the last 15, 16 years. So in order to change that, we had to make changes.""
And if Jeter has his way, the refurbishing of the team won't take long.
""We need to see improvement,"" Jeter said. ""We need to see improvement from some of our younger guys that got an opportunity to play last year. That's how you get better. We can sit and talk about minor-league systems all you want, but it gets to a point when you're in Miami that you have to develop and improve year in and year out. That's how you become a great team.""

25945823,"The Phillies and Marlins have reached a trade that sends All-Star catcher J.T. Realmuto to Philadelphia for catcher Jorge Alfaro, pitching prospects Sixto Sanchez and Will Stewart, and an international bonus slot, the teams announced Thursday.
After months of negotiations with a half-dozen teams for the 27-year-old Realmuto, the Marlins finally dealt him to Philadelphia, which remains a likely destination for one of the two biggest free agents left on the market: Bryce Harper or Manny Machado.
""This is about us acquiring the best catcher in baseball,"" Phillies general manager Matt Klentak said, ""and we're really excited about that.""
In dealing for baseball's best catcher, Philadelphia boosted its NL East chances while keeping the possibility of an even bigger move on the table.
The Marlins fell short of their big demands for their star catcher, but the return could pay off -- if their new No. 1 prospect's arm can hold up.
Of the 25 greatest players in franchise history, Miami has now traded ... wait for it ... 23!
Sanchez is the most well-regarded prospect in the deal, a 6-foot right-hander whose fastball sits in the high 90s and tops out over 100 mph. The 20-year-old missed a majority of the 2018 season with elbow inflammation. Alfaro, 25, is a power-hitting, cannon-armed catcher who will join a young group in Miami. Stewart, 21, excelled in Class A last season, going 8-1 with a 2.06 ERA in 20 starts.
""We did not have to trade J.T.,"" Marlins president of baseball operations Michael Hill said. ""But our goal is to build a long-term sustainable championship organization.""
Philadelphia outlasted pushes by the Cincinnati Reds, San Diego Padres, Atlanta Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers to deal for Realmuto. He is the Phillies' fourth big acquisition of the offseason, following the signings of outfielder Andrew McCutchen and reliever David Robertson, plus a trade for shortstop Jean Segura.
""We're talking about the best catcher in all of baseball, so of course he was popular,"" Hill said.
Regarded by many inside the game as the best catcher in baseball, Realmuto has two years before he hits free agency. He hit .277/.344/.480 in 2018 with the Marlins, who in the past two offseasons have traded him, the last two National League MVPs -- Giancarlo Stanton and Christian Yelich -- as well as outfielder Marcell Ozuna.
""We have heard outstanding things about J.T. and his work ethic and his makeup and his leadership and the type of teammate he is,"" Klentak said.
While the return on the deals for the outfielders last season remains questionable, Miami is hopeful Sanchez and Alfaro can blossom into stars. Sanchez especially has incredible upside, though the list of short, right-handed starters with huge velocity who have succeeded in the major leagues is not long.
""In Sanchez, we saw a front-of-the-rotation starter,"" Hill said. ""Electric stuff -- a pitcher we think can develop and lead a championship rotation.""

25980778,"ESPN and multiple outlets reported earlier Tuesday that deGrom's representatives set the Opening Day deadline and informed the Mets that deGrom would not negotiate a deal during the season.
The full text of a memo sent by veteran agent Jeff Berry to players with ideas for change in light of MLB market conditions.
But Van Wagenen, the Mets' first-year GM and deGrom's former agent, classified the deadline as a ""mutual understanding"" in an exchange with reporters later Tuesday.
""There's no reason for a distraction to carry into the regular season, and we'll continue to have dialogue over the course of this spring and see where those discussions lead,"" Van Wagenen said. ""But the last thing either side wants to do is have this be a distraction once the season starts.""
The Mets' regular-season opener is on March 28 against the Nationals, meaning they have just over six weeks to reach an agreement with the reigning NL Cy Young Award winner.
Van Wagenen said the Mets and deGrom ""continue to have dialogue"" this offseason about an extension but declined to offer specific details of those talks. The sides could possibly resume contract talks next offseason, as deGrom isn't scheduled to become a free agent until after the 2020 season.
CAA agent Jeff Berry, who represents deGrom, released a lengthy memo to all players in late December, calling for union solidarity in adopting a wide range of measures in response to a second straight offseason marked by a slow free-agent market.
Among his many recommendations, Berry suggested that players should potentially limit their individual workloads to maintain maximum value ahead of free agency. The New York Post reported that deGrom could self-impose restrictions on his workload if he doesn't get a new deal from the Mets.
DeGrom, 30, led the majors with a 1.70 ERA last season, going 10-9 with 269 strikeouts in 217 innings. The sides avoided arbitration last month by agreeing to a one-year deal worth $17 million, a record raise for an arbitration-eligible player from his $7.4 million salary. He has one more year of arbitration.
Van Wagenen said Tuesday that he wants to make sure ""there is no strained relationship"" between the Mets and deGrom, ""no matter what takes place.""

25947020,"Major League Baseball will rename the disabled list as the ""injured list,"" the league confirmed Thursday after ESPN broke the news.
The league will make the change out of concern that the term ""disabled"" for injured players falsely conflates disabilities with injuries and an inability to participate in sports. Deputy commissioner Dan Halem said the change was made at the suggestion of advocacy groups for the disabled, including the Link 20 Network.
Jeff Pfeifer, MLB's senior director of league economics and operations, notified clubs of the name change in a memo written in December.
""In recent years, the commissioner has received several inquiries regarding the name of the 'Disabled List,'"" Pfeifer wrote. ""The principal concern is that using the term 'disabled' for players who are injured supports the misconception that people with disabilities are injured and therefore are not able to participate or compete in sports. As a result, Major League Baseball has agreed to change the name 'Disabled List' to be the 'Injured List' at both the major and minor league levels. All standards and requirements for placement, reinstatement, etc., shall remain unchanged. This change, which is only a rebranding of the name itself, is effective immediately.''
The rules of the DL will remain the same. The list has gone through different incarnations since its institution in 1966 and today includes a 10-day version for short-term injuries and a 60-day version for more severe ailments.
MLB and the players' association continue to discuss possible amendments to the usage of the list itself, as a number of teams have been accused of using a shorter DL -- it was changed from 15 days to 10 days in 2017 -- to manipulate their rosters, sources told ESPN.
During recent negotiations with the union, MLB asked to re-establish the 15-day version of the list. The union has expressed interest in 15 days for pitchers -- who are typically the subject of roster manipulation -- and 10 days for position players.
The NBA places injured players on the inactive list, while the NHL and NFL both have injured reserve lists. The NFL also has a physically unable to perform list.
