25759133,"College basketball's highlights over the weekend included buzzer-beaters, major upsets and standout performances.
The weekend was filled with chaos.
On Saturday, four ranked teams lost home games -- three (Iowa State, Mississippi State and North Carolina) of them to unranked opponents.
So, let's dissect What's Real? and What's Fake? in college basketball:
Please stop saying this.
Reddish, one of Duke's elite freshmen, hit the game-winning shot at Florida State on Saturday and suddenly became a candidate for a Disney movie after he helped the Blue Devils secure a signature win with Zion Williamson sidelined by an eye injury in the second half.
C'mon, folks. Reddish is not William Baldwin or Kevin Jonas.
He's a five-star wing who signed with Duke over Kentucky. At the Maui Invitational in November, an NBA exec called Reddish ""the most talented player on the team ... If he would stop bulls****ing."" He's a fluid wing and projected top-10 pick who'd be an All-American candidate had he picked a school that didn't have Williamson and R.J. Barrett.
He's in a difficult spot because he's had to play a complementary role to Williamson and Barrett. That's not easy for a player who is accustomed to being a star. Williamson's eye injury in Saturday's win at Florida State gave Reddish the platform to showcase his potential.
If anything, his performance illustrated how a strong Duke team can become a great squad if Reddish (a 38 percent shooter this season) plays with the same efficiency (5-for-8 from the 3-point line at Florida State) he demonstrated throughout Saturday's win.
When Reddish signed with the Blue Devils, performances like the one he put together on Saturday were the expectation. He's a versatile threat with a bright future at the next level.
Yes, he's been overlooked in the Williamson/Barrett craze. Anyone who knows college basketball, however, was waiting for Reddish to deliver the way he did on Saturday.
He is not some two-star recruit who walked on at Duke and saved Saturday's game. He's just the No. 3 player on a team that might have the top two picks in this summer's NBA draft and another first-round pick named Tre Jones.
Saturday's effort wasn't surprising. Saturday's game was refreshing because Reddish finally put together a performance that showcased his skills.
On Saturday, Vanderbilt had a 16-4 lead at Kentucky in the first half.
The Wildcats had previously been in a similar spot multiple times throughout the season. They were down 29-10 midway through the first half of a 34-point loss to Duke in the Champions Classic. They were down 12-2 in the first half of a win over Texas A&M last week. In a loss to Alabama earlier this month, a two-point Kentucky lead at halftime turned into a six-point deficit two minutes into the second half.
So Saturday's 12-point deficit with 15:07 remaining in the first half against Vanderbilt was a test for this team. Would it collapse or regroup? The Wildcats' ability to outscore the Commodores 24-14 before the break demonstrated a resilience they had lacked during previous lulls.
""We just knew that as long as we stayed focused, don't get out of character, just keep playing defense, we'd get back into the game,"" Keldon Johnson said after the 56-47 win.
Johnson and Ashton Hagans are only 19 years old. John Calipari is still trying to find a formula for a frontcourt that needs Nick Richards and EJ Montgomery to play quality minutes. Tyler Herro can become a consistent and reliable shooter.
There are questions about this Kentucky team that the squad might not answer before the NCAA tournament. But Saturday's early challenges could have led to another loss. The Wildcats got the stops they needed and made the plays they had to en route to a win.
That's a sign of growth.
Texas Tech's defense got exposed by Iowa State, moving the Red Raiders down and moving the Cyclones into the conversation.
No. 2 Michigan (17-0) set a school record for the best start to a season and tied the longest winning streak in program history after an 80-60 victory over Northwestern on Sunday night.
Virginia is outstanding, but let's stop pretending the Cavaliers are different. Plus, Duke has issues on the boards and other hot takes we can prove.
It's never a good idea to doubt a Roy Williams team. But Saturday's loss to Louisville, the worst home loss in the Williams era at North Carolina, magnified some of the concerns about this team. This is still a good squad that will have an edge in most matchups. But this year's Tar Heels aren't the physical, tough Tar Heels we've been accustomed to seeing under Williams.
Louisville kept them from taking advantage of second-chance opportunities and stalled their transition game on Saturday. The Tar Heels are also struggling to defend teams that push the pace and get buckets on fast breaks. Per Synergy Sports, they're ranked 246th in transition defense.
Luke Maye is 4-for-13 from beyond the arc in conference play a year after making 47 percent of his 3-point attempts in ACC action. Coby White is committing turnovers on 22.5 percent of his possessions, per KenPom.com. A team that can beat Gonzaga and North Carolina State on the road is a team that has the potential to compete for a national championship. That's still UNC's ceiling. But North Carolina has been overwhelmed in three lopsided losses to Michigan, Kentucky and Louisville.
Williams' track record suggests he'll fix the challenges.
Right now, however, a turnaround doesn't seem like a guarantee for the Tar Heels.
It's fine to disagree with the opinion of Michigan's head coach, who recently said to a reporter: ""The way Michigan and Michigan State have been playing basketball in these last six or seven years ... it's not different than Duke and North Carolina.""
Let's assume he's referencing the last 5-10 years. Since the 2008-09 season, North Carolina and Duke have won four national titles and appeared in five national title games. Michigan State and Michigan have reached two national title games, both by the Wolverines, and five Final Fours in that span.
National titles are viewed as the ultimate mark of success in college basketball, and a Big Ten team has not won the championship since Michigan State's run in 2000. By that barometer, Beilein's comments seem odd. On a more diverse scale, though, he's on the mark.
Duke hasn't won a regular-season ACC title since 2010. North Carolina has won two of the last three. Michigan (2014) and Michigan State (2018) have won two Big Ten titles in the last four years.
Michigan State and Michigan have nine 26-win seasons combined since 2012-13, and North Carolina and Duke have the same combined number. The Blue Devils and Tar Heels have a significant edge in the number of players they've sent to the NBA.
But Michigan State and Michigan have been two of the best teams in America in recent years -- legitimate powerhouses.
They haven't earned rings recently, but that can't be the lone tool we use to measure a program's status. The 2014-15 Kentucky team didn't win the title and most people believe the Wildcats were America's best team that season. Does anyone believe Connecticut in 2011 and 2014 was actually the best team in America during those years? No.
Beilein is just saying the collective success of Michigan State and Michigan in recent years is comparable to the success of Duke and North Carolina. And, within that stretch, he's right.
Most of the major leagues in college basketball have already identified their frontrunners. But the past weekend's action also elevated potential contenders that could shake up races.
Maryland fans don't want to hear this, but the Terps haven't lost since Dec. 22. And their three losses this season, all to quality teams, came by 11 combined points. In Friday's 78-75 win over Indiana, Maryland's only matchup against the Hoosiers this season, Bruno Fernando finished with 25 points and 13 rebounds, his ninth double-double of the season. Mark Turgeon has a top-15 offense, too.
In the ACC, Louisville made a statement with a convincing, lopsided road win over North Carolina on Saturday. Sure, the Cards face a gauntlet of NCAA tournament teams in league play. But here's the benefit of Chris Mack's upcoming conference schedule: he'll only face Duke (home), Florida State, North Carolina State (home) and Virginia Tech once apiece. Could the Cardinals climb into the ACC's top tier? It's not a crazy thought after the team's win over UNC on Saturday.
Ole Miss is 3-0 in league play after Saturday's win at Mississippi State. Kermit Davis' team has wins over MSU, Auburn and Vanderbilt by an average margin of nearly 10 points. Breein Tyree has made 82 percent of his free throws. And his Ole Miss squad will only play Kentucky and Tennessee one time each this season -- both home games.
In the Big 12, Dean Wade is back for a Kansas State team that won at Iowa State on Saturday and continues to play top-five defense. Oregon State is playing top-10 interior defense in a Pac-12 that's wide open.
Yeah, it's early, but the list of contenders in the Power Five leagues expanded during this weekend's action.
After Tennessee's win at Florida on Saturday, the Vols did the Gator Chomp toward Florida's fans. Some suggested the Vols were classless for making that gesture.
That's just silly. Per Admiral Schofield, Gators fans said things to the Vols that were ""very disrespectful"" and ""inhumane."" He also said the comments weren't just coming from students but from older fans, too.
That's why I thoroughly enjoyed that late-game Gator Chomp. Florida deserved it. It wasn't an egregious act. It was payback. And that has to be an allowable element of college basketball -- it not, we should all just find something else to watch and enjoy.
The Vols hadn't won a game at Florida since the 2011-12 season. So they had a little fun at Florida fans' expense. And that's fine. It's not classless. It's not wrong. It didn't cross any lines. It was within the boundaries of proper postgame celebrations following a win over a rival.
Also, did anyone have sympathy for the opponents that had to endure the Gator Chomp as Billy Donovan's squad won back-to-back titles in 2006 and 2007? What about the Gator Chomps as Florida won behind Mike Miller? Or Jason Williams? Anyone remember those? Were those fans wrong for using that gesture to taunt opponents during games or to gloat after big wins? Because I can't recall any admonishment of overzealous Florida players, coaches or fans who basked in that patented celebration in the school's richest years.
Yeah, Tennessee did the Gator Chomp. And if the team gets the chance, I hope the Vols do it again because that's what makes this game fun and enjoyable.
Chill out, everyone. And let me know when Joakim Noah apologizes for all the times he used the Gator Chomp throughout his career with Florida.

25745682,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- With star forward Zion Williamson out and No. 1 Duke trailing Florida State with 2.8 seconds remaining, coach Mike Krzyzewski drew up a play for one of his other talented freshmen to make.
The Seminoles anticipated it would be R.J. Barrett. But it turned out to be Cam Reddish, left wide open to make the game-winning shot. When the uncontested 3-pointer swished through with 0.8 seconds left, Duke celebrated an 80-78 come-from-behind victory -- one that remained in doubt until the final second.
Duke forward Zion Williamson left the Blue Devils' 80-78 win over Florida State late in the first half Saturday with an eye injury.
For Reddish, it was a redemptive moment after a six-game stretch in which he hit a bit of a shooting slump. But with 23 points and the game-winner on Saturday against the No. 13 Seminoles, Reddish showed not only the world but himself that he knew how to find his way out of it.
""It's a blessing,"" Reddish said. ""I've worked so hard to get here. I was praying like crazy, trying to get back to myself. I'm just glad I was able to make that shot.""
Williamson left the game late in the first half after he got poked in the left eye. After experiencing double vision that did not clear up by the start of the second half, Duke knew it would have to play without him. Florida State took advantage inside with the big-bodied Williamson out, and the Seminoles made it their mission to score easy baskets in the paint.
That strategy worked -- Florida State had seven dunks in the second half and 10 total in the game, the most Duke has given up all season. The Seminoles had their outside game working, too, and so did Duke with Reddish and Barrett leading the way.
Both teams went back and forth in front of a raucous crowd at Florida State, loud enough to draw praise from players and Krzyzewski afterward. The Seminoles took a 78-76 lead with 15 seconds remaining that had the crowd on its feet.
Barrett had a chance to tie the game when he got fouled and went to the line. But he only made one free throw. Phil Cofer got the rebound and tried to knock it out of bounds off a Duke player. But after review, officials said the ball went out of bounds on Florida State, giving the Blue Devils another chance at the win.
The teams traded timeouts, and Krzyzewski said he changed plays before settling on the final option.
""Coach said it,"" Barrett said. ""He said, 'They're going to watch me and Cam's going to be wide open.""
Added guard Tre Jones: ""We knew they'd be trying to not let R.J. get the ball. We're going to him down the stretch. On that last play, we drew it up so R.J. would come off, and if he wasn't open, Cam was right behind him and one of them would be open. Coach drew it up, and the play was wide open and Cam was able to execute.""
Reddish and Barrett were stunned that he was left all alone. So was Florida State guard Trent Forrest, who said simply, ""Somehow, we lost Cam Reddish.""
Said Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton: ""I didn't expect them to get the ball at the elbow; I thought we had that covered. I expected them to get the ball inbounds, but not a direct pass out of bounds to a guy at the elbow. They did a very good job of creating some misdirection. I gotta go back and look at the film and see how he delivered that pass right on the money -- 'cause we had a 7-foot guy right on top of the ball, and I thought that would be enough for them to at least have to go in another direction with that short amount of time on the clock. Great execution by them, and great finish by a very good player.""

Reddish and Barrett combined to score 55 points, tied for their most this season (also combined for 55 vs. Kentucky in the Champions Classic). They combined to go 9-of-15 from behind the arc.
With Williamson out, both players knew exactly what they had to do to lead Duke to the win. And perhaps it was good for them to be able to lead the Blue Devils, with so much of the spotlight going to Williamson this season. But Krzyzewski said It wasn't as if they had something to prove.
""Prove is not the word,"" he said. ""They rose to a different occasion.""
Krzyzewski said that Reddish was fighting cramps the entire second half as well.
""It's a huge game for him,"" Krzyzewski said. ""Whenever a kid hits a game winner like that, it's storybook. Our guys, this is our 15th game. A number of those guys, they've never been in an experience like this -- in this atmosphere, against that level of talent and expertise. And to come up -- it wasn't just that he hit that shot; he hit a couple other big ones. R.J. kept us in it, with Tre making sure we were at least getting the ball to those two guys. But, huge -- huge for Cam.""
Huge for a young Duke team moving forward, too.

25722546,"""Every time I say this, I get emotional about it,"" Leonard Hamilton says quietly.
The Wildcats have advanced to a No. 3 seed in Joe Lunardi's latest bracket. See where your team could be matched up in March.
We asked opposing coaches to spot the missing ingredient in this season's top contenders. Nobody's perfect!
It was a wild week in college basketball, but we know this: The notion that UCLA is aiming too high is fake and that Virginia Tech is a serious ACC threat is real.
It is 1974, and Austin Peay has just put together back-to-back NCAA tournament berths. Head coach Lake Kelly starts to attract attention from other schools across the country. Hamilton, then a 26-year-old assistant on staff and the lead recruiter, decides to see university president Joe Morgan with a pressing question.
Hamilton asks Morgan whether he would be the next head coach at Austin Peay if Kelly leaves. To this day, Hamilton does not know what gave him the audacity to go see Morgan and ask. But that audacity is the reason he is sitting in his Florida State office, retelling the story.
""He looked at me,"" Hamilton recalls. ""He says, 'Leonard, nothing would make me happier than for you to be the head coach at Austin Peay. But I'm retiring in two years, and for you to be the first black head coach in the Ohio Valley Conference -- I don't think I can make that happen.'""
His eyes begin to well up.
""Whew,"" Hamilton says, letting out a deep, heavy sigh. ""Where did I get that from? To think that I'm going to be a head coach at Austin Peay when there were no black head coaches hardly anywhere. But I hadn't even thought about being black. I felt I could get the job done.
""Every time I think about it, it does something to me. That cut my guts out.""
It cut so badly, Hamilton quit coaching. But for a providential phone call from Joe B. Hall at Kentucky, Hamilton could very well be a salesman today in North Carolina. Instead, he built programs into winners at nontraditional basketball outposts, accepting that this was the best avenue for him to take to maximize his impact.
He did it first at Oklahoma State and Miami. For the past 17 seasons, he has done it at Florida State, where he is the school's all-time winningest coach. Going into the No. 13 Seminoles' game against No. 1 Duke on Saturday, Florida State ranks No. 4 in the ACC in wins since the start of the 2005-06 season. Hamilton himself straddles a world uniquely his own: old enough to remember a time when black head coaches were extremely rare, but modern enough to lead an ACC program to the Elite Eight while sending a succession of players to the NBA.
After that Elite Eight run in last year's tournament quieted a growing number of critics in Tallahassee, Hamilton arguably is more relevant today than at any other point in his tenure -- with yet another team poised to make a deep tournament run.
""You're not playing against a team, you're playing against a program, and a program has certain values,"" says Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. ""His teams play together. They're very athletic, and they play outstanding defense, so I would anticipate we would see the same thing we've seen for a number of years from Leonard, because he's an outstanding coach.""
His record says as much. To understand how Hamilton has done it, you first have to understand how his varied experiences shaped him not just as a coach but as a person.
Hamilton grew up in segregated North Carolina, poor, in a family of eight living in a four-room house with no running water, indoor plumbing or air conditioning. ""I didn't live on a street,"" he says. ""I lived on a path between two streets."" His father was a truck driver who moonlighted as a bootlegger to make ends meet. His mother was a domestic worker.
They grew up so close to their church the Hamiltons could hear the piano playing inside their home. Hamilton sang in the choir, and his connection to the church and God remains a central part of his life. He owns a gospel music label and believes a ""hand of protection"" from above has guided him.
He got in trouble growing up, but always found a way out -- especially through sports. In 1969, he became the first black men's basketball player at UT-Martin. When he arrived in Martin, Tennessee, he found the bus had dropped him nearly 2 miles from campus. Armed with a heavy trunk and a large duffel bag, Hamilton would alternate dragging his trunk and bag along the street until he got to the dormitories.
When he met his teammates, he realized some of them had never played with a black player. His coach had never coached a black player. This was nothing new to Hamilton, who used his likability, gregarious personality and exceptional communication skills to endear himself to those around him. His high self-confidence helped, too. He also was a terrific player, known for his tenacious defense. That would soon become a hallmark of his own basketball teams.
""There were seven of us that came in as junior college transfers, and the best way to describe how Leonard handled it is in his second year he was named Mr. UTM, which was unheard of in the late 1960s for an African-American to be accepted like he was,"" says former UTM teammate Rick Leeper. ""His personality gets him past that. Even the ones that had not played with any black athletes had no problem with him at all. Of course, that's the great thing about athletics. We're color blind.""
Hamilton's first plan out of college was to join the Marines. But that changed when he landed a job as a graduate assistant at Austin Peay. That changed again when Kelly lost an assistant and decided to give Hamilton much more responsibility to help fill the void. At the time, Hamilton was married with a young child and had adopted one of his younger brothers to provide a better opportunity than what they had back home.
Hamilton gladly accepted the challenge, realizing this was his chance to prove exactly what he could do. He meticulously organized his schedule, put in long hours and developed a trademark work ethic his players still marvel at today. Soon he found himself on his first trip to New York City, staying up all night talking to the mother of a top recruit after turning the clock in her apartment back several hours to keep the conversation going.
That recruit, Fly Williams, ended up becoming the greatest player in Austin Peay history. But Hamilton had his work cut out for him beyond the recruiting trail. Only a few years older than his players, Hamilton had to approach his job differently than a more veteran assistant did. On top of that, it was the first time many of the players on the team had played for a black coach.
""A lot of us black players, we didn't quite get it early,"" says Howard Jackson, who played for Hamilton at Austin Peay. ""But the example he was setting is what we needed, and we became better people because of the exposure we had with him. He always held us accountable, and he held us accountable as much academically as he did in basketball. In coaching, it's very difficult for some to be honest with the players they're dealing with. He was always honest with me. He told me what I needed to hear, not what I wanted to hear.""
Kelly also served as a guiding force for Hamilton, especially in the way he cared for and treated his players. Jackson was involved in a devastating accident in the summer of 1972 -- his career ended when he fell more than 80 feet through a skylight while working a summer job at a steam plant -- in which he broke both his legs. But Kelly cared for Jackson like a son, allowing him to stay in his home, driving him to class, pushing his wheelchair, taking him to doctor appointments. Hamilton watched with awe and vowed that, whenever he became a head coach, he would treat his players with the care Kelly always showed.
But when would that opportunity come?
In that office with Morgan in 1974, Hamilton felt defeated in a way he never expected. Race had played a role in his entire life, but he always found a way to break through barriers. Hearing those words from Morgan made him think maybe he couldn't break through them all.
He resigned the next day and moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, to work as a salesman for Dow Chemical. But back in Clarksville, Tennessee, Kelly had called then-Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall. ""He told me Hamilton was too good of a coaching prospect to leave something that he had such a good future in,"" Hall said in a phone interview. So Hall called Hamilton for an interview.
Hamilton told him, point blank, ""I'll be loyal to you. Nobody will outwork me, and I won't get you in trouble. But if you're not going to offer me this job, I'm going to go on back to Charlotte, and I want to be the No. 1 chemical salesman in the country.""
Hall offered the job. Hamilton took it and left behind a note on his desk after a week at Dow Chemical that read, ""I resign my position effective immediately. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Leonard Hamilton.""
Whatever hurt he felt, he channeled into purpose. He was the first black assistant at storied Kentucky, a program that had integrated only five years earlier. Coaching here could get him a springboard to a head-coaching job, and in some ways affirmed the work he did at Austin Peay. But it would not be easy, at least at first. Both whites and blacks questioned why he was there -- whites because they were still uncomfortable with a black coach on the bench, blacks because he chose to work at a place that had never much cared for folks their color.
Hamilton did the only thing he knew: He worked, and he worked some more, recruiting high-profile players and excelling as a floor coach. The results would speak for him. Hamilton knew how to talk to people, but he also knew how to get people to trust him. Exacting and tough, but genuine and caring, Hamilton built a reputation as an indispensable part of Hall's staff. ""When I hired him, I got a lot more than I expected,"" Hall says. ""His work ethic is unequaled in the coaching profession. He never wastes a minute. He was that goal-oriented and that clear in his mind, how it would take 100 percent effort to achieve his goals. He never let an opportunity slip.""
Hamilton spent 12 seasons at Kentucky, but head-coaching jobs at major programs remained elusive. In time, Hamilton realized he did not need those jobs to validate his work. Perhaps getting passed over for the Kentucky job in 1985 in favor of Eddie Sutton crystallized that for him.
Hamilton spent his career as the guy who just needed a chance. He had to find a program just like that.
""As a young assistant, I wanted me a great job, I wanted to be in a job where all the players are, but after a period of time, God reached down from heaven to say, you don't need one of those good jobs,"" Hamilton says. ""In order for you to be significant in this basketball world, you need to take jobs that nobody else has been successful at. They're not hiring that many black people in the first place. Why does a good job in a good situation with great potential need you? So I started looking for jobs that had not been successful, jobs that had potential.""
So he went to Oklahoma State in 1986 and took a program with a 37-year NCAA tournament drought back to the tournament. Then he went to Miami, which did not even field a team in the 1970s and most of the 1980s. He won there.
Then he went to the Washington Wizards, signing a five-year, $10 million contract -- more than he'd ever been paid on the collegiate level. He went 19-63 and got fired after one season. Hamilton is reticent to discuss much about that year, saying only, ""I'm appreciative of the opportunity. Things have worked out for the Wizards, and things have worked out for me.""
When he decided to get back into college coaching, Hamilton thought Florida State provided the perfect fit. And for 17 years, he has won there, too, and he shows no signs of letting up at age 70.
""He's had to pave his own way,"" says longtime assistant Stan Jones, who has worked alongside Hamilton for 22 years. ""That allows you to be the ultimate competitor, but it teaches you how to be a genuine professional because you have to connect a lot of dots other people aren't connecting for you. When you apply those lessons and you keep those connections over the course of your career, it allows you to continue to take situations from Oklahoma State to Miami to Florida State and put your stamp on it, where other people can say he just followed this guy, or he got this because of this coaching tree he was under.
""He had to go out and compete for players. He had to compete for respect. He had to compete to show people he's the best at the job he's given. To some people, that motivates. To some people, it intimidates. For him, it's an absolute motivation.""
Hamilton has done it with his relentless recruiting, following up every single phone call and tip he gets on possible prospects. He has done it with buy-in from players, who understand fully the No. 1 expectation is to play solid, tough, relentless defense.
That is especially true playing in conferences such as the Big East and the ACC, with traditional programs that have more advantages than his own. Hamilton has to recruit a specific player to fit his specific scheme, and though he has changed up his offense some over the years to allow for more flexibility and versatility, the commitment to defense is the standard that never changes.
""You can be a kid that can score 30 points, but if you're not going to play defense, you're not playing for him. It's that simple,"" says Alex Fraser, who starred for Hamilton at Miami. ""Coach Ham and his staff believe defense is the benchmark where their teams are going to be.""
Because Hamilton and his staff have great rapport with their players, they have maximized their potential. Hamilton is not a screamer, and he does not get in his players' faces, though he does have a glare that many who do not know Hamilton mischaracterize as anger or harshness. The glare is simply his way of showing his players he is locked in, and he expects them to be locked in the same way.
""Regardless how far they go in March Madness, one characteristic of his teams are the kids respect him and they play hard,"" says Sam Bowie, whom Hamilton recruited to Kentucky in the early 1980s. ""That doesn't mean their shots are going to go in and they're going to win the ACC or they're even going to qualify for the tournament. But when you watch Leonard Hamilton's teams play, they play with discipline, they play hard and they respect their coach.""
Hamilton likes to tell his players, ""The true test is how a man fights through adversity,"" having lived that all his life. And there was no truer test of that than last season, when Florida State coaches truly believed they had a Final Four-caliber team but struggled thanks to various injuries that disrupted their chemistry and production.
The Seminoles went into Selection Sunday on the bubble, and there was some grumbling in town about Hamilton's long-term future -- especially after a disappointing second-round NCAA tournament exit as a No. 3 seed in 2017.
Florida State made it in as a No. 9 seed and pulled one upset after another, making it to the Elite Eight against Michigan before losing 58-54. ""We never stopped believing in ourselves,"" says guard Trent Forrest. ""Once we got there, it was the most focused I've ever seen us. We all had a fear of going home, and we didn't want to get knocked out in the first round. We knew we had a good team that deserved to be in the Final Four or the Elite Eight.""
In the immediate aftermath of the game, Hamilton took heavy criticism for his ""the game was over"" comments, dismissive of a question about failing to foul in the final minutes from CBS sideline reporter Dana Jacobson. He has not spoken much about it publicly beyond a statement in which he offered his apologies and wished he had done better. Jacobson said on Twitter that Hamilton was ""nothing but professional with me,"" noting that he answered the question rather than walking away.
Hamilton allowed his emotions in the moment to swallow him. It was the closest a Hamilton-coached team had ever gotten to the Final Four.
Expectations skyrocketed headed into this season with a veteran group returning. But Phil Cofer got hurt in the preseason and is just working his way back into form, and Terance Mann has a heel injury that hampered him in a loss to Virginia last week. Facing Duke is always tough, but the level of difficulty is even higher for any team not at full strength.
Hamilton will manage his players the way he always does. No matter what happens, he will be the same person in the locker room he always is, dispensing words of wisdom or perhaps some measure of inspiration. The goal will remain the same.
""Showing people our run last year wasn't just a fluke, that we're back and hungry again,"" Mann says.
That comes from the top, starting with a man all too eager to keep pressing forward, to keep proving, over and over again, he can win.
""We don't stand on a ladder saying, 'We're No. 3!'"" Hamilton says. ""If you don't have the determination to want to be No. 1 ...""
He pauses.
""That's the fun part. It's what keeps you motivated.""
"
25700679,"Jayhawks coach Bill Self said in a statement that X-rays taken after Friday's practice did not show the severity of the injury. The MRI exam revealed the tendon tear, which is similar to a torn tendon Azubuike had in his opposite hand in December 2016 that sidelined him the remainder of his freshman season.
""The surgery date will be set early this week,"" Self said. ""The doctors expect a complete recovery and Udoka will be able to resume full basketball activities at some point this summer.""
The injury is a significant blow to the Jayhawks' interior depth, not to mention their national title aspirations. The nation's preseason No. 1 already has been playing without sophomore forward Silvio De Sousa, whose eligibility remains in question after his name surfaced in the FBI probe into apparel company adidas.
Self said recently that there has been no change in De Sousa's status.
The Jayhawks (12-2, 1-1) lost 77-60 to Iowa State on Saturday in their first game without their bruising center from Nigeria. But that was a byproduct of 24 turnovers and some patchy work on defense rather than any issues in the paint, where Kansas had a dominant plus-15 advantage on the boards.
""We've been living on the razor's edge a lot,"" Self said. ""Granted, we don't have a lot of where we can go to guarantee us having a great possession. We really don't have good ball-handlers right now.""
Azubuike had been rounding into the sure thing before his injury.
After missing time earlier this season with a sprained ankle, he had been on a tear the past couple of games. He had 23 points and nine boards in a blowout of Eastern Michigan, then had eight points and nine more rebounds in a comfortable win over No. 23 Oklahoma to begin defense of the Jayhawks' Big 12 title.
The only other true center on the Kansas roster is relatively raw freshman David McCormack, which means Self could be forced to use smaller lineups again. He prefers to run with two big men but has leaned on four-guard lineups the past couple of seasons because of the configuration of his roster.
The starting lineup Self used Saturday featured Dedric Lawson in the post, with Marcus Garrett joining starters Lagerald Vick, Quentin Grimes and Devon Dotson in a four-guard backcourt.
Whether that sticks when Kansas returns to the floor against TCU on Wednesday night remains to be seen.
""We've got a lot of stuff we've got to hammer out,"" Self said, ""and hopefully we can do it relatively soon. .... There's no question, eventually you're going to play like you practice. So certainly, we've got to be better in practice, I think, and that will probably translate to better performances in the games.""

25787413,"De Sousa, a 6-foot-9 power forward from Angola, has not played this season while the NCAA reviews his eligibility.
""Silvio has cooperated fully and completely with the investigation of his NCAA eligibility, which has now caused him to miss over half of his sophomore season,"" Scott Tompsett of Tompsett Collegiate Sports Law said in a statement. ""Silvio came to the United States from Angola at the age of 15, and he did everything he was supposed to do and was asked to do to become an eligible student-athlete at the University of Kansas. Silvio followed the rules. He did nothing wrong.
""If adults did something illicit or against the rules, they did it without Silvio's knowledge or involvement. Their actions and conduct can be dealt with through the courts and/or the NCAA major infractions process. It's time for the NCAA to be fair to Silvio and immediately reinstate his eligibility.""
De Sousa has been held out of competition since October, when former Adidas consultant T.J. Gassnola testified in federal court that he paid $2,500 to De Sousa's guardian, Fenny Falmagne.
""The University of Kansas continues to work with the NCAA staff to resolve issues concerning Silvio's eligibility,"" Kansas athletic director Jeff Long said in a prepared statement. ""The process is ongoing, and we will continue to work closely with the NCAA staff. Our commitment to integrity and to the process is unwavering.
""While the past several months have been difficult for this young man, Silvio continues to work hard in the classroom and in practice and he has been an exemplary teammate. His patience and cooperation throughout this process have been admirable and we look forward to a resolution.""
De Sousa graduated early from IMG Academy in December 2017 and enrolled at Kansas for the spring semester last season. He made his debut Jan. 13, 2018, and appeared in 20 games for the Jayhawks.

Jones was injured Monday night in an overtime loss to Syracuse after crashing into Frank Howard while both went after a loose ball. Jones was in obvious pain, and Duke announced afterward he would be out indefinitely.
Though Jones is unlikely to play against No. 4 Virginia on Saturday, the freshman has not been ruled out just yet because his shoulder has responded well to treatment. Top-ranked Duke (14-2, 3-1 ACC) considers him day-to-day.
""I don't know if it's for this game or the next game, but it's not going to be long term, where it's a month or something,'' Krzyzewski told The Athletic. ""He's going to be back.''

Last week, Bland pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery and admitted he accepted $4,100 to steer players. He is scheduled for sentencing April 2, though he likely won't be jailed and will serve his sentence through probation.
Evans is accused of accepting at least $22,000 in bribe money while coaching at South Carolina and Oklahoma State.
Richardson, who is facing 18 to 24 months in prison, is accused of taking at least $20,000.
""Throughout his career in basketball, Book Richardson has been a net positive to the game,"" Richardson's attorney, Craig Mordock, told ESPN in a statement. ""Through his encouragement and dedication, he has affected the lives of many who have had successful careers in and out of basketball. He accepts that he was wrong in this case. His actions with respect to the matter are something he did, not who he is.""
It wasn't immediately known if Evans accepted a plea deal or will go to trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in April. His attorney, Billy Martin, didn't immediately respond to inquiries.
Sources told ESPN that the defendants had until Monday to accept the plea deals.
Two other defendants indicted in the federal case -- former Adidas consultant Merl Code and Christian Dawkins, a runner for former NBA agent Andy Miller -- are preparing to go to trial in April.
""None of this changes our approach,"" said Steven Haney, Dawkins' attorney. ""Our level of fight is not going to change because of what other people do.

25760236,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- Duke remained firmly entrenched at No. 1 for a fourth straight week in The Associated Press men's college basketball poll, which was enough to give its Hall of Fame coach another record.
First-place votes in parentheses
The Blue Devils led an unchanged top 10 in Monday's AP Top 25 and spent their sixth week on top this season. That gave coach Mike Krzyzewski his 122nd week at No. 1 in the AP poll, breaking a tie with the late UCLA coach John Wooden for the most in poll history.
Duke had set a program record for most weeks at No. 1 in the AP poll in November, also by passing UCLA.
The Blue Devils stayed at No. 1 after Atlantic Coast Conference road wins at Wake Forest and Florida State, the latter coming on a last-second 3-pointer by freshman Cam Reddish. Duke received 36 of 64 first-place votes entering a week that will see the Blue Devils host No. 4 Virginia in a marquee league matchup between ACC favorites.
THE TOP TIER
Behind Duke, second-ranked and unbeaten Michigan earned nine first-place votes, third-ranked Tennessee had 13 and Virginia -- the only other unbeaten team -- had the remaining six. That quartet is significantly ahead of the rest of the field, with the gap between the Cavaliers and No. 5 Gonzaga (158 points) being bigger than that between Duke and Virginia (85 points).
Michigan State, Kansas, Texas Tech, Virginia Tech and Nevada rounded out the rest of the top 10 for a second straight week.
RISING
The changes started from there after a week that saw 12 of the 15 teams outside the top 10 lose at least once, with five of those losing twice, and combining for 17 losses.
Five teams rose in the new poll, starting with FSU climbing two spots to No. 11 despite the loss to Duke. No. 12 Kentucky was next, joining No. 15 Marquette as the week's biggest climbers by rising six spots.
No. 16 Buffalo and No. 20 Oklahoma (which lost to Texas Tech last week) each rose three spots.
SLIDING
Six teams fell in this week's poll, most notably No. 24 Mississippi State. The Bulldogs lost to South Carolina and Mississippi last week, then fell 10 spots for the biggest slide among ranked teams in this week's poll.
No. 21 Houston fell four spots after suffering its first loss of the season, which came against Temple. No. 14 Auburn and No. 25 Indiana each fell three spots, No. 17 North Carolina State slid two and No. 13 North Carolina fell one after winning on the road against the Wolfpack, followed by suffering its worst home loss under coach Roy Williams, which came against Louisville.
THE NEWCOMERS
Mississippi had a big week by beating Auburn before its victory over Mississippi State. That was enough to get the Rebels back into the poll at No. 18, the program's first ranking since spending two weeks in the AP Top 25 in January 2013. Pretty good for a team that didn't receive a single vote from the panel only a week earlier.
Three teams -- No. 19 Maryland, No. 22 Villanova and No. 23 Iowa -- returned to the poll after appearances earlier this season.
FALLING OUT
Ohio State (No. 16), Iowa State (No. 20), St. John's (No. 24) and TCU (No. 25) fell out of the rankings after each lost twice last week.

25717739,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- Zion Williamson missed a dunk against Wake Forest on Tuesday night, but he did just about everything else in another dominant Duke win.
Freshman sensation Zion Williamson scored a season-high 30 points with 10 rebounds, and No. 1 Duke won its first road game of the season by beating Wake Forest 87-65 on Tuesday night.
Vince Carter says he can relate to Duke phenom Zion Williamson and believes the freshman has a bright future in the NBA.
Here's where the top prospects are projected to land.
The star Blue Devils freshman has made his share of headlines this season with highlight-reel dunks, but he said after Duke's 87-65 win that he's glad he got to show off the rest of his skill set.
""I kind of hate being classified as a dunker,"" Williamson said. ""Coach [Mike Krzyzewski] wouldn't have recruited me if I was just a dunker. But I guess people on the outside don't understand that. I can't play to impress other people. I'm playing to get better for myself and my teammates and hopefully make a run for a national championship.""
Williamson made his case against the Demon Deacons. His 30 points were a career high, and it marked the 11th 25-point game by a Duke freshman this season -- tying the Blue Devils' total from last season, according to ESPN Stats & Information.
But in addition to the scoring, Williamson had 10 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 steals and a blocked shot, while dominating the paint on both ends of the court.
Williamson also sank three 3-pointers, nearly matching his season total of four entering play.
Zion Williamson describes people thinking of him only as a dunker and focuses on getting better as a player.
""Coach is always telling me to shoot the ball, but if it's not falling, then I'm not going to,"" said Williamson, who air-balled his first shot from 3. ""But after I shot that one over the rim, they were like, 'Z, shoot another one,' and I got it right back and made it. I think my confidence from 3 is getting a lot better.""
The shot might still be something of a work in progress, but after the game, Wake Forest coach Danny Manning offered ample praise for the guy who just stomped his team, comparing Williamson to former Demon Deacons great Rodney Rodgers.
""That size, the athleticism, he's a really well-put-together young man,"" Manning said.
Krzyzewski said he had encouraged Williamson to expand his game, including the shots from 3.
""I have confidence in him doing everything,"" Krzyzewski said. ""If I don't, there's something wrong with me. He's a complete player.""
How complete? According to ESPN Stats & Info, Williamson is the only Division I player in the past 20 years to post a line with 30 points, 10 boards, 5 assists, 4 steals and 80 percent shooting from the field. Ben Simmons, who went on to become the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft, is the only other Division I freshman to post a 30-10-5-4 line.
Williamson laughed about the final stat line, suggesting even he was a bit surprised by the complete performance, but guard Tre Jones said this was the type of performance the team has been used to seeing behind the scenes.
""I see that every day in practice,"" Jones said. ""We know what he's capable of. He draws more than one defender every time he attacks, and he's able to find open guys. You guys were able to see that tonight.""

25738521,"Michigan State said Ganakas died Friday.
""Gus was one of the most selfless and positive people that I've ever been around,"" current Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Ganakas family as they grieve their loss.""
Ganakas became an assistant coach at Michigan State in 1966. After taking over as head coach three years later, he went 89-84 in seven seasons. Jud Heathcote succeeded him and coached the Spartans to a national title in 1979, with Magic Johnson leading the way.
""You'll learn all you need to about Gus when you look at the way he handled being replaced as head coach,"" Izzo said in a statement. ""Most of us would have wanted our replacement to fail, hoping it would make us look good. But that wasn't who Gus was. Instead, he made sure that the local high school superstar Earvin Johnson knew that Michigan State was still the right place for him to attend and that new coach Jud Heathcote was the right guy to play for. As they say, the rest is history.""
Ganakas was an assistant athletic director from 1976 to '98 and an aide to Izzo from 1998 to 2000. He also spent over 30 years as one of the voices of Michigan State men's basketball, serving as a color commentator.
""For 20 seasons we were broadcast partners -- a partnership that would turn into one of the greatest friendships of my life,"" said Will Tieman, play-by-play announcer from 1992 to '96 and since 2002. ""You couldn't help but love Gus. He was truly one of the greats of the greatest generation.""
Born in Mount Morris, New York, Ganakas earned his bachelor's degree in physical education from Michigan State in 1949 and a master's degree in the same field in 1950. He went to Michigan State after serving in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II.
Before becoming an assistant basketball coach, Ganakas was the coordinator for the Ralph Young Fund, known today as the Spartan Fund. In 2017, the Michigan State MVP award as voted on by the players was named in his honor.
""Gus has helped build the family atmosphere within Michigan State basketball,"" Izzo said. ""The connection between our past and our present is the best of any program in the nation because of Gus. Former Spartans from all eras feel connected to the current team, and much of that credit goes to Gus.""

Bryan Trimble Jr. started in place of Ponds, who watched quietly from the bench in sweat pants and a red polo shirt.
""Anytime you take your best player off the team, it has an effect,'' coach Chris Mullin said. ""I thought we played OK. A little passive, I thought.''
Mullin said Ponds is day-to-day.
""We've just got to play through,'' the coach added.
The school said Ponds initially was injured at Georgetown on Jan. 5, when he scored 37 points during an overtime victory. He played through the problem and had 23 points Tuesday night in a 76-71 loss at defending national champion Villanova.
Ponds had started all 16 games this season. St. John's went 1-2 without him last season.
St. John's (14-3, 2-3 Big East) dropped its second straight game since moving into the AP Top 25 for the first time in four years.

25720714,"Steve Alford got fired on his day off. Kansas just lost the most important big man in the Big 12 to a season-ending injury. Gonzaga reintroduced Geno Crandall and Killian Tillie, both of whom had missed extensive time due to injuries. Nevada lost for the first time all season -- to New Mexico, by 27 points. And Michigan State's Josh Langford missed his second game due to an ankle injury that might sideline him for a lengthy stretch.
Drama, no? Which is why it's important to separate what's real and what's fake amid the drama.
The Big 12 title streak is over for Kansas
Don't do this, America. Trust me on this one. I've done it too much.
I am the former chairman of the ""KU's Streak Will End This Season"" club. And every season I spent in that role, I was eventually proved wrong. Now, it's easy to see why the doubts are strong after the school announced Sunday that Udoka Azubuike will miss the rest of the season with a hand injury -- two years after a hand injury cost him the second half of his freshman season.
They're not the same team without him; at the very least, there's a significant void in the paint. Saturday's 17-point loss at Iowa State proved as much. They're one of America's best offensive teams (46.3 percent from beyond the arc, per hooplens.com) and one of the country's most impressive defensive teams (Azubuike averaged 1.6 blocks per game) when he's available.
Without him? They go from dominating like Michael Jordan's Dream Team in 1992 to struggling like Carlos Boozer's Dream Team in 2004. (Yes, Boozer played on a Dream Team.)
That's a problem. Iowa State, clearly, is a real contender. And Texas Tech is the college basketball equivalent of Clemson football's defense (which, as we know, just shut out Alabama in the second half of the title game). I can't remember the last time the Jayhawks looked this vulnerable.
Oh wait -- yes I can: last year, when they were 8-4 after 12 games in conference play. Or was it when they were 5-3 after eight games in 2015-16? Or maybe it was when Kansas had an 11-4 record with three Big 12 games to play and Buddy Hield's Oklahoma squad coming for their crown?
In every aforementioned case, the streak continued.
They. Have. Won. Every. Big. 12. Title. Since. The. 2004-05. Season.
That streak precedes the iPhone. I was carrying one of those old 37-pound laptops around campus and listening to Ludacris in 2004-05. A bunch of Jayhawks players were in preschool when the streak started. Think about that. I'm not sure how Bill Self will extend his Big 12 title streak, which stands at 14 consecutive championships, outright or shared. But I will not do what I've done in the past and assume the streak is over. He has Quentin Grimes and Devon Dotson, the key pieces of a top-10 recruiting class. He has Lagerald Vick and Dedric Lawson, a pair of players who could earn first-team All-Big 12 honors. And he has Allen Fieldhouse, where he has lost just 13 games since the 2003-04 season.
It's too early to make any assumptions about KU's reign potentially coming to an end. The smarter play is to assume Self will tinker with his lineup and find a way to win No. 15.
UCLA is aiming too high
No, we're not talking about the ridiculous Rick Pitino rumors.
Since Alford was fired by UCLA last week, there have been rumblings that the key issue with the Bruins might not be the coach but the program's expectations. I disagree with that notion.
Going forward, UCLA can't offer $2.6 million per year and expect to attract a top candidate, whether that's Fred Hoiberg or an elite college coach. But the Bruins still have one of the strongest brands in college basketball. In 2016, the school signed a $280 million deal with Under Armour.
Although Alford struggled throughout his tenure, he recruited seven first-round picks and multiple top-10 recruiting classes. In 2019, UCLA remains an attractive option for the best high school players in America. So what's wrong with a school with that name, that talent potential and that legacy not being content with mediocrity?
I don't think the Bruins will ever dominate basketball the way they once did under John Wooden. But the supporters of that program don't expect that. They're not naive. They're also not going to cheer for a team that can't win Pac-12 titles or make a run in the NCAA tournament. Those around the program want a new coach who can build, in time, a contender. That's a reasonable expectation at a school like UCLA.
The ranking of St. John's
Somehow, Chris Mullin's team started the week ranked No. 24 in the Associated Press poll -- three spots behind a Marquette team it beat by 20 points last week. St. John's only loss came on the road against Seton Hall and it was marked by late-game officiating chaos.
No guarantees this will continue through Big East play. But St. John's entered the week playing top-25 offense, by far the best production under Mullin. It's a Big East contender that deserved a higher ranking.
Houston chasing an undefeated regular season
On Saturday, New Mexico handed Nevada its first loss of the season. But the Wolf Pack weren't the only team chasing an undefeated regular season.
Kelvin Sampson's Houston team is 15-0, including a 2-0 start in the American Athletic Conference. Wichita State and Cincinnati battled for the conference title last season. But they're not as strong as they were a year ago. That could help Houston's cause.
The Cougars are playing top-15 defense and they've held opponents under 44 percent inside the 3-point line this season. They're not a great 3-point shooting team (33.2 percent), but Armoni Brooks, Corey Davis Jr. and Galen Robinson Jr., their top three scorers, can all hit those shots. Plus, only three teams (SMU, UCF and Cincinnati) are ranked within the top 50 in adjusted offensive efficiency on KenPom.com.
But all of this could look ridiculous soon. Houston has played 13 of 15 games at home. Beginning with a matchup at Temple on Wednesday, the Cougars will play four of their next six games on the road. If Houston can preserve its undefeated résumé after that stretch, an undefeated regular season will become a more realistic possibility.
Virginia Tech is a serious threat in the ACC 
The ACC is tough. Virginia and Duke look like Final Four teams. Florida State, North Carolina and NC State are all NCAA tournament squads, it seems.
But Virginia Tech's tremendous start has been overlooked.
Virginia Tech has made 44.2 percent of its 3-pointers while playing top-40 defense. And Nickeil Alexander-Walker (18.8 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 3.4 APG, 2.4 SPG, 47.2 percent from the 3-point line) is a projected first-round pick who has quietly launched an All-America campaign. All of this early success -- the Hokies have one loss, at Penn State on Nov. 27 -- is even more impressive with Chris Clarke (suspension), the team's leading rebounder last season, and top-100 recruit Landers Nolley (NCAA clearance issues) sidelined for the year.
They've been a disciplined defensive team that's limited opponents' free throw attempts and protected the rim as well as any Virginia Tech team under Buzz Williams.
All positive signs for the ACC's most compelling sleeper.
Antoine Davis is doing crazy things 
Want another reason to get ESPN+? How about a bunch of chances to watch Detroit's Antoine Davis, who is honestly just here to get buckets. He's averaging 27.3 PPG, the No. 2 mark in America entering the week. But that doesn't tell the full story. He scored 33 points against Northern Kentucky on Saturday. He dropped 48 points on Wright State last week. That was his third 40-point performance of the year, the top mark against Division I opponents, per ESPN Stats & Information.
He's made 86 percent of his free throws and 41 percent of his 3-pointers.
He's only 6-foot-1. Yes, Detroit is struggling at 6-10, but who cares? Davis is undefeated.

25733011,"According to ESPN Stats & Information, it tied for the sixth-largest final-minute comeback in Division I history. Texas A&M's 12-point comeback to beat Northern Iowa in the 2016 NCAA tournament remains the biggest deficit overcome with less than a minute remaining.
The visiting Bruins had a chance to win the game in regulation, after Oregon fouled Jaylen Hands in the final seconds to protect its three-point lead. Hands made the first free throw and missed the second on purpose, but UCLA's Chris Smith picked up the loose ball and laid it in to tie the game while getting fouled. He missed the potential winning free throw.
The Ducks led by as many as 17 points in the final seven minutes, and also had a 13-point lead with 2 minutes, 30 seconds remaining. A Prince Ali 3-pointer with 2:21 remaining ignited a 21-8 run to tie the game.
Oregon made just four of its final 21 attempts from the field.
UCLA is now 3-0 since firing head coach Steve Alford and promoting assistant coach Murry Bartow as the interim replacement; the Bruins are 10-6 overall and 3-0 in the Pac-12. Oregon, the preseason Pac-12 favorite, dropped to 0-2 in the league and 9-6 overall after Thursday's loss.

Ty Jerome and De'Andre Hunter are future pros. Kyle Guy has made 48 percent of his 3-pointers. Virginia looks ferocious, and a win over the Hokies would extend the momentum for a program that has put the loss to No. 16 seed UMBC in the NCAA tournament behind it.
Everything points toward a lopsided victory for Virginia. The Tigers, who've played top-25 defense, have lost two in a row. They're coming off a Sweet 16 run, and they've fallen short of expectations. They're desperate. They'll put up a fight.
Northwestern at No. 2 Michigan (7:30 p.m. ET, Sunday, Big Ten Network)
Entering the week, the Wolverines boasted one of America's best defenses, an offense that rarely commits turnovers and a terrifying lineup that features three athletic, 6-foot-6ish wings (Jordan Poole, Ignas Brazdeikis and Charles Matthews).
Michigan, which reached the national title game last season, is a more versatile team this season. A Jan. 19 road trip to Madison to face Wisconsin could help the Wolverines maintain their spot atop the Big Ten's standings. But they can't look past Northwestern. Yes, the Wildcats are 1-4 in Big Ten play, but they lost two of those games (Michigan and Indiana) by a combined four points. In a 62-60 loss to Michigan on Dec. 4, Vic Law and Dererk Pardon combined to score 39 points. Plus, Northwestern committed only nine turnovers and made 50 percent of its shots inside the arc.
Michigan will probably win. But John Beilein won't overlook the Wildcats.
Kansas State at No. 20 Iowa State (12 p.m. ET, Saturday, ESPN2)
Entering the season, Iowa State's matchup at Baylor looked like a trap game between matchups against Kansas and Kansas State, which was coming off an Elite Eight run. But Kansas State has suffered from Dean Wade's injury. So this becomes the trap game for a Cyclones team that will face Texas Tech in Lubbock on Wednesday.
Iowa State has to develop a consistent efficiency throughout the season to compete for the Big 12 title, which is still Kansas' crown to lose. An Iowa State team that beat Kansas by 17 points last week but couldn't beat Makai Mason and Baylor this week, knows it can't look ahead.
Kansas State launched the greatest comeback in school history with a 21-point come-from-behind win against West Virginia on Wednesday night. The Wildcats don't have Wade, but they continue to play top-10 defense. So this could be a game that puts Iowa State back on the winning path or a game that leads to a three-game losing streak (if it loses at Texas Tech next week) and diminishes its shot at a Big 12 title.
No. 8 Texas Tech at Texas (2 p.m. ET, Saturday, Longhorn Network)
Texas Tech's defense has been tremendous this season. No team in America has been better. And Jarrett Culver (19.0 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 3.9 APG, 40 percent from the 3-point line) is a projected first-round pick.
But Texas has amassed just a 5-5 record since a win over North Carolina in late November. The Longhorns made 46 percent of its 3-pointers in that game, far off its season average (32 percent). They did show their potential, though.
Could Kerwin Roach lead a Texas team that also has played top-10-level defense to a win over Texas Tech before the latter prepares for a game against Iowa State that could impact the pecking order in the Big 12? Anything can happen in college basketball.
No. 1 Duke at No. 13 Florida State (2 p.m. ET, Saturday, ESPN)
With Trent Forrest, Terance Mann, M.J. Walker and PJ Savoy, Florida State has a collection of big wings who won't face significant problems with Duke's size. Plus, Mfiondu Kabengele (6-foot-10) and Christ Koumadje (7-foot-4) can limit the action around the basket.
Virginia made 44 percent of its 3-point attempts in a win over Florida State last weekend, but the Cavaliers made only 39 percent of their shots inside the arc. Could a talented Duke team that has made only 32 percent of its 3-pointers be forced into taking more shots from beyond the arc against Florida State?
We'll see. It's Duke's second true road game of the season, and Leonard Hamilton's squad has forced turnovers on nearly one-quarter of its opponents' possessions.
It could make for an interesting ACC matchup -- or another sign that Florida State is just not in the same class as Virginia and Duke.
No. 7 Kansas at Baylor (4 p.m. ET, Saturday, ESPN)
The Udoka Azubuike injury changed Kansas. But Wednesday's win over TCU showcased Bill Self's depth and ability to adjust -- his greatest trait in his run of 14 consecutive Big 12 titles.
Dedric Lawson (31 points, 14 rebounds, three steals) was unstoppable. It was an emotional effort and a rebound from a lopsided loss to Iowa State.
Still, Kansas has not proven it can be a great team without Azubuike.
And Makai Mason and Baylor just knocked off Iowa State. Perhaps the Bears think Kansas is vulnerable in a post-Azubuike world. But the Jayhawks, until proven otherwise, remain the team to beat in the league. A dominant win over a team like Baylor would solidify that.

""He was suspended for conduct issues,"" Enfield said, according to a report by the Los Angeles Times. ""We'll reevaluate his future with the program this week.""
Porter said in a statement released Monday that speculation that he won't finish the season with the Trojans is false.

Porter scored five points in 25 minutes in USC's 79-74 overtime loss to Oregon State on Thursday after missing seven consecutive games due to a thigh injury. He arrived at USC as ESPN's No. 40-ranked overall prospect in the class of 2018 and was the top-ranked player from the state of Washington.
Porter scored at least 12 points in each of the first five games of the season but has missed nine of the 11 games since, registering just 29 minutes over the two appearances.
Teammate Jordan Usher was also suspended earlier this season, which led him to transfer to Georgia Tech.
""We've had a lot of distractions this season for a variety of reasons,"" Enfield said. ""The last thing you need is a team that's trying to put together some wins in the Pac-12 to have more distractions.""
Usher, from Canton, Georgia, averaged 8.6 points and 3.7 rebounds in 12 games, including two starts. He averaged 4.8 points and 2.0 rebounds as a freshman in 2017-18.

25716448,"Atlanta Hawks veteran Vince Carter knows what it's like to be defined by a highlight reel and says he can relate to Duke freshman Zion Williamson.
Duke freshman Zion Williamson showed Tuesday he is more than just a great dunker, as he scored 30 points to go along with 10 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 steals and a blocked shot in a rout of Wake Forest.
There's no denying RJ Barrett's natural talent, but we may also have to give partial credit to Vince Carter's between-the-legs 2000 dunk for the Canadian prodigy.
Once nicknamed ""Vinsanity,"" the 41-year-old Carter starred at North Carolina in the mid-1990s and is a former NBA slam dunk champion. Picked fifth overall in the 1998 draft after his junior season, Carter said he had to prove he was more than just a gifted athlete upon entering the NBA and thinks Williamson will succeed in doing so, as well.
""He'll be ready [for the NBA],"" Carter, the 2000 NBA slam dunk contest champion and eight-time All-Star, told ESPN. ""One thing I learned when I got in this league is that yes, I'm athletic, but there's gonna be a lot of guys up here that are athletic. What else do you bring to the table? I think he's going through that phase, kind of what I went through. Everybody looks at 'he can dunk, he can dunk,' but now when you have guys that are super athletic, then they're going to start saying, 'What else can he do?'""

Williamson, who has created this season's most impressive highlight reel, has been the face of college basketball since his arrival and is a contender for this year's Wooden Award.
He is considered a skilled and multidimensional prospect who can guard multiple positions, and Carter believes Williamson possesses the tools to handle the next level.
""He's super, super athletic,"" said Carter, who ranks seventh in the NBA all-time in made 3-pointers. ""He has an NBA body already. I think, more than anything, with all his ability, I just say take his time, develop his game, because when you get here, it's a different beast as far as expectations. A lot of guys try to get here and just develop while they get here.""
Williamson entered Tuesday's night's win at Wake Forest averaging 20.2 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.9 blocks and 2.1 steals this season for the top-ranked Blue Devils.
He is projected to be the No. 1 overall pick in ESPN's mock draft, a prediction Carter agrees with.
""He has the potential to be, obviously, the No. 1 pick whenever he decides to come out,"" Carter said. ""I think that's understood.""

Sherfield, a 6-foot-3, 185-pound senior at Sunrise Christian Academy in Bel Aire, Kansas, starred the past two years at North Crowley High in Fort Worth, Texas, his hometown. He averaged 24.1 points, 4.2 assists and 3.6 rebounds per game last year while leading North Crowley to a 31-6 record.

25707107,"DURHAM, N.C. -- North Carolina and Duke have always had a tense rivalry. But if the Blue Devils win a national championship this season, they might owe a former Tar Heels star some of the credit for their spoils -- because the paths of Vince Carter, the longtime NBA standout and former UNC star, and RJ Barrett, Duke's freshman phenom, are connected.
Barrett, whose 22.9 points per game leads all Duke players, is the face of a generation of Canadian players who grew up revering Carter, a former Toronto Raptors superstar who is now a reserve with the Atlanta Hawks. Carter's between-the-legs slam at the 2000 NBA dunk contest -- four months before Barrett was born -- remains one of the all-time highlights of the event, which also featured then-teammate Tracy McGrady.
""Vince and Tracy McGrady, they more inspired us taller, long, athletic guys,"" Barrett told ESPN. ""OK, [Carter] is one of the best players in the league. 'Why can't I be that too? I look just like him.' That's where Andrew Wiggins comes from. And then just other guys following his footsteps.""
The country's basketball fascination started before the Raptors arrived in 1995. But Carter's arrival as an exciting American hero, drafted in 1998, introduced Canadian basketball fans to a SportsCenter-worthy star who influenced youngsters in a country where one-fifth of the population consists of immigrants who may be more likely to embrace basketball and soccer over hockey, the nation's pastime. (A 2014 study by a Toronto-based research firm showed that basketball is the second-most popular sport behind soccer for youths ages 3-17 born outside of Canada.)
""I can recall walking down the streets of Toronto and you wouldn't see a kid dribbling a basketball as we would see in the United States, and that's a normal thing and you probably think nothing of it,"" Carter said. ""And then years, two to three years later, particularly after that [2000] dunk contest, now you start seeing kids walking around with basketballs in their hands, dribbling a basketball. You start to see more basketball courts popping up around the city, more guys going to play pickup basketball, just the whole nine.""
Before 2000, eight Canadians had been selected in the NBA draft. Since 2000, 19 Canadians have been drafted -- eight of them lottery picks. Four Canadians -- Barrett, Gonzaga's Brandon Clarke, Arizona State's Luguentz Dort and Virginia Tech's Nickeil Alexander-Walker -- are projected first-round picks in ESPN's latest mock draft.
Here's where the top prospects are projected to land.
Other Canadians are lighting up the courts, too, and could lead their teams to league titles and NCAA tournament runs. Iggy Brazdeikis is Michigan's leading scorer. Oshae Brissett is averaging nearly a double-double at Syracuse. Lindell Wigginton and Marial Shayok are key players for an Iowa State team chasing an at-large berth and a Big 12 title.
It's Barrett, though, who has elevated the nation's global profile, a profile enlarged by predecessors like his godfather, two-time NBA MVP Steve Nash; the Denver Nuggets' Jamal Murray, currently averaging 18.4 PPG; and Wiggins, who just reached 7,000 points in the NBA.
Last summer, Barrett led Canada's Under-19 squad to a gold medal in the world championships, the country's first in a FIBA event. He's also the starting shooting guard on a men's national team aiming for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
""I don't know if anyone saw it coming to this level,"" one former NBA executive said of Canada's rise. ""It kind of exploded.""
And on Tuesday, Carter will return to the place it all began for him in a road game against the Raptors -- the same night Barrett's Blue Devils play at Wake Forest (7 p.m. ET, ESPN).
""Vince Carter has, without a shadow of a doubt, been the most important, influential and transcending basketball player our country has ever seen,"" said Peter Yannopoulos, a former UMass assistant and a TV and radio analyst in Canada. ""We are witnessing before our eyes the golden generation of Canadian basketball. Several have played an integral role, Steve Nash being a prominent one, but Vince is the reason our AAU teams started winning tournaments in the United States and why we have produced so many lottery and No. 1 overall NBA draft picks. Carter gave everyone the swag and confidence to rep not only Toronto, but all of Canada.""
At a recent shootaround with his younger Hawks teammates, Carter didn't look his age -- 41, as a reminder -- as he took part in 3-point shooting drills.

""I've been fortunate to be around some good people,"" said rookie Trae Young, who credits the veteran with guiding him through his first pro season.
""Air Canada"" has influenced a multitude of players as one of a handful of candidates filling a void created when the stars of the 1990s retired -- and as the bridge between Canada's two eras of basketball.
In 1891, Canadian James Naismith invented the game of basketball while teaching at a YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts. But his role in the game's history did not interrupt his country's immense love for hockey. That's not surprising, considering Canada's men's hockey team won six of the first seven gold medals at the Winter Olympics, between 1920 and 1952, and three of the past five. Beginning with the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Canada's women's hockey team won four consecutive gold medals.
So, entering the 1990s, Naismith's sport had a lot of ground to cover to attract a fraction of the attention hockey had enjoyed in Canada.
Basketball was growing in popularity that decade, though. Damon Stoudamire, the 1995-96 rookie of the year, led the Raptors before Carter was drafted. The Vancouver Grizzlies had arrived with the Raptors during the 1995-96 season. Bill Wennington (Montreal) won three NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls in the mid-'90s, and Rick Fox (Toronto) won three rings with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in Los Angeles a few years later.
Still, Canada was a country that had emphasized its winter sports over budding activities like basketball. The government devotes millions of dollars to Olympic sports through a program called Own The Podium, launched more than a decade ago. As recently as the 2016 Olympics, the program gave $2.2 million for men's basketball but $5.8 million to its (gold-medal-winning) curling teams.
Since the 1990s, though, cities like Toronto have become melting pots for immigrants, many from the Caribbean and Africa -- and many of whom have come to embrace basketball. Perhaps Ontario-native Barrett -- whose father, Rowan, is the son of Jamaican immigrants -- would have likely emerged as a preeminent talent with or without Carter's arrival.
The genetics are there. Barrett's mother, Kesha, ran track at St. John's and his aunt Dahlia Duhaney won a gold medal in the 4x100 relay with Jamaica in the 1991 world track and field championships. His father averaged 10.4 PPG as a senior at St. John's and played on the international circuit for more than a decade. Rowan also played with Nash, then an NBA All-Star, on Canada's national team, which finished seventh at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
Canada's 2000 Olympics run coincided with the exploding popularity of Carter and the Raptors. Rowan retired in 2008, when RJ was 8 years old, and became the executive vice president and assistant general manager of Canada Basketball, the country's national program.
In his effort to find and develop the best talent in Canada, he created the Junior Academy in 2012, an operation that aims to identify and unify the top young players in the country. RJ joined Michigan's Brazdeikis and others in the program, which has access to a world-class training facility.
""We had them in the seventh grade, playing in [The Junior Academy], teaching them how to play, all of that, best on best,"" said Rowan, who also played with Carter during a brief stretch in training camp with the Raptors in the former All-Star's rookie season. ""When I was coming up, I think I first came into the [national] program at 18, 19. Before you knew it, you were in college. The structure has grown. It's all year round, training athletes, ready if somebody needs something. ... We didn't really have that. It was [a] meet up every summer thing. There's much more funding and structure in place now to support the growth of Canadian athletes.""
So RJ has been able to reap the benefits of more structured basketball and his father's own connection to the national level. When RJ was 12, Nash put him through rigorous workouts while the national team practiced on the other end of the court. Nash, who bought RJ's first crib when he was a baby, never hesitated when Rowan asked him to be his son's godfather. As teenagers, they'd become friends through their shared nationality, their love for basketball and their common interests.
""Steve is a better person than he was a basketball player,"" Rowan said.
They both loved Jamaican food, and Rowan admired Nash's ""hip vibe"" (he was fond of baggy shorts). The 6-foot-3 Nash also downplayed his NBA success. He never took his first-class seat when he played with the national team, instead granting the luxury to his larger teammates.
It all set the stage for RJ to emerge as a potential torchbearer for the next wave of Canadian basketball.
At 15, he led Canada to a silver medal in the Under-16 FIBA world championships. He spent his teenage years embarrassing players in American grassroots tournaments and international FIBA events on his way to becoming the No. 1 prospect in the 2018 class.
But some who tried to ignite programs struggled to find the cash to match the growing interest.
 ""I was trying to get the fans, the kids, the parents, the coaches, all the corporate world, the media to see that there was a lot of potential to go with this basketball thing because we had a lot of kids who were from the Caribbean, from Africa, from Europe, from South America, also from the U.S.,"" said Ro Russell, who founded his Grassroots Elite program more than 20 years ago. He said he couldn't get any sponsors.
Some tied to the game believe race played a role in the distribution of resources.
""We've had the talent but we've never had the opportunity,"" said Mike George, an agent who represents Murray, Dillon Brooks and other NBA standouts. ""Back in the day, weren't too many brothas playing on the national team. Now obviously, you see the dynamics. It's more of a representation of what our country is. I think we've always had the talent level but we weren't able to get those guys. Now there's no real bias as to where a kid comes from.""
All agree that Carter and the Raptors motivated a diverse generation of young athletes to dream of NBA futures and a new day for Canadian basketball's global status.
A Raptors team in the bottom half of attendance at the inception of the franchise enjoyed top-10 numbers in Carter's best years, which included two playoff runs in 2000 and 2001. Players such as the Miami Heat's Kelly Olynyk and Cleveland Cavaliers big man Tristan Thompson, both Canadians, attended Carter's camps in Toronto.
New grassroots programs emerged. Parents hired professional trainers for their hoops-hungry kids. Team Canada invested in programs that aimed to identify prodigies scattered throughout the country. Prep schools popped up and strengthened the brand. Milwaukee Bucks big man Thon Maker and Murray, the Nuggets' rising star, played at Orangeville Prep near Toronto.
""That was the special thing,"" Carter said. ""I for sure didn't realize until later on, like, 'Wow.' We were able to change the game and the way hockey kids thought. Yes, we know the Toronto Maple Leafs. They're the kings. We just wanted to be respected. But it took on a life of its own.""
Russell, the AAU coach who couldn't find private money to run his program, found plenty of sponsors (and players) as the Raptors became Canadian icons. He credits Carter.
""He had corporate people saying, 'There's a product I think we can endorse,'"" Russell said. ""Vince created the buzz that basketball is an exciting sport.""
But not necessarily one Canada could use to attain global acclaim.
Canada's men's basketball team has not won a medal since 1936, and it has not qualified for the Olympics since 2000. But Leo Rautins, former coach of the men's national team and a TV analyst for the Raptors, said those connected to the sport in Canada could sense the emergence of a new generation of talent.
And that's why Barrett's freshman -- and likely only -- season at Duke involves implications that go beyond his personal ambitions.
Over the past 20 years, the Canadian basketball machine has tried to mold a player who could become something more than a contributor at the next level and lead the next wave of young talent, just as Carter did after he was drafted by the Raptors.
Murray has superstar potential. He entered the week as the No. 2 scorer for Denver, the top team in the Western Conference. Wiggins, a career 33 percent 3-point shooter, is a flawed offensive specimen. Thompson is averaging a double-double but he hasn't lived up to the five-year, $82 million contract he signed in 2015. Anthony Bennett, the No. 1 pick in the 2013 NBA draft, is largely viewed as a bust after he averaged 4.4 PPG in a four-year NBA career. Cory Joseph and other Canadians have found comfortable roles (and lucrative deals) in the NBA.
Barrett could surpass them all.
""He's definitely the next one,"" said Rautins, a Toronto native and a first-round pick in the 1983 NBA draft. ""You just look at his class. Iggy Brazdeikis at Michigan. Simisola Shittu at Vanderbilt. You just keep going. He's like 'the one,' but there's a whole bunch coming. And if you look at what Jamal Murray's doing, and Andrew Wiggins is still putting up great numbers. ... RJ's one who certainly has the potential. Not only does he have the talent, he has the motor. He doesn't want to just beat you, he wants to take your lunch on the way out.""
During an intrasquad scrimmage in October, Barrett led his team against Zion Williamson's squad.
A few minutes into the contest, Barrett cut through the lane and scored. He flexed his biceps. He screamed. He crumpled his face like a discarded wad of paper. In that game, much like the other collegiate matchups he has played in thus far, the 6-7 versatile threat did whatever he wanted to do.
Those who've tracked his career have come to understand that look as a sign the Canadian prodigy has switched into takeover mode. Through his aggressive performances, he has entered the midway point of the 2018-19 season as a Wooden Award contender.
""I would say he's a dog in all aspects,"" said Cam Reddish, Barrett's teammate at Duke. ""On the court, he's just a dog nonstop.""
Mike Krzyzewski paused for a moment in his office as he pondered a question about Barrett: Had he ever had a freshman as polished as Barrett?
""I'm trying to think of anybody,"" he said. ""Not really at this time for a freshman. I don't think there's anybody.""
Krzyzewski continued, ""Kyrie [Irving] would have been. Kyrie would have been there. Because he had it. Kyrie would be. Again, they're different and then Kyrie got hurt [at the start of the 2010-11 season]. Kyrie, I would put [next to Barrett] as far as being way ahead.""
Some critique Barrett for his willingness to attack in the moment. In the final seconds of a loss to Gonzaga in the Maui Invitational in November, he missed a pair of late shots. Some accused him of being selfish.
Folks at the next level did not see it that way. An 18-year-old freshman had just brought his team back from a double-digit deficit against a team that could win the national title.
He had no fear, even though Gonzaga's Clarke and Rui Hachimura, two projected first-round picks, were waiting in the lane. Barrett didn't care.
And the numbers prove Duke -- and any other team he's on -- is better when he has the ball in his hands. Duke averages 121 points per 100 possessions and makes 57.2 percent of its shots inside the arc and 40.5 percent of its 3-pointers when Barrett is on the floor, according to hooplens.com. He has made 66 percent of his shots in transition, per Synergy Sports.
He's not a great 3-point shooter (31 percent) or free-throw shooter (66 percent), but those watching at the next level believe he'll improve.
""He's definitely not falling on my board,"" said one NBA executive. ""I think he's solidly in that No. 2 slot. Barrett is a scorer, not a shooter. ... He'll be in the gym so much working on shot mechanics at our level. He can develop into a more than respectable long-range threat."" 
A few decades ago, Nash was viewed as the lone Canadian who could compete with the best players in the NBA.
The coming NBA drafts could introduce, however, a new brand of Canadian talent, created in the image of Carter, with athleticism, high-level skills and versatility. Alexander-Walker, the Virginia Tech star, said he hopes the top young players from Canada will one day join forces and compete against the United States in the Olympics.
""I would say it's only a matter of time,"" said Alexander-Walker, a projected first-rounder from Toronto who is averaging 18.8 PPG and connecting on 47 percent of his 3-point attempts. ""We've all been around each other since we were young. We've all seen each other grow as basketball players and it's pretty cool almost to remember we were the same little kids at Team Canada invitationals and development programs and now we're all here.""
Barrett seems comfortable with his role as the catalyst for the future and an extension of a movement Carter, his father and godfather have all helped shape over the past 25 years.
Carter knows his own chapter will soon end. But Barrett wonders if he's on the verge of writing his own.
""I love it,"" he said. ""I get to put on for my country and play for a country that I love. Every day that I wake up, I put my hard hat on just knowing I got a country of people. If I keep doing what I'm doing and I'm successful, it's going to inspire a nation.""

25788326,"American Athletic Conference commissioner Mike Aresco told The Hartford Courant on Thursday that the officials at the center of controversial ejections to UConn coach Dan Hurley and Tulsa counterpart Frank Haith could have handled the situation better, but they will not be disciplined for their actions.
Hurley and Haith received technical fouls during a heated verbal exchange with 11 minutes, 40 seconds to play Wednesday and host Tulsa leading 61-47. When Hurley went to shake Haith's hand after the T's, another double technical was assessed and the coaches were shown the door early.
""We've reviewed the situation,"" Aresco told The Courant. ""Obviously, it was regrettable, it was regrettable. Though the rule book does proscribe certain conduct and you have technical fouls for various things, we've concluded that the situation could have been de-escalated without ejections. It could have been worked through better.""
UConn coach Dan Hurley called his ejection Wednesday night at Tulsa ""surreal"" and noted that he and Frank Haith, who also was ejected, have known each other for years.
Both coaches said they felt the officiating crew overreacted to what Haith called ""a competitive discussion."" Hurley said he wanted to let Haith know that his team hadn't been getting the call on similar fouls to the one whistled on DaQuan Jeffries. He said the escalation to the ejections was ""embarrassing for me, for the university and the conference and shouldn't have happened.""
But he also noted his surprise at the ejections, calling them ""surreal.""
Haith concurred, saying the ejections were not warranted and that he considers Hurley a friend.
""The officials are acting on things that are proscribed by the rule book, but, again, there are always situations that could be handled differently that could lead to a better outcome,"" Aresco said. ""In this particular case, we thought there could have been a de-escalation, but that's as far as I would go because we respect our officials and we respect our coaches.""
Officiating has been a hot-button topic this week in the AAC.
Cincinnati coach Mick Cronin was ejected in the Bearcats' victory Tuesday over South Florida, and later said the officials should be suspended for their actions.

25762355,"Virginia may be looking ahead to the attention that comes with playing Duke on Saturday, but its in-state rival Virginia Tech is also capable of winning the ACC.
Virginia Tech is the sixth best team in the nation, according to ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI), has a potential NBA lottery pick in Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and its only blemish so far is a one-point road loss to Penn State. Despite its 14-1 start, the Hokies have played the weakest strength of schedule in the ACC and have played only one top-50 BPI team -- a neutral-site game against Purdue. According to BPI, no test this season will be greater for them than traveling up I-81 to Charlottesville on Tuesday (8 p.m. ET on the ACC Network) to play against Virginia (No. 1 in BPI).
While Virginia and Duke are the most likely teams to play in the ACC title game, Virginia Tech is third-most likely at 32 percent, according to BPI. I'm not arguing that Virginia Tech is as good as those teams, but it has favorable circumstances and doesn't need too much to go its way to climb to the top of the ACC this season.
The Hokies' advantageous ACC schedule has them playing both Duke (home) and North Carolina (road) only once this season. In fact, after Tuesday's game, Virginia Tech's next hardest game is at North Carolina, which the Hokies have a 42 percent chance of winning.
BPI gives Virginia a 79 percent chance to win Tuesday. However, should Virginia Tech pull off the upset, BPI projects its chance to get a No. 1 seed in March to jump from 32 percent to 47 percent, which would be the fourth highest in the nation.
A month ago, it looked like the ACC was going to belong to Duke. Now, BPI sees Virginia as slight favorites over Duke to win the ACC. Do not be surprised if Wednesday there are three teams eyeing that advantageous ""1"" next to their names in March.

25717197,"The school made the announcement Tuesday in a news release.
Cunningham averaged 8.0 points and 1.1 assists in seven games for the Cowboys, but he hadn't played since Dec. 16 against Nebraska. Before this season, he played 96 games at USC Upstate and had 1,181 points and 281 assists in three seasons.
""Mike has decided that he wants to move on to the next phase of his life,"" coach Mike Boynton said in a statement. ""We wish him well and thank him for the contributions he made in his short time with the program. The standards of Cowboy basketball will never be lowered for a short-term gain. We are building on a foundation established by Mr. Henry Iba, Bryant 'Big Country' Reeves, Desmond Mason and countless others who deserve to always be proud of the way we do things in Stillwater. This year's team, though young, will continue to take pride in who they represent.""

25706165,"The top four in The Associated Press men's college basketball poll remained unchanged for the third straight week. The rest of the poll, however, underwent major changes after three top-10 teams lost.
Duke remained at No. 1 in the AP Top 25 released Monday, receiving 37 of 64 first-place votes. No. 2 Michigan received nine first-place votes, No. 3 Tennessee 13 and No. 4 Virginia five.
Then the jumble begins, thanks to losses by Kansas, Nevada and Florida State.
First-place votes in parentheses
No. 5 Gonzaga, which is finally back to full health, and No. 6 Michigan State each moved up two spots. No. 7 Kansas dropped two spots after losing to Iowa State, which moved back into the poll at No. 20.
No. 8 Texas Tech and No. 9 Virginia Tech each moved up after Nevada lost on the road to New Mexico and fell four places to No. 10. Florida State dropped four spots to No. 13 after being shut down by Virginia.
In all, every team outside the top four changed positions except No. 23 Oklahoma, which split its games last week.
Got all that?
Kansas took the biggest hit last week, not only falling 77-60 to the Cyclones, but losing big man Udoka Azubuike for the rest of the season to a wrist injury. The Jayhawks already have been playing without sophomore forward Silvio De Souza, whose name surfaced in an FBI probe into shady recruiting practices, and the loss of Azubuike could put a dent in their national title hopes.
Nevada passed every early season test it faced, entering last weekend as one of four undefeated teams left.
After the Wolf Pack lost 85-58 to New Mexico, the number of undefeated teams is down to three: Michigan, Virginia and No. 17 Houston.
""We just had a bad night all around,"" Nevada coach Eric Musselman said. ""We had a bad night sharing the ball. We had a bad night defensively. Usually they're zoned in on the scoring report, but we let guys who are shooters take open shots and we didn't play who we are. Just a terrible game for all of us.""
It was a wild week in college basketball, but we know this: The notion that UCLA is aiming too high is fake and that Virginia Tech is a serious ACC threat is real.
Florida State entered ACC play on a roll, its only loss coming to defending national champion Villanova in late November. Then the Seminoles ran into Virginia's defensive buzz saw.
The Cavaliers lead the nation in defensive scoring and shut Florida State down, holding the Seminoles to 15 field goals and 52 points in a 13-point win.
RISING CYCLONES
Iowa State coach Steve Prohm spent the early part of the season biding his team with several players out because of injuries. The Cyclones won two of three games at the Maui Invitational despite being down to eight scholarship players, and their only other loss came at Iowa in early December.
Finally healthy, Iowa State (12-2, 2-0 Big Ten) picked up one of its biggest wins in four seasons under Prohm, blowing out Kansas in Ames on Saturday.
""They're the standard in our league and the team we're all trying to catch,"" Prohm said. ""It's a great win. I loved the way they competed.""
Iowa State moved back into the AP Top 25 this week after reaching No. 18 earlier this season.
UNDEFEATED COUGARS
While Michigan and Virginia get plenty of attention for remaining undefeated while playing in major conferences, Houston continues to keep its record unblemished.
The Cougars had nonconference wins over Oregon, Oklahoma State and LSU, then opened the American Athletic Conference season with victories over Tulsa and Memphis last week. Houston faces Temple and Wichita State this week.
MOVING IN
No. 24 St. John's (14-1, 2-1 Big East) moved into the AP Top 25 for the first time since hitting No. 15 in 2014-15 after knocking off No. 21 Marquette and beating Georgetown in overtime last week.
TCU, which was No. 20 in the preseason AP Top 25, returned to the poll at No. 25 this week following a home win over Baylor.
MOVING OUT
Wisconsin dropped out of the poll from No. 22 after losing to Minnesota and beating Penn State.
Iowa, No. 25 last week, is out after losing to Purdue and beating Nebraska, which dropped out from No. 24.

25724254,"After Wooden won 10 national titles over the previous 12 seasons, his eventual replacement always figured to be more of an anointment.
UCLA didn't so much call Bartow as it called  for  him. So after one 8-18 season at Illinois -- following a three-year stint at Memphis State, during which he guided the Tigers to an NCAA title-game loss against UCLA -- Bartow and his family were off to Southern California to live under a shadow so large it might as well have been night all the time.
His dad's new job might not have seemed impossible at the time for then-13-year-old Murry Bartow, but now, with more than 40 years of hindsight, he has a unique perspective.
""It will be like following Nick Saban with Alabama football,"" said Murry Bartow, who was named UCLA's interim coach when Steve Alford was fired Dec. 31. The Bruins play at Oregon on Thursday (9 p.m. ET, ESPN). ""You do not want to be that next guy. You just don't. And when you follow Coach Wooden, and then he's won 10 of the 12 prior NCAA championships, there's really nowhere to go but down.""
Gene Bartow went 52-9 in two years at UCLA, finishing No. 5 and No. 2 in the polls, but it quickly became obvious, despite strong support and friendship from Wooden, that it wasn't a good long-term fit. When UAB came to him with more money and an opportunity to launch its athletic department and coach the basketball team, he took it.
""He had a lot of great memories out here,"" Bartow said. ""But as a coach, you want to go to work every day and enjoy the wins and really have fun with the wins. I think my dad, over the course of his second year here, it was almost the fear of losing, just trying not to lose instead of the joy of winning.""
In the 43 years since Wooden retired, UCLA basketball continues to exist in the shadow of his legacy. The Bruins have won only one national title (1995) since the end of his reign and haven't advanced past the Sweet 16 in 10 years. Coaches no longer have the direct comparisons that Gene Bartow dealt with, but success at UCLA is still measured with a higher standard than at just about any other school in the country.
That's why Alford started this season on the hot seat, despite reaching the Sweet 16 three times over his five seasons. His teams weren't great, but they were regularly conference-title contenders. Fair or not, that remains well behind the standard UCLA still expects from its basketball team.
When Alford was fired following a 7-6 start that included home losses to Belmont and, the final straw, Liberty, the timing might have been surprising, but it also was easy to understand.
Murry Bartow played and coached for his dad at UAB and served as a graduate assistant at Indiana under Bob Knight in 1987. That's where he met Alford, then a star guard for the Hoosiers. They remained friends over the years, with Bartow serving 18 years as a college head coach at UAB, East Tennessee State and as the interim coach last year at South Florida. Alford hired him in the offseason as an assistant.
""I've been in the business a long time and I'd been let go twice out of two jobs, so I'm not naive to the situation,"" Bartow said. ""I thought this would be an important year, but I was honestly surprised at the timing [of Alford's dismissal].""
Bartow's experience made him the natural choice to hold the interim role, but he'll closely share responsibilities with assistants Duane Broussard and Tyus Edney. When the coaches huddled up to decide what needed to be addressed as they moved on without Alford and started Pac-12 play, they agreed that some of their best attributes -- speed, athleticism -- weren't being taken advantage of as well as they should have been.
""We're not the thickest bunch of guys, we're not at times the grittiest bunch of guys, but we do have speed,"" Bartow said. ""We do have length, we do have athleticism and we do have depth. We've got those four things.""
That's not exactly a bad place to start. Those four things alone, in fact, might be enough to win the Pac-12 this season.
Either way, the sure-to-be-brief Murry Bartow era got off to a promising start last week, with a 92-70 win against Stanford, followed by a 98-83 win against Cal. The Bruins upped the tempo, found some rhythm and looked as good as they have just about all season. Cal and Stanford have their own struggles to worry about at the moment, so not much can really be drawn from those games, but the energy the Bruins played with indicated a renewed sense of spirit.
""I love Bartow's energy,"" UCLA center Moses Brown said after the win against Stanford. ""Like, in practice he does a lot to motivate us, and when Coach was around we just saw how much energy and how much effort he put into us and making us a better team.
""And now that he's the head coach, all of that has started to manifest. And as you can see on the court, we did a good job today. We had more energy, we were playing with them up and down, just having a good time.""
They enjoyed the win, an old Bartow family rule. And it came on the seventh anniversary of Gene Bartow's death.
Coincidently, Stanford coach Jerod Haase shares a connection with the Bartow family, having recently coached at UAB, where the Blazers play in Bartow Arena. Ruth Bartow, who was married to Gene for 59 years before he died, is 87 and a regular at UAB home games.
""Jerod was incredible to my mom while he was there and in terms of just going out to the house to see her writing her notes, giving her a hug after a win,"" Bartow said. ""My mom's at most every game. So Jerod was incredibly gracious to her.""
The Bruins (9-6, 2-0 Pac-12) were one of three Pac-12 teams, along with USC and Arizona, to go 2-0 in the first week of the season and enter Thursday's game at Oregon with a chance to improve on that encouraging start. Without a clear favorite -- or even more than a few decent teams -- the Bruins, despite their early-season struggles and Alford's dismissal, are still somehow among the favorites in the conference.
Oregon (9-5, 0-1) opened conference play with a loss at home against Oregon State, two days after the school announced that prized NBA prospect Bol Bol would miss the rest of the season because of a left foot injury.
Bartow says he knows it will be impossible to shield the players from all the speculation about who will become the next head coach, but he's optimistic there will be no shortage of strong candidates.
""UCLA is still an unbelievable program, an unbelievable brand,"" Bartow said. ""When you go all over the country, you can ask any person, 'Hey, name five or six programs.' UCLA is probably going to be one of them.
""So it's still a marquee program and can certainly continue on with great success.""
Maybe even to the level of Gene Bartow's UCLA teams.

We can't wait to have him back out on the court next season.""
Clark, a sophomore, is averaging 14.6 points and 6.3 rebounds per game. He was leading the nation in field goal shooting at 73.7 percent prior to the injury.
Jared Butler, averaging 6.5 points per game, is replacing Clark in Baylor's starting lineup for Saturday's game against No. 7 Kansas.

25744661,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Duke forward Zion Williamson left the Blue Devils' 80-78 win over Florida State late in the first half Saturday after he was poked in the left eye and did not return.
Williamson was driving inside when multiple Florida State players met him. He started fumbling the ball, Trent Forrest hit him in the face and Williamson landed hard on the court.
He stayed down for several moments, kicking his legs in pain while covering his face, and missed the entire Florida State possession on the other end of the floor. He then came off, saw a trainer, and a few moments later went into the locker room just before the first half ended.
Cam Reddish hit a 3-pointer with 0.8 seconds left to lead No. 1 Duke past No. 13 Florida State 80-78 on Saturday.
When the second half began, Williamson came out with his teammates and sat on the bench but did not enter the game.
""He had double vision,"" Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said afterward. ""He came out in the second half -- Nate [James, associate head coach] told me, with about three minutes to go -- I wasn't out on the court yet; he ran back and said, 'Zion's got double vision.' And I said, 'Well, let's see. He can't play, obviously, if he has that.'
""And we waited, and it didn't clear up. The good thing, he didn't have headaches. Again, I'm not saying intent -- he got poked right in the eye. He's better now. So hopefully he'll be able to play on Monday. But it's a big loss. For this game -- are you kidding? Especially with the athleticism we're facing.""
Williamson was not made available to the media after the game.
When Williamson exited, he had 11 points and eight rebounds. With Williamson out of the game in the second half, Florida State made a concerted effort to go inside more. It had more dunks in the second half than the first.
