26058212,"Some fan bases can't enjoy March like the rest of us. Whether it's because their teams never make it, they make it only to get heartbroken or they have to sit there and suffer while their rivals cut down the nets, ""March Madness"" turns into ""March Sadness."" If you're a fan of one of those schools, this article is for you. Here is the College Basketball Misery Index.

It is patterned off the professional Sports Misery Index, in which we've broken down each school in the top seven conferences (ACC, American, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC) and Gonzaga to see how miserable they truly are. The full methodology will be outlined below, but teams are evaluated in seven categories: Championships, Final Fours, conference titles (regular-season and conference tournament), NCAA tournament berths, NCAA tournament wins, heartbreaks and rival comparison. Recent events are weighted more, NCAA sanctions are not considered, and the higher the score, the more miserable we think you should be. Like in an NCAA tournament, we have seeded every school, and we evaluated teams from the 1938-39 season (when the NCAA tournament started) until now.
You won't see big write-ups on schools such as Villanova, Duke, North Carolina, Kansas, Kentucky and Michigan State. They'll get plenty of coverage in the upcoming tourney.
Here we go. Results are based on events through the 2017-18 season, so this year's regular-season conference titles have not been factored in.
The seven primary factors in the College Basketball Fan Misery Index formula:
1. Championships: The more (and more recently) you win championships, the less you have to complain about. However, if your most recent championship was 25-plus years ago, it's almost as if you've never won at all.
2. Final Fours: Winning a national championship isn't the only reason to cut down nets or hang a banner the next season, as making the Final Four is a worthwhile accomplishment. It's hard to be mad when you're playing in a football stadium during the final weekend.
3. Conference championships: Whether you emerge as the best of your peers during the regular season or go on a run in the conference tournament to grab an automatic bid, conference titles are a subject of pride. If you win a lot of them (looking at you, Kansas), no one cares to hear your bellyaching.
4. Tournament berths: How are you going to win a championship if you don't make the tournament? It's bad to not cut the nets at the end of the year, but not even putting yourself in the Big Dance is cause for a venting session or 10. We won't tolerate too much whining from teams that are always in the postseason.
5. Tournament wins: Great, you're in the tournament, but what's the point if you don't do anything once you're there? Seeing your team go one-and-done or lose the first weekend in the postseason is quite painful -- almost as bad as missing the tourney altogether. But if you win tournament games every year and are making regular Sweet 16 runs, you have less reason to complain.
6. Heartbreaks: It's one thing to lose -- it's another to get your heart ripped out of your chest ""Temple of Doom""-style. Whether it's blowing a big lead, losing at the buzzer, being shocked by a Cinderella or simply losing the title game, it's OK to be miserable. However, some winning teams scored high in this metric because you're going to have more ""bad beats"" the more you play at the final table.
7. Rival comparison: Having your team stink and break your heart is bad enough, but having the fans of the schools you hate celebrating championships and tournament runs is salt in the wound.
Note that this formula takes into account the recency factor: Winning a championship in the past five years does not allow you to be miserable, nor does anyone care about some heartbreak that happened 30-40 years ago (get over Keith Smart, Syracuse). Stuff that happened last season is factored more than stuff that happened two-to-five years ago, which means more than stuff six-to-10 years ago, which means more than stuff 11-20 years ago, which means more than ... you get the picture.
Also, all conference titles matter. Plenty of teams (Butler, Wichita State, etc.) beat up on mid-major conferences in the past before being promoted to the big time. Part of their lack of misery comes from being able to participate in this exercise in the first place. That's also why Gonzaga fans aren't likely to complain (or get much sympathy if they try).
How can a school that produced the likes of Tim Duncan and Chris Paul have the most miserable power-conference college basketball fan base? It's pretty easy: No matter what you do, you're completely overshadowed by Duke and North Carolina (and to a certain extent, NC State). Wake is by far the most tortured school when it comes to comparisons to rivals.
The Demon Deacons have made the tournament once in the past eight seasons, haven't won a conference title since 2003 and have made only one Final Four, back in 1962. But there'd be a little more pride about those occasional achievements if they didn't have such basketball giants as rivals. It's another sad March at Wake, and it has been nearly 15 years since Paul was on campus.
Another North Carolina-based school makes the top line, but for completely different reasons. Sure, East Carolina has some sort of envy toward the powerful Tar Heels, but the misery of a Pirates fan is based more on meek acceptance of futility than trash talk from rival schools.
If you didn't know that East Carolina played basketball, you're not alone. The Pirates have made the tournament only twice -- the most recent in 1993 -- and are one of only three teams in this group of 88 that have never won a tournament game. They've never won a regular-season conference championship, and being in a tough American conference won't help them change that.
Penn State fans are generally content with their football program, but Happy Valley is hardly satisfied with the state of the Nittany Lions' basketball program. That's when they even notice -- the Bryce Jordan Center regularly puts tarps over unsold seats to PSU basketball games.
You can't blame Penn State fans for being despondent. The Nittany Lions have been to the tournament once since 2001 and haven't won a tournament game since they made the 2001 Sweet 16 -- their high-water mark of the past 60 years. Penn State hasn't won a regular-season or conference tournament since it joined the Big Ten in 1992-93 and has to watch conference rivals (Ohio State) and in-state rivals (Pitt and Temple) have success.
We know what you're thinking: How can Arizona State be a top seed in a misery index when it a) went to the NCAA tournament last year and b) got to watch James Harden in college? It's actually pretty easy, as Sun Devils basketball has been an exercise in futility -- and we're not even factoring in their 1990s point-shaving scandal.
Being an Arizona State basketball fan stinks in two ways: dealing with Arizona and overall lack of success. While the rival Wildcats rack up conference titles by the bushel, Arizona State hasn't won a Pac-12 title of any kind since joining in 1978-79. The Sun Devils last won an NCAA tournament game in 2009, haven't been to the Sweet 16 since 1995 and have never been past that round.
Unlike the teams above, Vanderbilt has been to the tournament quite a few times lately, making it seven of the previous 12 seasons. But Vanderbilt's misery -- besides having Kentucky as a rival -- comes from the heartbreak that happens in the tournament.
Vanderbilt has been an upset special for years, as it has lost three times in the round of 64 as a No. 5 or better seed since 2008. It ranks in the top 25 in heartbreaks, a category that tends to be populated by schools that make deep tournament runs. That's not the case for Vandy, which has never progressed past the Sweet 16. This year only adds to the misery, as top-five recruit Darius Garland was knocked out early and the Commodores finished 0-18 in the SEC.
Washington State has been a grooming spot for a recent perennial NBA All-Star, as Klay Thompson did fine work in the Palouse before becoming part of the Golden State Warriors' dynasty. But that, and one good season under Tony Bennett, is about all Cougars fans have had to cheer about.
Bennett got Wazzu to back-to-back NCAA tournaments, including a run to the Sweet 16 in 2008, before leaving for Virginia. It has been ugly ever since. Washington State is set to miss the NCAA tournament for the 11th straight season and hasn't had a winning season since 2010-11. Things pre-Bennett weren't great, either, as the Cougars have made the tournament only six times and haven't won the Pac-12 since 1941, when it was called the Pacific Coast Conference.
Speaking of point-shaving scandals, Boston College's gambling scandal was so famous that it became a 30 for 30 that featured Henry Hill of ""Goodfellas"" fame. The on-court play hasn't been good in Chestnut Hill, as we're going on 10 years since the Eagles' last NCAA tournament appearance and a dozen since their last tourney win.
The past decade-plus of misery has eroded the hope in a fan base that used to have things to cheer about, as Boston College won a Big East regular-season championship in 2005 and made a run to the Elite 8 in 1994. But it has been pretty miserable for BC since it lost to Villanova in overtime in the Sweet 16 in 2006. While the Eagles have been scuffling, fellow New England school UConn has four national championships since 1999.
USF basketball fans aren't the most demanding, realizing that the growth of their football program (and subsequent move up the conference food chain) makes it tough for basketball. But that said, Bulls basketball hasn't delivered in its 40-plus years of existence.
South Florida has made the NCAA tournament three times and has won only two tournament games, both in 2012. Even that 2012 season wasn't worth getting excited about as a) the Bulls won with a very hard-to-watch defensive style that kept scoring in the 50s and lower and b) it was followed by six straight seasons of 19 or more losses. USF has won only two conference titles, making its quest to gain respect a harrowing one.
The Knights, behind 7-foot-6 Tacko Fall, look like they will crash the tournament in March, but the previous 34 seasons of UCF basketball haven't been great, as the Knights have gone through many of the same growing pains as their directional-school rival, South Florida.
UCF has nearly the same résumé as USF and is lacking the Bulls' NCAA tournament wins, as the Knights join East Carolina and Nebraska as the only teams on this list to not win a tournament game. However, UCF is on the three line due to more NCAA tourney appearances (four to three) and more conference titles (five to two). That said, it hasn't been fun to support UCF, so enjoy Fall, B.J. Taylor and Aubrey Dawkins while you can.
Tom Crean has a task that has bedeviled many coaches before him: jump-starting Georgia basketball. It has been a thankless task since an unlikely run to the 1983 Final Four, as the Dawgs have had only two real highlights since: a run to the Sweet 16 in 1996 and a Cinderella SEC tournament title in 2008.
Even Georgia's good moments have a caveat, as the 1996 run was eclipsed in heartbreaking fashion by John Wallace and Syracuse in overtime. But that's about as good as it gets for Dawgs hoops, which hasn't had an NCAA tournament victory since 2002. Despite having national title-winning coaches (at other schools, obviously) such as Jim Harrick and Tubby Smith, Georgia has not been able to maintain success while rival Florida has emerged as a hoops power.
TCU is ranked this high despite making the tournament last season, which highlights how bad things were before Jamie Dixon arrived. The Horned Frogs were mired in quicksand, as last year's tournament bid was their first since 2008 and their eighth overall.
While TCU is ranked lower on this list than it would have been last year, there's a lot for Frogs fans to be sullen about. Last year's upset loss to Syracuse extended a tournament victory drought that dates to 1987, and TCU hasn't won a conference title since it won the WAC in 1998. Dixon has TCU in contention for another berth, but it'll take a tourney win or two to chip away at the misery.
It's hard to believe, but the Beavers used to be the premier program not named UCLA out West, as OSU went to three Final Fours before 1963, was a perennial tourney team under Ralph Miller and had star players such as Gary Payton and A.C. Green.
While Gary Payton II was recently a star in Corvallis, the past three decades of Oregon State basketball have been depressing. The Beavers have made the tournament once since 1990, haven't won a tournament game since 1982 and haven't won a conference title of any kind since 1990. Meanwhile, hated Oregon has made Elite 8s and a Final Four. Oregon State is spunky this season, though, so maybe there's hope?
The Cornhuskers are the third team on this list that has never won an NCAA tournament game. Not only that, Nebraska hasn't won a conference championship since it won the Big 8 tournament in 1994 and was snubbed from the tournament last season despite winning 13 Big Ten games, something that had never happened.
So how are the Huskers this ""low?"" Nebraska did make the tournament recently, qualifying in 2014, and the Huskers are blessed to have rivals that haven't completely torn it up. While Creighton, Iowa and Minnesota have had more success than Nebraska, none of them has made it to the Sweet 16 this millennium. Therefore, there's less outside angst.
Tulane is another American team that seems to have bitten off more than it can chew, as the Green Wave haven't made the NCAA tournament since 1995, when they were in the now-defunct Metro Conference. Not even a former NBA coach, Mike Dunleavy, has been able to change their fortunes.
How is Tulane, which gave up basketball for four seasons in the 1980s due to a point-shaving scandal, a 4-seed? A little bit of Nebraska, as the Wave don't have recently successful rivals to mock them. The Green Wave have also won a tournament game in each of their three appearances, something very few schools can say.
We're approaching the 15-year anniversary of Georgia Tech's run to the NCAA title game, in which Tech's dream of an NCAA title was ruined by Ben Gordon, Emeka Okafor and Connecticut. The Yellow Jackets have lived in a nightmare since, as they've made only three tournaments, the last coming in 2010.
Georgia Tech, which once produced future NBA stars such as Chris Bosh, Kenny Anderson and Stephon Marbury, will miss the tournament for a ninth straight year and hasn't won a conference title since 1996. Forget about competing with rival North Carolina -- Georgia Tech has a hard time keeping up with the likes of Clemson.
DePaul used to be one of the hottest brands in college hoops, as players such as Terry Cummings, Mark Aguirre and Rod Strickland starred for a Blue Demons program that was a tournament regular in the late 1970s and 1980s. But even then DePaul tended to underachieve in a tournament setting.
It'd love that opportunity now, though, as DePaul hasn't made the NCAA tournament since 2004 and has missed it 17 of the past 18 seasons. It hasn't had a winning season since 2006-07 and isn't even the top dog in Chicago anymore, as Northwestern recently won a tourney game and Sister Jean and Loyola-Chicago won the city's heart with their Final Four run last year.
Imagine where the Hokies would be if they hadn't made two straight tournaments and weren't on their way to a third this season. But even with the recent success under Buzz Williams, it's tough to be a Virginia Tech basketball fan. The Hokies haven't gotten out of the first round since 2007, have made the Sweet 16 once (in 1967) and haven't won a conference title since 1996. Add rival Virginia's becoming a national power and some painful tourney snubs during the Seth Greenberg era, and the Hokies need some tournament wins.
The Big Ten portion of the five line starts with a Wildcats team that would be way higher on the list if this had been done three years ago. Northwestern hadn't qualified for the NCAA tournament before 2017, when it beat Vanderbilt in the first round and gave Gonzaga a run in the second. That recent success bolstered Northwestern's portfolio a bit, despite the Wildcats' never winning a conference title in the tournament era. Northwestern has also been better than in-state rival Illinois and Chicago-area rival DePaul recently, something that's extremely rare.
As hard as it might be to believe, Rutgers has been to the Final Four, as the Scarlet Knights made a run in 1976. They haven't made many runs since, as Rutgers last made the NCAA tournament in 1991 and hasn't won a tournament game since 1983. The year 1991 was also the last time Rutgers won a conference title. It could be worse for the Knights, though, as their rivals haven't been great lately, either. We documented Penn State's issues above, and Seton Hall and Maryland have generally been disappointing in the past 10-15 years.
Minnesota has been to a Final Four, as the Golden Gophers went on a wonderful run in 1997 after winning the Big Ten championship. They're lucky we didn't consider the sanctions for academic dishonesty that caused the NCAA to invalidate that season, as Minnesota would be much higher on this list if we had. It has been rough in the 22 years since, as the Gophers haven't won a conference championship or advanced past the first weekend of the NCAA tournament. Watching Wisconsin make back-to-back Final Fours earlier this decade wasn't pleasant, either.
Like Wake Forest above, NC State has a North Carolina/Duke problem. It's even worse than what the Demon Deacons face, as NC State is in the same metro area as the Tar Heels and Blue Devils. Because of that, nothing the Wolfpack do stacks up -- not even their two national championships. Of course, it doesn't help that the last title (in 1983) is a memory that most of their fans know only from 30 for 30 clips. Nor does it help that NC State hasn't won a conference title of any kind since 1989 or advanced past the Sweet 16 since 1986.
While much of USC's misery comes from being in the same city as UCLA, the Bruins aren't the only reason the Trojans are rated this high in angst. Despite its location in a talent-rich area, USC hasn't been able to maintain consistent success or much success at all. The Trojans were a notable snub from last year's tournament field and haven't made it past the first weekend since 2007. USC hasn't won a regular-season Pac-12 title since 1985 and hasn't made a Final Four since 1954.
Current St. John's head coach Chris Mullin was a key part of the Red Storm's best moment, as he led them to the Final Four. The problem is that Final Four appearance happened in 1985 and doesn't really register with most Johnnies fans today. St. John's basketball has struggled mightily since making the Elite 8 in 1999, as the Red Storm missed the tournament six of the past seven seasons and haven't won a tourney game since 2000, which was the last time they won a conference title. It hasn't been pretty.
Clemson fans had a ray of hope last year with their team's run to the Sweet 16, but that was a rare glimpse of sunshine for a program used to darkness and regret. Prior to last season, Clemson's last tournament win was in 2011 and its last Sweet 16 appearance was 1997. The Tigers have one ACC title since joining that conference in 1954 (which came in 1990) and have never won a road game at rival North Carolina, dropping 59 consecutive away games to the Tar Heels. And now they have to sweat out Selection Sunday.
Older Pirates fans insist that Rumeal Robinson was not fouled and did not deserve the two free throws that vaulted Michigan past Seton Hall in overtime of the 1989 title game. Younger Pirates fans would love to get that far and have that type of bad memory. Although the Pirates made the tournament the past three seasons and won a game last year, it has been 19 years since Seton Hall made it to the Sweet 16. That doesn't cut it, especially when hated rival Villanova has won two national championships recently.
Tad Boyle has brought a little happiness to Buffaloes hoops, as Colorado made the tournament four times in five seasons from 2012 to '16, including winning the Pac-12 tournament in its first year in the league in 2012. That said, minimal success is about all fans in Boulder can expect, as Colorado has won two tournament games since 1970 (one of those came when Chauncey Billups played for CU). It has been 50 years since the Buffaloes made the Sweet 16.
Larry Brown got SMU back on the map in his four seasons with the Mustangs, building a team that won American regular-season and tournament titles in 2015 and 2017. But those campaigns ended on a sour note with first-round upsets to Los Angeles-based Pac-12 teams, as UCLA shocked the Mustangs in a controversial first-round loss in 2015, and USC sent SMU home prematurely two years later. SMU hasn't won a tournament game since 1988, a streak that will continue this season.
The Huskies are the best of a pretty uninspiring Pac-12 this season, but don't expect Washington fans to apologize for the mediocrity of their peers. After seven consecutive years of missing the tournament, including in 2012, despite winning the regular-season conference title, the Huskies will take what they get. Even their rare moments of success have ended in heartbreak, as they were upset by Louisville as a No. 1 seed in the 2005 Sweet 16 and were heartbroken by a Richard Hamilton buzzer-beater in 1998.
Recent history hasn't been kind to Mizzou. The Tigers missed the tournament four consecutive seasons before making it last year and haven't won a tourney game since 2010, a streak that includes a loss to No. 15-seeded Norfolk State as a No. 2 seed in 2012. But more than anything, Missouri fans are miserable because of their rival, Kansas. While the Jayhawks have won three national championships and regularly make long tourney runs, the Tigers have never been to the Final Four, getting beaten in the Elite 8 in 1994, 2002 and 2009.
Making the NCAA tournament hasn't been a problem for the Friars, as they've qualified five years in a row prior to this season. Winning tournament games has been a different thing altogether for Providence, which hasn't advanced past the round of 32 since 1997, when Austin Croshere led a run to the Elite 8. But even that achievement, and making the Final Four in 1987 behind coach Rick Pitino and star guard Billy Donovan, is diminished when compared to rival UConn's national titles.
While the Rebels are looking good for a tournament berth this season, Ole Miss basketball hasn't been a bastion of success. Except for Marshall Henderson's spirited run in 2013 that led to an SEC tournament championship and a first-round upset of Wisconsin in the NCAA tourney, the 17 seasons since the Rebels' last foray into the Sweet 16 have seen mostly pain and anguish. The seasons before that weren't much better, as 2001 represents Ole Miss' best tournament performance.
Like NC State, Cal has a national championship in the tournament era. Unfortunately for Bears fans, it came in 1959, which means that no one 65 or younger has any recollection of it. What modern-day Cal fans have recollection of is disappointment, as the Golden Bears haven't been to the Sweet 16 since 1997. Cal has had its share of great players (Jason Kidd, Jaylen Brown, etc.), but the Bears haven't won a Pac-12 title since 2010, and their last tourney appearance was an upset by No. 13 seed Hawaii in 2016.
While Iowa has a bit more going for it than Minnesota, it hasn't been an easy two decades for Hawkeyes fans. Iowa has not made it to the Sweet 16 since 1999, and its only conference titles since 1979 were Big Ten tourney titles in 2001 and 2006. Meanwhile, rival Wisconsin has been extremely successful.
It has been a long 13 years since Glen ""Big Baby"" Davis led the Tigers to the Final Four. LSU has struggled mightily since, making the NCAA tournament only twice. While this year's team has brought hope (and an SEC title), players such as Shaquille O'Neal and Ben Simmons have had difficulties making LSU a consistent power.
Tulsa has a rich history of success, as coaches such as Nolan Richardson, Tubby Smith and Bill Self cut their teeth with the Golden Hurricane before moving to bigger schools. But after making three Sweet 16s and an Elite 8 from 1994 to 2000, that success has dried up, as Tulsa hasn't won an NCAA tournament game since 2003.
Mississippi State was a tournament regular in the mid-1990s and the 2000s, highlighted by a trip to the 1996 Final Four. But the Bulldogs haven't been to the tournament this decade (though that should change this year) and haven't made it past the first weekend since that 1996 run, despite having several highly seeded teams.
Houston thought it turned a corner last March, when it won its first tourney game since 1984 and seemingly had Michigan beaten in the second round. Then Jordan Poole hit a prayer to eliminate the Cougars, giving them a helping of misery that they last faced when Lorenzo Charles' dunk allowed NC State to upset Houston in the 1983 title game.
It might be hard to imagine South Carolina being miserable, as the Gamecocks advanced to the Final Four two years ago, but they missed the tournament last year and before 2017 hadn't won a tournament game since 1973. They haven't won a conference title since 1997, a year when they were upset by No. 15 seed Coppin State in the tourney.
If the Red Raiders are this high the year after they made the Elite 8, how high would they have been before last year's tournament? Except for a couple years under Bob Knight and a Sweet 16 run in 1996, Texas Tech has struggled, as it hadn't won a Big 12 title of any kind since it joined the conference in 1996-97 before getting a share this season.
Alabama has typically had bragging rights over in-state rival Auburn on the hardwood but is slated behind the Tigers due to not having advanced past the first weekend since a 2004 Elite 8 run and having made the tournament twice in the past 12 seasons. The Tide haven't won an SEC title since 2011.
Speaking of Auburn, the Tigers would have been quite a bit higher a year ago, as last season's SEC title added some joy (even with the lopsided second-round loss to Clemson). Auburn had missed the tournament 14 straight seasons before last year and has made it only four times since 1988, though it does have a cool alumnus in Charles Barkley.
Stanford gets to turn its nose up at Cal, which is basically what a Stanford fan wants. That's a big reason the Cardinal are this low. Stanford has struggled for the most part since the Lopez twins left in 2008 and hasn't won a Pac-12 title since 2004, but the run to the Sweet 16 in 2014 is fresh enough to lessen some of the misery.
Temple used to be consistently above average, as the Owls made 12 straight tournaments from 1990 to 2001 and six consecutive from 2008 to '13. Temple made five Elite 8 appearances between 1988 and 2001. The Owls haven't flown as high lately, though, as they've missed the tournament four times in the past five years and haven't won a conference title since 2012.
While missing the tournament the past three seasons hasn't been enjoyable for Hoyas fans, Georgetown misery comes mostly from upset losses. The Hoyas have lost five times to double-digit seeds since 2008, most notably to Stephen Curry and Davidson in 2008 and as the victims of Florida Gulf Coast's ""Dunk City"" display in the round of 64 in 2013.
Markus Howard has Marquette fans feeling good this season, but the Golden Eagles have missed four of the past five NCAA tournaments and had to watch in-state rival Wisconsin surge. That said, the Golden Eagles have a more recent national championship than the Badgers and can remember Dwyane Wade leading Marquette to the Final Four in 2003.
The Cowboys used to be consistent high-performers, as they made the tournament 13 times in 15 seasons from 1991 to 2005, including Final Four runs in 1995 (behind Bryant ""Big Country"" Reeves) and 2004. But it has been a decade since the Pokes won a tournament game and 14 years since they won any type of Big 12 championship.
You'd think there wouldn't be much misery for the Wildcats, who are fresh off an unlikely run to the Elite 8 last season and have made the NCAA tournament eight of the past 11 years. But having Kansas as a rival skews things for K-State, as the Jayhawks are a big reason the Wildcats had only one conference title since 1980 before splitting with Texas Tech this season.
Recent struggles have made the Illinois fan base kind of sullen, as the Fighting Illini have missed the past five tournaments and are en route to missing a sixth. While Illini fans have fond memories of the Deron Williams-Dee Brown national runner-up team in 2005, Illinois hasn't progressed past the first weekend of the tournament since that Final Four run.
While last year's Elite 8 run as a No. 9 seed was nice, Seminoles fans are annoyed by Leonard Hamilton's time-management skills in that game, along with having only one ACC championship in 27 seasons.
The Cyclones have been successful and entertaining recently and are headed back to the tournament, but NCAA pitfalls (Georges Niang's injury, Aaron Craft's shot, upsets to UAB and Hampton) have provided some headaches.
The Hurricanes have equipped themselves well since Jim Larranaga became coach, as they have been to the Sweet 16 twice and pulled the title sweep (regular-season and conference) in 2013. But the Sweet 16 is as far as the U has gone.
It's amazing how much Bears basketball has improved, as they went from tragedy and probation in the 2000s to being a tourney regular. The biggest Baylor angst lately is its first-round upset loss to Georgia State in 2015.
The Kevin Stallings era is the main source of Pitt's misery, as the Panthers were tournament fixtures under Jamie Dixon. Scottie Reynolds' last-second layup in the 2009 Elite 8 also gives Panthers fans the shakes.
The Utes have missed the tourney seven of the past nine seasons, but their misery primarily has to do with NCAA tourney games against Kentucky. Utah has lost six to the Wildcats since 1993, including the 1998 national title game.
The Volunteers will assuredly fall down this list next year, but last March's last-second upset loss to Sister Jean and Loyola in the second round was enough for them to safely make it into the bracket this year.
Despite their struggles this season, the Aggies have been to the Sweet 16 two of the past three years. A&M has never been past that round, though, and it has only one conference title since 1987.
The ""40 Minutes of Hell"" era in the 1990s was big for the Razorbacks, culminating in a 1994 national title, but Arkansas hasn't advanced past the first weekend of the NCAA tournament since 1996.
The Bluejays have been an NCAA mainstay (five tourneys in the past seven seasons) and always have bragging rights over in-state rival Nebraska but haven't advanced to the Sweet 16 since 1974.
Penny Hardaway is back at a program that hasn't gotten over Mario Chalmers' dagger (and corresponding loss to Kansas) in the 2008 title game. It has been 10 years since the Tigers made the Sweet 16.
The Longhorns are a tournament staple (18 of the past 20), but Texas hasn't made it past the first weekend since 2008 and was the victim of a half-court buzzer-beater by Northern Iowa in 2016.
Purdue's misery comes from not making the Final Four since 1980, which includes being hijacked by Isaac Haas' freak broken elbow that hindered a potential run in last year's tournament.
You wouldn't expect a blue blood to be in this field, but the five-time national champion Hoosiers haven't won it all since 1987 and have qualified for only four of the past 10 tournaments.
UMBC. That letter combination makes Cavaliers fans shudder, and being the first No. 1 seed to lose to a 16-seed is enough to get Virginia into the field as a 16. Seems fitting, doesn't it?
The Bearcats have made the Sweet 16 once since 2001, despite playing in 12 tourneys. Last year's second-round flameout might have been the worst, as they coughed up a 22-point lead to Nevada.
The Terps have a 2002 national title to their credit but haven't been as successful lately, winning their last conference title in 2010 and making the Sweet 16 once since 2003.
Irish fans don't have much to be disappointed about lately, as consecutive Elite 8 appearances in 2015 and 2016 are fresh, but losing Bonzie Colson sabotaged a potential tourney team last year.
Wichita State fans have had it good lately, but an upset loss to Marshall in the first round last season and two recent losses to Kentucky, one as a No. 1 seed, have left a bit of a sting.
The Sooners skate into the field despite making the Final Four three years ago. Last season's late skid with Trae Young, culminating in a first-round, OT loss in the tourney, was enough.
West Virginia Mountaineers, 4.29: It's hard to get mad at five Sweet 16s and a 2010 Final Four since Bob Huggins was hired before the 2007-08 season.
Ohio State Buckeyes, 1.99: Last year's unexpected tourney berth was another positive for a program that has been to two Final Fours since 2007.
Xavier Musketeers, -4.98: Xavier won the Big East regular-season title last year and has been to six Sweet 16s and two Elite 8s in the past 11 seasons.
Butler Bulldogs, -5.04: Butler fans still bask in the glow of making it to back-to-back national title games in 2010 and 2011.
Oregon Ducks, -6.12: Missing the tournament last season was disappointing, but the Ducks went to an Elite 8 and Final Four the two years before that.
Michigan Wolverines, -6.93: Two national final appearances since 2013 and back-to-back Big Ten tournament titles have the Wolverines in a good place.
Louisville Cardinals, -8.88: The 2013 national title victory over Michigan still counts in the hearts of Cardinals fans, despite what the NCAA offices say.
UCLA Bruins, -11.84: Steve Alford angst is why the Bruins are here, but he's gone and 11 national titles cause smugness -- even if most of them came before you were born.
Florida Gators, -13.19

26268612,"IT SEEMED so unremarkable at first, something only a mother would notice.
Instead of running to the sink like most middle schoolers and washing his hands as fast as he could, 13-year-old Connor Odom would wash, rewash and then wash his hands again. His mother, Lucia Odom, thought it was odd, but didn't really worry until, over time, she saw his hands -- red, chaffed and nearly raw up to his wrists.
Then, it was the showers. Ten minutes turned into 20. Twenty minutes turned into an hour. An hour became three hours. Connor wouldn't, couldn't, get out of the shower even though the hot water would always run out.
""It was almost like he had these glazed-over eyes, like he was present but not present,"" Lucia remembered. ""I knew it wasn't normal.""
Lucia knew what it was like to live an unconventional life. The wife of a collegiate basketball coach, she often fought through the routine, day-to-day battles of family life on her own, while her husband, Ryan Odom, fought to keep his latest coaching position. After UNC-Charlotte's head coach fell ill in the middle of the season, Ryan suddenly found himself thrust into the position of interim head coach. His job, and that of his entire staff, was on the line.
Faced with that burden, Lucia decided to keep her son's struggles a secret from her husband. She wouldn't tell him she was worried that something was very wrong with their son.
FOR THE ODOMS, basketball is family, and the family is all about basketball.
Ryan's father, Dave Odom, spent 25 years coaching in the ACC, including a stint in the 1980s as an assistant coach at the University of Virginia. Ryan was a ball boy in those days and would sit behind the visitors bench so he could listen to North Carolina coach Dean Smith, Maryland's Lefty Driesell and Duke's Mike Krzyzewski lead their teams. After Ryan graduated from Division III Hampden-Sydney College in 1996, where his 3-point field goal record still stands, he joined the family business and started coaching.
Ryan moved every other season over the first decade of his career, taking assistant coaching jobs all along the East Coast. At the same time, he and Lucia started a family. Connor arrived first, followed by Owen two years later.
As the boys grew up, it was not uncommon to see them playing pickup games in the family's backyard. For Connor, in particular, basketball was something he could always count on -- the calming rhythm of bouncing the ball and taking the shot as he practiced his 3-point shot.
By 2015, when Connor was 13, Lucia was having trouble getting him to school because he was terrified of germs. He wouldn't let anyone come into their house. He wouldn't even let Lucia touch him.
""He didn't like people being close to him, talking to him, thinking he would get contaminated,"" Lucia said. ""It morphed into germs that weren't real.""
Lucia had come to the hard conclusion that her son had a serious mental illness.
""You know your child and you know something isn't right and you go to the doctor and you try to tell them this isn't right and they don't hear you,"" she said. ""It'd be like someone telling Ryan how to coach a basketball team when they're not a basketball coach. People don't like to be questioned when it's their profession.""
After going only 8-11 at the end of the 2015 season, Ryan and the entire UNC-Charlotte staff were let go.
""Probably the worst point in our life,"" Lucia said. ""But it turned into a blessing because that, in turn, brought Ryan home.""
Ryan knew Connor had been behaving oddly but didn't appreciate the severity of the situation.
""I've never had adversity like this,"" Ryan said. ""To see your son struggling like he was and not be able to have the expertise or the ability to help -- it was a big mystery.""
Connor said his rational brain knew the germs weren't real and wouldn't make him sick; but at the same time, he would still feel compelled to start washing all over again if he didn't wash them off in a certain way.
""So, I just kept giving in to the temptation to wash,"" he said. ""And it made it worse.""
Through audio and video recordings, Lucia documented how difficult it was for Connor to stop washing his hands or get out of the shower. In one audio clip, they have an exchange as she tries to get him out of the shower.
""I just want to go to school,"" Connor said.
Lucia replies: ""Then we need to go.""
Connor whimpers: ""I can't! It's like I'm in jail. Like my mind is shackled and I don't have the key to get the shackles off!""
Connor said he could not think clearly: ""My mind was blurry.""
""It's like I'm being tortured!"" Connor cries in another recording.
""I don't want to disappoint anyone,"" Connor tells his mother when she urges him to get out of the shower. ""But I just can't!""
Only basketball could lure Connor outside.
""That was the one thing, ironically, Connor could do,"" Ryan said. ""He couldn't go to school, he couldn't do anything, but he could play basketball. We could talk him out of the shower and get him out of there to go play basketball.""
But then came Connor's AAU tournament. ""We were at nationals,"" Connor recalled. ""I had a game and I was in the shower for three hours.""
""He just couldn't get out of the shower,"" Ryan said. ""We couldn't get him to the game.""
Connor had brain scans; he met with psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists. Nothing worked.
""It was the hardest thing I think I've ever dealt with in my life, knowing I couldn't fix my son,"" Lucia said.
By that summer of 2015, doctors diagnosed Connor with severe Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which causes someone to repeat behaviors because of uncontrollable, reoccurring thoughts. Connor was terrified of germs. He couldn't stop thinking about them.
""It's like a washing machine,"" Ryan said. ""That's all they can think about. It just goes over and over and over again. And what happened with Connor is he began to develop rituals,"" like washing his hands, ""to deal with those thoughts.""
None of the doctors they met with could explain why the OCD had set in or how to stop it.
Desperate to find answers, Lucia went to her local library to search for books about OCD.
""'Saving Sammy' was the only book they had, so I got it, went home and read it,"" she said. ""Within the first five pages I just said, 'Oh my gosh, this is what's wrong with Connor!'""
In the book, Sammy's mother, Beth Alison Maloney, learns her son's OCD was caused by a previously undiagnosed strep infection. The Odoms decided to have Connor tested for strep and his numbers were through the roof, even though he didn't have a sore throat or other classic symptoms of strep.
Connor then was diagnosed with Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus or what is commonly referred to as PANDAS. He began antibiotic treatment to kill the strep and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, with Lucia for intensive OCD therapy at Rogers Behavioral Health. Ryan moved into a small apartment in Hickory, North Carolina, after taking a job as head coach at Lenoir-Rhyne University, a small Division II school. Ryan's parents, Dave and Lynn, along with Lucia's mother, moved in with 12-year-old Owen so he could stay at his school in Charlotte.
It was the hardest year of their lives.
LOCATED IN THE SUBURBS of Catonsville, Maryland, the University of Maryland-Baltimore County wasn't nearly as big or famous as its sister school 30 minutes down the road. The University of Maryland Terrapins won a national championship in 2002, and they regularly rank within the top 25. In comparison, the UMBC Retrievers had only one NCAA tournament appearance (2008) and had since endured a losing record every season.
When UMBC called Ryan to take over its men's basketball job in the spring of 2016, he told his family he might not get another chance at a Division I head-coaching job again.
""I didn't know what UMBC was, like a lot of other people didn't,"" Lucia said. ""I didn't know what to think. They're not known for their basketball, but I've always had confidence in Ryan. He just needed a chance.""
So, just months after the family finally reunited in Charlotte, everyone packed up and moved to Maryland. Connor and Owen started at a new school, and they built a small basketball court in the backyard. Ryan quickly turned his new team around, helping the Retrievers win 21 games, three-times as much as their previous season.
But just as Ryan began his second season with UMBC, Connor's issues resurfaced in October 2017.
""The showers just progressively went from five minutes to 10 minutes to 15 minutes,"" Connor said. ""I was so embarrassed. I didn't want to tell my parents I was getting sick again until, finally, they could just tell.""
His doctors were perplexed. The strep was gone, so why had the OCD returned?
As Connor and Lucia headed back to Nashville for another round of intensive therapy, Ryan made the decision to tell his players about his family's troubles.
""I didn't want to hide that from them,"" Ryan said. ""They need to see their coach be torn up a little bit about what's happening. No different than I need to understand that they're going to go through some things and I'm going to have to help them when they're at their worst.""
The team rallied behind its coach.
""We were there for him,"" UMBC guard Jairus Lyles said. ""The fact we were good and we were winning games, that kind of took the stress off too.""
The Retrievers were not only winning. They went on to clinch the 2018 America East Conference championship. They were headed to the NCAA tournament.
UMBC FORWARD GUARD Joe Sherburne vividly remembers Ryan's locker room ahead of the Retrievers' first-round game in Charlotte on March 16, 2018. UMBC, the 16-seed, was about to face off against the top-seeded Virginia Cavaliers, a team many experts predicted would win the whole tournament.
""He was talking about what he had been through, why he wanted us to win so much,"" Sherburne said. ""That he had been living in Charlotte right down the street [from the arena]. Out of a job. What he had been through with his family.""
Ryan was about to face his favorite childhood team in the same town on the same home court he had been fired from on the exact same day three years earlier.
""You couldn't write the script,"" Ryan's father said of the matchup. ""You couldn't write that as a movie.""
And sitting in the stands was 16-year-old Connor, who had just returned from two months of therapy. As Sherburne listened to his coach, he remembers thinking, ""We really wanted to win for him. That was a big motivation for us.""
By halftime, the game was tied at 21. But when the Retrievers returned to the court, they began firing off an unstoppable barrage of 3-point shots. Virginia, renowned for its vaunted defense, couldn't shut it down.
""We're a team that gets up and down and shoots 3s,"" Sherburne said. ""When you're a small team who's playing a No. 1 team in the country, you've got to be able to make 3s.""
UMBC went on to win 74-54, the first time in tournament history that a 16-seed ousted a No. 1 seed.
But the Cinderella story lasted just one round, on and off the court. UMBC lost its next game against Kansas State, and Connor spiraled again a few days later.
The Odoms resumed their search for a physician who could explain why the OCD kept returning and finally found veteran neurologist Dr. Rosario Trifiletti, who suspected strep might not be the only culprit behind Connor's condition and ordered more extensive blood work.
""It's as if you caught a mental illness,"" Trifiletti said. ""Most children react to infections like a strep throat by getting a fever and feeling ill. But a small percentage of kids react differently and have a sudden behavioral change and develop these characteristics of OCD.""
Trifiletti added that PANDAS is still an emerging diagnosis and there is debate within the medical community about its cause and how to treat it. But Trifiletti believes any infection that can spike a fever can cause PANDAS in a child who is susceptible to it, which is why some doctors are now starting to refer to it simply as PANS, which is short for Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome.
""In Connor, indeed, we found lots of things going on, and we realized there were a lot of infections to treat,"" Trifiletti said.
One of the factors was Lyme disease, which the Odoms believe has been in Connor's system since he was 18 months old.
""He woke up one morning and half his face wasn't moving,"" Lucia said. ""We went to a specialist to try and figure out what it was and they said Bell's palsy. We treated him for 30 days with a steroid and it went away.""
But it hadn't, really. His parents believe the Lyme disease had been lurking in Connor's bloodstream for more than a decade, triggering his OCD along with the strep when he hit puberty.
""This is why nothing worked,"" Lucia said. Trifiletti ""figured out the missing piece.""
""Finally, I have an answer,"" Connor said of his diagnosis. ""I know that my worries are caused, ironically, from germs, but at least I know that I'm not crazy and worrying about nothing.""
Connor said the hard reality of OCD is that once it sets in, it can be very difficult to control. Even though he quickly started an aggressive regimen of medication and supplements to fight the Lyme disease, the Odoms just assumed they were headed to Nashville again.
Except, this time, ""Connor fought it on his own,"" Ryan said. ""That's the first time I've seen him do that. I was so proud of him.""
For Ryan, leading his UMBC team to that historic upset a year ago was nothing compared to Connor's battle with OCD.
""Without a doubt. What we did at UMBC is an upset for the ages -- for now, until somebody else does it. There are always upsets,"" Ryan said. ""When you see your child overcome something this traumatic and this hard, it takes a special person to do that.""
After missing two years of school, Connor is now taking accelerated classes at Oak Hill Academy, a legendary basketball boarding school located in the mountains of southern Virginia where former alums include Jerry Stackhouse, Carmelo Anthony and Rajon Rondo.
Several of Connor's teammates are at least a foot taller than him, including his roommate, whose side of the room looks as perfectly disheveled as one would expect from a 17-year-old. Connor's side, however, is immaculate. Connor might never shake the need to keep everything clean and organized, Trifiletti said; he might have future relapses. But the fact that Connor can now walk into the boy's locker room barefoot and pick through a mound of dirty laundry in search of his shoes, the doctor said, ""is incredible.""
When asked if Connor is at Oak Hill training up to be the next Coach Odom, his grandfather sported a knowing grin.
""There were some really dark days, but there is great balance in life,"" he replied. ""And basketball was the Odom family's anchor. It has kept us afloat.""

Joseph was elevated to the permanent job after winning 20 games that season, but the Colonials finished just 24-42 over the past two seasons. George Washington finished one game out of last place in the Atlantic 10 standings this season, going 9-24 overall and 4-14 in league play.
""This is a difficult day because Maurice has led this program with high integrity and has always been a great representative of George Washington University,"" director of athletics and recreation Tanya Vogel said in a statement. ""He has been a part of our staff for eight seasons, earning a degree and meeting his wife, Kristen, a fellow GW graduate here. We hope they will always feel like a part of our family.
""This decision was necessary because we are not reaching our full potential on the court. Our university leadership and I have high expectations for what this program can achieve in the near future. We will move forward with a national search for our new head coach who will help us get back to competing for Atlantic 10 Championships and being in the conversation for NCAA bids on a regular basis.""
Joseph had been an assistant coach at George Washington under Lonergan, whom he played for at Vermont, from 2011 to 2016.
The 33-year-old Joseph started his playing career at Michigan State under Tom Izzo, but transferred to Vermont after two seasons.

26032466,"Zion Williamson has turned Wednesday's North Carolina-Duke game into the Super Bowl.
Well, it'll cost you the price of a Super Bowl ticket to see the game, at least.
If you're interested in squeezing into Cameron Indoor Stadium to watch the first installment of the legendary rivalry in 2019, you'll have to spend $2,500, the price of the cheapest available ticket. That's just shy of the $2,674 you would have paid on Jan. 27 for the cheapest available ticket to the Feb. 3 Super Bowl, per Kyle Zorn, a marketing strategist for secondary ticket seller TickPick.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
Zion Williamson is the overwhelming favorite to be the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft, according to DraftKings.
One ticket to this week's UNC-Duke game sold for $10,652, per Vivid Seats. Zorn said there is only one other athlete who is comparable to Williamson and his impact on ticket prices: LeBron James after he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers last summer.
Ticket prices for Lakers road games have increased by 125 percent, Zorn said.
""As far as Duke this year, I haven't seen anything like this,"" Zorn said.
The presence of Williamson, the likely No. 1 pick in June's NBA draft, and projected top-five picks RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish has added more pop to the premier rivalry game in college basketball.
""Zion is a different bird. No question about that,"" Tar Heels coach Roy Williams said Tuesday. ""We tried to recruit him very, very hard. He's got a combination of skill set that I've never seen before. There is a lot of attention but he deserves it. He's backed it up.

Some tickets for last season's national title game between Villanova and Michigan were as low as $67. Per Vivid Seats, the average price to attend a North Carolina home game is $70 this season, but the average price for the March 9 rematch against Duke is already at $991.
Zorn said the comparable ticket prices for Wednesday's UNC-Duke game (9 p.m., ESPN) were set about a week before the Super Bowl at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, and the venue size for Wednesday's game -- Cameron Indoor Arena's capacity is 9,314 -- is a significant factor in the skyrocketing prices.
""Between Zion Williamson, a No. 1 ranking and this being one of the biggest rivalries in sports, there's intense demand,"" Zorn said. ""There's also a limited supply of inventory, which is having a major effect on price. Cameron Indoor Stadium has 13 percent the seating capacity of Mercedes-Benz Stadium. When you factor in that the floor seating is reserved for students, you're left with a short supply -- and massive demand.""

26262626,"LSU coach Will Wade says he should be allowed to coach even if he refuses to sit down to discuss his relationship with convicted middleman Christian Dawkins until after the federal government concludes its investigation into college basketball corruption.
""Last week, when the University decided to place me on administrative leave, I accepted the decision without complaint as I knew that they wanted time to reflect on the flurry of media reports,"" Wade said in a statement. ""With the benefit of a week to consider the circumstances, I believe University officials should allow me to resume my duties.""
His request comes a day after a letter surfaced that was sent from Wade's attorney, Michael G. McGovern in New York, to LSU chancellor F. King Alexander, athletic director Joe Alleva and others.
It said that ""upon conclusion of the pending [Southern District of New York] criminal investigation, Coach Wade will be happy to meet with you and LSU's Board of Supervisors and to answer any and all questions you may have.""
Wade's unwillingness to discuss what he said to Dawkins in telephone calls that were intercepted by FBI wiretaps likely means he won't coach in this week's SEC tournament or any of the No. 9 Tigers' games in the upcoming NCAA tournament.
LSU confirmed as much in a statement from its vice president for legal affairs and general counsel.
""Coach Will Wade has yet to deny any wrongdoing to us or publicly,"" Thomas Skinner said. ""Absent that, the university is in a very difficult position with regard to compliance with NCAA requirements, and until Coach Wade talks to university administration about this, he remains suspended. There is a standing offer for him and his attorneys to meet with LSU officials.""
LSU officials suspended Wade and named Tony Benford interim coach on Friday after Wade refused to discuss published reports about his involvement in alleged pay-for-play deals.
""In this case, the simple truth is I have been placed on leave because I exercised my right not to submit to a joint LSU/NCAA interview on the exact same subject matter at issue in an impending federal criminal trial in New York,"" Wade said in the statement. ""My legal counsel advised the University that it would be wholly inappropriate for me, or anyone, to submit to an interview under these circumstances.""
Last week, ESPN and Yahoo Sports reported that in one of the phone calls intercepted by FBI wiretaps, Wade expressed frustration about his inability to close what he described as a ""strong-ass offer"" for a recruit.
According to people familiar with the calls, Wade was frustrated with a handler of current LSU guard Javonte Smart, who was then a top-50 recruit from Baton Rouge.
Smart didn't play in LSU's 80-59 victory over Vanderbilt on Saturday night that clinched the SEC regular-season title for the Tigers. His status for the postseason remains unclear.
""I was thinking last night on this Smart thing,"" Wade told Dawkins during one of the calls. ""I'll be honest with you, I'm [expletive] tired of dealing with the thing. Like I'm just [expletive] sick of dealing with the s---. Like, this should not be that [expletive] complicated.""
""Dude,"" Wade continued during the call, ""I went to [the handler] with a [expletive] strong-ass offer about a month ago. [Expletive] strong.
""The problem was, I know why he didn't take it now. It was [expletive] tilted toward the family a little bit. It was tilted toward taking care of the mom, taking care of the kid. Like it was tilted towards that. Now I know for a fact he didn't explain everything to the mom. I know now, he didn't get enough of the piece of the pie in the deal.
""It was a [expletive] hell of a [expletive] offer. Hell of an offer. ... Especially for a kid who is going to be a two- or three-year kid.""
In a different telephone call with Dawkins, Wade joked that the player would be compensated more than the ""rookie minimum.""
Wade told Dawkins that he had made deals for ""as good of players as him"" that were ""a lot simpler than this.""
Steven Haney, Dawkins' attorney, told ESPN that he plans to subpoena Wade, Arizona's Sean Miller and possibly other coaches to testify in an April 22 federal criminal trial in New York. Dawkins and former Adidas consultant Merl Code are accused of bribing assistant coaches to influence their players to sign with Dawkins' fledgling sports agency once they turned pro.
""Declining to be interviewed was a difficult decision for me, as I would like to cooperate fully with all parties, particularly LSU,"" Wade concluded in his statement. ""To be clear, however, all I've done is follow the prudent advice of counsel to exercise my constitutional rights to due process. Given these facts, I don't believe it is appropriate for me to be relieved of my duties.
""We have a great basketball program made up of excellent student athletes and quality coaches. The players who've given their all for this institution, the students and alumni who are devoted to LSU, and fans all across Louisiana and beyond deserve to see this team fulfill its destiny. I love LSU and everything it stands for. What I'm asking for is the right to do my job while exercising my constitutional rights. I don't think that's too much to ask.""

26171664,"A plane carrying the University of Michigan basketball team in 2017 had already reached the critical speed at which pilots could no longer stop it on the runway. The captain abandoned the takeoff anyway, surprising the pilot in the next seat.
The plane hurtled 950 feet past the end of the runway, tore through a chain-link fence and crossed a paved road before stopping.
The captain's last-second decision to abort the takeoff in the incident might have prevented a disaster, safety officials said Thursday.
""These two pilots did everything right after things started to go very wrong,"" said Robert Sumwalt, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.
In its report on the accident in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, the board determined that a jammed part prevented pilots from tilting the nose of their MD-83 jet upward during takeoff. The pilots, however, had no way of knowing that until they were speeding down the runway at 158 mph, the board concluded.
The 110 passengers and six crew members used emergency chutes to escape, although one slide failed to inflate. One passenger suffered minor injuries.
The plane, operated by Ameristar Charters, was heavily damaged.
After the accident, the pilots faced criticism for aborting the takeoff after the plane reached the speed at which pilots must commit to take off -- or almost certainly overshoot the runway even with heavy braking.
The captain, Mark Radloff, told investigators that when he tried to tilt the plane upward it felt heavy, as if there were a stack of bricks on the nose.
""This thing is not flying,"" Radloff said to Andreas Gruseus, who was instructing Radloff on the plane. Radloff saw a chain-link fence in the distance and didn't think the plane could clear it.
""Abort, abort, abort,"" he called out.
Later, Gruseus told Radloff he wasn't supposed to abandon the takeoff at such a high speed.
""I know, but I had nothing, I had absolutely nothing to get the nose up,"" he said.
Ameristar said the NTSB's 134-page report vindicated Radloff's decision.
""With a different pilot on this airplane, there might have been people hurt or even killed,"" Ameristar vice president Stacy Muth said in an interview. ""All we lost was the airplane.""
The NTSB said the plane was properly maintained, but components in an elevator -- a part that pilots adjust to change the pitch or nose direction -- jammed because the plane was parked outside a hangar for two days during windy weather.
The board recommended that aircraft maker Boeing modify DC-9 and MD-80-series jets to prevent ground wind from causing elevator components to jam.
Investigators also said Boeing should develop procedures to help pilots check for jammed elevators before takeoff. The Ameristar pilots would have needed a boom or to climb on the plane's tail to inspect the parts.
Boeing declined to comment.
The Willow Run Airport, about 30 miles west of Detroit and used mostly for charters and private planes, added a 1,000-foot (300-meter) runoff area during work from 2006 to 2009. The NTSB said the safety feature, which it recommended and the Federal Aviation Administration promoted at many airports, probably prevented a worse outcome for the incident on March 8, 2017.
The Michigan basketball team caught another plane the following day to the Big Ten conference tournament in Washington, D.C. They won the tournament.

Dawkins and former Adidas consultant Merl Code face federal bribery charges in the April trial. They are accused of bribing three former assistant coaches -- Arizona's Emanuel ""Book"" Richardson, Oklahoma State's Lamont Evans and USC's Tony Bland -- to steer players to certain financial advisers and Dawkins' fledgling management company once they turned pro.
Yahoo Sports first reported details about the subpoena notifications.
Richardson, Evans and Bland, who were accused of accepting as much as $22,000 in bribes from Code and Dawkins, reached plea agreements with federal prosecutors. It is unknown whether they will testify at the upcoming trial.
Defense attorneys have not yet decided whether they will subpoena other coaches, including Creighton's Greg McDermott, sources told ESPN.
Dawkins' attorney, Steven Haney of Detroit, told ESPN last month that he anticipated more evidence of widespread recruiting violations, some of which was captured by FBI wiretaps on Dawkins' phone, to be revealed during the April trial.
""I believe there is conduct in this case that is not charged in the indictment and that needs to come out,"" Haney said. ""We want the truth to come out, and it will come out.""
An Outside the Lines analysis of Dawkins' cellphone records from May 3, 2017, to July 2, 2017, shows there were at least 13 phone calls involving a cell number belonging to Sean Miller. The records show that each of the calls Dawkins made to or received from the number associated with Miller lasted at least five minutes.
During the October trial, Brian Bowen Sr., the father of former Louisville signee Brian Bowen II, testified that Dawkins told him that Arizona assistant coach Joe Pasternack offered $50,000 for Bowen to sign with the Wildcats. Pasternack is now the head coach at UC Santa Barbara.
Defense attorneys during the trial also suggested that Arizona offered -- or was prepared to offer -- $150,000 for current North Carolina player Nassir Little to sign with the Wildcats. The government and defense attorneys agreed that the money wasn't requested on behalf of Little's family.
ESPN reported in February 2018 that Dawkins and Miller had discussions about a $100,000 payment that ensured that star center Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 pick in June's NBA draft, signed with the Wildcats from the Class of 2017.
Earlier this month, Arizona initiated the process to fire men's basketball assistant coach Mark Phelps while suspending him indefinitely, the school said in a statement.
Sources told ESPN that Phelps is accused of a violation regarding former Arizona recruit Shareef O'Neal's academic transcripts. O'Neal, the son of former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal, was committed to the Wildcats in 2017 before signing with UCLA.
Code, Dawkins and Adidas executive James Gatto were convicted of federal fraud charges in October for funneling money from Adidas to the parents and/or guardians of high-profile recruits to steer them to sign with Adidas-sponsored schools, including Kansas, Louisville and NC State. They are scheduled for sentencing March 5.
Arizona officials have denied multiple open-records requests from ESPN for any subpoenas the university received from the federal government for information and grand jury testimony related to the investigation. They also have declined to provide Miller's cellphone records and his correspondence with university officials. They repeatedly cited ""the balancing test established by the Arizona courts to protect the best interests of the state"" in their refusal to release the records.
Evidence presented by the government during the October trial revealed Dawkins also claimed to be closely associated with Rawle Alkins, who was a two-year starting guard at Arizona before turning pro after last season. He went undrafted and signed a two-way deal with the Chicago Bulls in July.
In a Sept. 5, 2017, email Dawkins sent to his business partner, Munish Sood, he detailed payments he planned to make to Alkins and his cousin, Rodney Labossiere. Labossiere, who grew up with Alkins in New York, moved to Tucson, Arizona, in September 2017, according to property records reviewed by Outside the Lines.
Dawkins wrote that he planned to pay Alkins $2,500 per month from September 2017 through April 2018 -- when Alkins was still playing for Arizona -- plus $30,000 in travel expenses for his family. He also wanted to give Labossiere a four-year deal to work as a manager for his sports management company.
""Rodney will get 25% of net income we generate from Rawle as well as additional players he brings in moving forward,"" Dawkins wrote. ""Rodney has a bonus structure in his contract as well for delivering players at [$]10,000 for a first round pick. $2,000 for a second round pick.""
Dawkins' phone records show that there were 33 calls made to a number belonging to Labossiere from May 7, 2017, through July 2, 2017.
Dawkins also had at least three phone calls with a cellphone number belonging to Wade, each of which occurred between June 19, 2017, and June 30, 2017, after Bowen II committed to Louisville.
Wade previously told the SEC Network that he never discussed with Dawkins providing improper benefits to a player.
""What I will say is that I'm very proud of everything I've done as the LSU basketball coach,"" Wade said. ""I have never, ever done any business of any kind with Christian Dawkins.""
Casey Donnelly, one of Gatto's attorneys, tried to introduce a wiretap recording of a call between Wade and Dawkins during the October trial. She did not provide a date of the call. According to the transcript that Donnelly read without the jury present, Dawkins called Wade and inquired about LSU's interest in Balsa Koprivica, a 7-foot center from Montverde, Florida.
""So you said to me in Atlanta there was a 2019 kid I wanted to recruit, they can get him to LSU, you would have funded,"" Dawkins told Wade, according to Donnelly. ""Would you want Balsa?""
""Oh, the big kid?"" Wade asked.
""Yeah,"" Dawkins confirmed.
""OK. But there's other [expletive] involved in it,"" Wade said. ""I have got to shut my door. ... Here's my thing: I can get you what you need, but it's got to work.""
On June 21, 2017, Koprivica tweeted: ""Blessed to say I have received an offer from LSU.""

26211669,"Duke's regular season ended Saturday night with a 79-70 loss to North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
The good news: Injured star freshman Zion Williamson is set for his first full practice Monday and is still expected to rejoin the team for its first ACC tournament game Thursday.
The bad: Starting center Marques Bolden suffered a sprained left MCL just minutes into Saturday's contest, and his status going forward is unknown.
Williamson missed his fifth full game Saturday because of a sprained right knee suffered when his sneaker split during Duke's first matchup against the Tar Heels last month, also a Blue Devils loss. Coach Mike Krzyzewski has been cautious with the projected No. 1 overall draft pick's return, but he said after Saturday night's tilt that Williamson is set to take part in his first full practice Monday.
Freshman Coby White scored 21 points and third-ranked North Carolina hung on late to beat fourth-ranked Duke 79-70 on Saturday to clinch a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season championship.
Duke's Zion Williamson and RJ Barrett are the only freshmen to be named Wooden Award finalists for the men's honor, while Mississippi State's Teaira McCowan stands out among the women's contenders.
""I think we'll get Zion back for Thursday,"" Krzyzewski said. ""He worked out this morning -- again, no contact -- but Monday, there will be. Hopefully, we'll get a couple good days of practice where he can be 5-on-5, and then see how that goes. But the way he looks right now, I think it's just a matter of getting in shape, getting in game shape, and going forward.""
Williamson is averaging 21.6 points and 8.8 rebounds this season. Duke (26-5, 14-4 ACC) is 3-3 in the nearly six full games without him.
Krzyzewski doesn't think his team will need time to adjust once Williamson returns.
""These guys will react quickly,"" he said. ""It depends on Zion, his shape, but I think they'll respond real quick.""
Duke junior Marques Bolden has to be helped off the court after going down with a left leg injury.
Bolden, a starter, fell into the basket support and injured his left knee while picking up a foul on a block attempt at the 17-minute, 27-second mark of the opening half. He stayed down for several minutes before needing assistance to leave the court.
Duke announced just ahead of the second-half tipoff that Bolden would not return. The junior entered the game averaging 6.0 points and 4.8 rebounds.
Krzyzewski said he is unsure of the severity of the injury.
""I don't know degree, the level, 1, 2 ... I don't know that,"" he said. ""But it's not an ACL, so it's good for that kid.""
Krzyzewski also said that Duke has prepared to fill Bolden's role, unlike what happened with Williamson.
""Marques had more of a limited role than Zion or Tre [Jones] would have,"" the coach said. ""We were good today.""

Next up for Williams: Third-seeded Tennessee takes on the Mississippi State Bulldogs, the No. 6 seed, in the SEC Tournament's quarterfinals (9 p.m. ET on SEC Network).
JONATHAN GIVONY, ESPN DRAFT EXPERT: He's one of the smartest, toughest and most productive players in college basketball. He's a phenomenal passer, a versatile defender and has a soft touch. If he were 2 inches taller, we'd be talking lottery.
WILLIAMS: I never understood the height thing. I've thought of it as a competitive mindset. That's how I grew up. It's the same way if a guard is 5-foot-10 going against guys that are 6-foot-6; it doesn't matter if he's producing.
GIVONY: Because of his size and below-the-rim style, he's compared to Chuck Hayes and Udonis Haslem. But he has been more productive than them in college. He's not as long, but you hear Draymond comparisons too.
WILLIAMS: If you look at those guys, they've got something in common: They're winners. You look at Draymond or PJ Tucker, their speed allows them to beat bigger defenders off the dribble, and they're versatile on defense. For me, I definitely can guard multiple positions but can improve, especially on the perimeter.
GIVONY: Going into workouts, he needs to show teams that he can shoot it consistently from NBA range. He has it in him, but for whatever reason, he takes just 1.3 3s per game. But he's an 83 percent free throw shooter. That's an encouraging sign.
WILLIAMS: Why settle for the deep 3 when I can score within 17 feet or drive aggressively and put a foul on a guy? Freshman year, it started inside with hooks; sophomore year, midrange and turnarounds; and this year I've extended to the college [3] and farther out. But I want to hear I have to improve in a certain area. It'll help me become a more complete player.
GIVONY: Shooting 3s is going to have to become a big part of his game because he's not going to be able to rely on bullying guys in the paint and getting to the free throw line.
WILLIAMS: Whatever my team needs. You don't have teams adapt to you. There are only certain guys [you do that for]. I'll do what it takes to win.

26172472,"FBI wiretaps intercepted telephone calls between LSU coach Will Wade and aspiring business manager Christian Dawkins, in which Wade expressed frustration about his inability to close what he described as a ""strong-ass offer"" for a recruit, sources told ESPN on Thursday.
Yahoo Sports first reported details about the contents of one of the telephone calls on Thursday.
ESPN has independently verified the calls between Dawkins and Wade, which occurred in 2017, when the FBI was monitoring one of Dawkins' cellphones as part of the federal government's clandestine investigation into college basketball corruption.
According to people familiar with the calls, Wade was frustrated with a handler of current LSU guard Javonte Smart, who was then a top-50 recruit from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
""I was thinking last night on this Smart thing,"" Wade told Dawkins during one of the calls. ""I'll be honest with you, I'm [expletive] tired of dealing with the thing. Like I'm just [expletive] sick of dealing with the s---. Like, this should not be that [expletive] complicated.
""Dude,"" Wade continued during the call, ""I went to [the handler] with a [expletive] strong-ass offer about a month ago. [Expletive] strong.
""The problem was, I know why he didn't take it now. It was [expletive] tilted toward the family a little bit. It was tilted toward taking care of the mom, taking care of the kid. Like it was tilted towards that. Now I know for a fact he didn't explain everything to the mom. I know now, he didn't get enough of the piece of the pie in the deal.""
""It was a [expletive] hell of a [expletive] offer,"" Wade continued. ""Hell of an offer. ... Especially for a kid who is going to be a two- or three-year kid.""
The federal government on Thursday filed a superseding indictment against former Adidas consultant Merl Code and aspiring business manager Christian Dawkins. The superseding indictment included additional allegations but no new criminal charges.
Ex-Adidas executive James Gatto, ex-Adidas consultant Merl Code and aspiring sports business manager Christian Dawkins were sentenced Tuesday after being convicted of pay-for-play schemes to steer recruits to Adidas-sponsored college basketball programs.
Attorneys representing the two remaining defendants in a federal criminal trial involving college basketball corruption have notified representatives of Arizona's Sean Miller and LSU's Will Wade that they will be subpoenaed to testify at the April trial.
In a different telephone call with Dawkins, Wade joked that the player would be compensated more than the ""rookie minimum.""
Wade told Dawkins that he had made deals for ""as good of players as him"" that were ""a lot simpler than this.""
Wade, 36, has guided No. 10 LSU to a 25-5 overall, 15-2 SEC record this season. The Tigers are tied with No. 5 Tennessee for first place in the SEC with one regular-season game remaining.
Asked about the report Thursday at an LSU luncheon, Wade said he had yet to read it.
""I have to read it and look at it and from there we'll move forward as we need to,"" the coach said.
Smart, a freshman, is averaging 11.5 points and 2.5 assists. He was ranked the No. 31 player in the country in the 2018 ESPN 100.
Dawkins, a former runner for NBA agent Andy Miller, was sentenced to six months in federal prison on Tuesday after he was convicted on felony charges for his role in a pay-for-play scheme to funnel money from Adidas to the families of high-profile recruits to ensure they signed with Adidas-sponsored schools, including Kansas, Louisville and NC State.
Former Adidas executive James Gatto was sentenced to nine months in prison, and former Adidas consultant Merl Code was sentenced to six months. Attorneys for the men said they intended to appeal the convictions.
Code and Dawkins are also defendants in an April 22 federal criminal case, in which prosecutors have accused them of bribing three former assistant coaches -- Arizona's Emanuel ""Book"" Richardson, USC's Tony Bland and Oklahoma State's Lamont Evans -- to steer their players to Dawkins' fledgling sports management agency and certain financial planners once they turned pro.
Dawkins' attorney, Steven Haney of Detroit, notified Wade's and Arizona coach Sean Miller's attorneys that he planned to subpoena the coaches to testify at the April trial.
Outside the Lines previously reported that Wade and Dawkins had at least three phone calls between June 19, 2017, and June 30, 2017.
LSU officials previously told ESPN that phone records for Wade's university-issued cellphone didn't include any calls to cell numbers assigned to Dawkins.
Last week, LSU officials also told ESPN that the university hadn't received any correspondence from the U.S. Justice Department or the NCAA regarding its men's basketball program.
During the October federal criminal trial, defense attorneys unsuccessfully tried to introduce into evidence a call between Dawkins and Wade, in which they discussed 2019 recruit Balsa Koprivica, who is committed to Florida State.
""So you said to me ... there was a 2019 kid I wanted to recruit, they can get him to LSU, you would have funded,"" Dawkins told Wade. ""Would you want Balsa?""
""Oh, the big kid?"" Wade said.
Dawkins confirmed he was talking about Koprivica.
""OK, but there is other [expletive] involved in it,"" Wade said. ""I have got to shut my door ....""

26146854,"DURHAM, N.C. -- Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski remains doubtful star Zion Williamson will be on the court Saturday vs. North Carolina, but he offered his most fervent assurance that the freshman and possible player of the year will return to action soon.
Williamson missed his fourth straight game with a knee injury Tuesday night, and Duke struggled to get past Wake Forest in a 71-70 win that would've marked a likely send-off from Cameron Indoor Stadium for the star freshman. The good news, Krzyzewski said, is that Williamson was able to do some basketball work during practice, and his return is imminent.
Playing without star freshman Zion Williamson, the Blue Devils held on to beat Wake Forest 71-70 on Tuesday after Chaundee Brown's jumper rimmed out at the buzzer. It was Duke's 10th straight win in the in-state series.
""He's getting more confidence, and we just have to get him in shape,"" Krzyzewski said. ""I don't think he'll be ready for [UNC] ... but I would be surprised if he wasn't ready by the ACC tournament.""
Krzyzewski downplayed more specifics, but Tuesday was his most emphatic assurance that Williamson would, in fact, return to the Duke lineup. In the aftermath of the injury -- caused by a blown-out sneaker -- some wondered if Williamson should sit out the rest of the way to preserve his draft stock. That won't be the case, Krzyzewski said.
""Not assume, we are [getting him back],"" he said.
Williamson was hurt seconds into Duke's first game against North Carolina, a blowout home loss, and the Blue Devils have struggled on both sides of the court at times without him.
An all-access series documenting the Blue Devils' preparation for the 2018-19 season, exclusively on ESPN+. Watch on ESPN+
Those problems were on full display Tuesday, as Cam Reddish was in early foul trouble, and RJ Barrett essentially served as Duke's only true scoring threat. At one point, Wake led by as many as 10, and it was only a pair of misses near the basket at the end that allowed Duke to escape with the win.
""We're not as good as we are with him -- that's the first thing,"" Krzyzewski said. ""You can't put together a well-oiled machine here in a couple practices to play in this conference at a level when you lose a kid like that. There is no kid like that. But our guys have fought.""
That was the resonant message from others Tuesday, too. Yes, this team looks much different without Williamson, but the Blue Devils are looking at this stretch without him as a proving ground.
Paul Pierce and Brian Windhorst discuss whether Zion Williamson will play for Duke in March while recovering from his knee injury.
""I thought we needed it,"" Reddish said. ""We needed to take a few losses to keep us humble and working and fighting. Hopefully, he comes back. And if he doesn't, we're a team full of fighters.""
They aren't a team full of scorers, though, and Krzyzewski said he's enthusiastic about his star's impending return and its potential impact on the Duke offense.
""He'd love to play Saturday, too, if he's ready,"" Krzyzewski said. ""He'll be in some basketball workouts now. That's a really good sign for us. For me, it's a great sign.""
As for the long-term impact of these past few games, Krzyzewski said he wasn't concerned about Duke's tournament seeding, noting that the Blue Devils have played Virginia twice and will have done the same with North Carolina by week's end. And if Williamson isn't on the court, they'll have had all four of their star freshmen in action for just half their ACC games.
""Playing with not a full deck has been very difficult,"" he said. ""We thought it was going to be easier.""

It's Duke/North Carolina, Part II. Tell us how this is going to go if Zion Williamson plays ... and if he doesn't.Jeff Borzello, college basketball insider: I'm not sure it matters on Saturday. I guess it'll be closer if Zion suits up in Chapel Hill, but I think North Carolina wins either way. If he doesn't play -- and Mike Krzyzewski's comments make that appear the likelier scenario -- I think the Blue Devils are really going to struggle. They're a thoroughly average team without Zion and one that got steamrollered by North Carolina in Durham just two weeks ago. The Tar Heels dominated Duke in the post behind Luke Maye, Cam Johnson and Garrison Brooks, and that seems likely to happen again. At the other end, Duke hasn't gotten consistent offense from anyone not named RJ Barrett, which could be an issue against a team that loves to push the tempo and put up points.Coby White and UNC face RJ Barrett and Duke on Saturday. Can the Tar Heels pull off the season sweep? Lance King/Getty ImagesMyron Medcalf, senior college basketball writer: Tough question. You can't rely on the analytics for everything, but Duke without Williamson is a team that falls in love with the 3-pointer (42 percent of its attempts compared with 35 percent with Williamson available) and relies on Barrett's straight-line drives. The Blue Devils are just easier to figure out, and that's what I think North Carolina will do (again) in a second win if Williamson doesn't play because, as Jeff said, Duke isn't really built to stop UNC in the paint without Williamson. If he plays, then Duke wins. Why? Because he's the ultimate playmaker who fixes the flaws that were exposed (defense around the rim, post production, poor shot selection) in the first game.Editor's PicksBubble Watch: Which teams could be left outHere's your updated source for all of the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.Power Rankings: What do the committee's power ranks look like?Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?1 RelatedJohn Gasaway, college basketball writer: This is going to go swimmingly for Duke if Zion plays. He changes the Blue Devils for the better on both offense and defense. That first part requires no further explanation, one surmises, but on D the freshman is a disruptor and a highly mobile wall of shot-changing menace. Fueled by Williamson's return and, no less, by a desire to even the score after the game in Durham, Duke wins if Zion comes back. If not, this does not go well for the Blue Devils.

Fill out your brackets
Jordan Schultz, insider/analyst: Duke is winning this game, with or without Zion. As poorly as the Blue Devils played in a near upset loss to Wake, they still received tremendous production from Barrett, whose 28 points helped him pass Marvin Bagley III for most ever by a Duke freshman. Assuming Williamson can't go, look for Coach K to once again run everything through Barrett, isolating him on the wings with flat sets that allow him to work out against a terrific Heels defense. We also should expect more from uber-talented Cam Reddish, who already hit Carolina for a career-high 27 points in Durham. If Zion does play, however, expect a heavy dose of post-ups and highlight-reel plays considering this will be the only time the prodigious future No. 1 pick ever plays in the Dean Dome. Either way, an angry Duke team wins what should be an excellent game.And then immediately after, it's Michigan vs. Michigan State from East Lansing. You expecting a Spartans sweep?Medcalf: I just want to be there. The Breslin Center is just a wild place, especially when that bass player in the school's band gets going. It'll be crazy this weekend. And I think that will be the difference in a game that will feature two teams hoping to get healthier before the NCAA tournament arrives. I just don't see Cassius Winston, who has been a hero and Wooden Award contender despite his ongoing bout with knee tendinitis, falling short in this season finale against his team's chief rival. Ain't happening. Michigan State gets the sweep.Borzello: Man, this is a tough game to read. First, it doesn't sound like either team is going to be healthy. Charles Matthews has missed two games in a row for Michigan, and John Beilein didn't sound optimistic that Matthews would play on Saturday. For Sparty, Nick Ward is still hurt and Kyle Ahrens also missed the last game. Michigan State goes through stretches where it struggles to score due to its lack of options, and that theoretically will be magnified against an elite defensive unit like the Wolverines. That said, this is basically the same team that went into Ann Arbor -- with Matthews playing 28 minutes -- and beat Michigan by seven two weekends ago. In that one, it was all Winston. He had 27 points and eight assists and outplayed his counterpart, Zavier Simpson. I think that happens again and Michigan State gets the sweep.Gasaway: Yes, the Spartans will sweep Michigan after going 0-2 against Indiana. How perfect is that? In the first game, Michigan State did what you're not supposed to be able to do against the Wolverines. Tom Izzo's guys attacked in the paint, and it worked beautifully. No Big Ten opponent has scored as efficiently against Michigan as did the Spartans (1.23 points per possession), and no Big Ten opponent has shot anywhere near as well inside the arc (68 percent). True, Michigan State took better care of the ball than UM, which we can safely class as a true freak occurrence. Still, I like MSU's chances in East Lansing. Schultz: I do not. Michigan was uncharacteristically locked up by the rugged Spartans defense in Ann Arbor, going 7-for-26 (26.9 percent) from 3 while amassing just six total assists. True, Sparty is elite on both ends -- top 10 in offensive and defensive efficiency, per KenPom -- but the Wolverines have more firepower and once again will not have to worry about Ward, who continues to be sidelined with a fractured hand. The X factor for John Beilein & Co. is Matthews, if he plays. When he plays well and is confident shooting it, Michigan becomes much harder to guard, because Simpson and Jordan Poole are both deft at creating their own offense, as well. Matthews -- who went 1-8 with 4 points in the first MSU game -- must discover his stroke in this one. I'm betting that he will and, in turn, that the Maize and Blue will steal a tight one on the road.You are forced to watch every minute of one and only one 2019 conference tournament. Which one are you picking, and why? (Ivy League mini-tournament not allowed):Borzello: No naps? I'm going to be at the Big East tournament, so I'll leave that one out. If literally every second has to be watched, I think you have to avoid leagues with double byes. If you choose the ACC, you're saying you want to watch Wake Forest or Georgia Tech or Pittsburgh twice in 24 hours. The Big Ten actually has interesting lower seeds, but still, no. The SEC has you grinding through two games involving Texas A&M or Missouri or something. Meh. I'll go with the Big 12. There's a ton at stake heading into Kansas City and fascinating storylines abound. Oklahoma, TCU and Texas all still have work to do to feel comfortable heading into Selection Sunday, so those opening-round games are interesting. Does Kansas bounce back after seeing its streak end Tuesday night? Does Texas Tech stay hot? Can Iowa State stop losing? Will Kansas State start getting national respect? I'm all-in on the Big 12 next week.Medcalf: Oh, man. Borzello's pick makes sense. The Big 12 is always fun and it's in Kansas City, where you can just walk across the street to the Power and Light District and party with Iowa State fans after the games. But I'll take the SEC. I mean, Tom Crean in the opening round, where Georgia might score 98 points (win over Texas on Jan. 26) or 39 points (Wednesday loss to Missouri)? He might punt a basketball into the stands before halftime. Mizzou's Jordan Geist taking 30 shots because why not? Can Billy Kennedy save his job? All of that before we even get to LSU, Kentucky and Tennessee? I'll take it. I'd love to watch everything that happens at the SEC tournament, including Frank Martin and Bruce Pearl possibly pulling off upsets and giving us the best postgame interviews of the week.Gasaway: Is this even up for discussion? Absolutely the Pac-12 tournament.

Jeff Borzello, college basketball insider: I'm not sure it matters on Saturday. I guess it'll be closer if Zion suits up in Chapel Hill, but I think North Carolina wins either way. If he doesn't play -- and Mike Krzyzewski's comments make that appear the likelier scenario -- I think the Blue Devils are really going to struggle. They're a thoroughly average team without Zion and one that got steamrollered by North Carolina in Durham just two weeks ago. The Tar Heels dominated Duke in the post behind Luke Maye, Cam Johnson and Garrison Brooks, and that seems likely to happen again. At the other end, Duke hasn't gotten consistent offense from anyone not named RJ Barrett, which could be an issue against a team that loves to push the tempo and put up points.
Myron Medcalf, senior college basketball writer: Tough question. You can't rely on the analytics for everything, but Duke without Williamson is a team that falls in love with the 3-pointer (42 percent of its attempts compared with 35 percent with Williamson available) and relies on Barrett's straight-line drives. The Blue Devils are just easier to figure out, and that's what I think North Carolina will do (again) in a second win if Williamson doesn't play because, as Jeff said, Duke isn't really built to stop UNC in the paint without Williamson. If he plays, then Duke wins. Why? Because he's the ultimate playmaker who fixes the flaws that were exposed (defense around the rim, post production, poor shot selection) in the first game.
Here's your updated source for all of the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
John Gasaway, college basketball writer: This is going to go swimmingly for Duke if Zion plays. He changes the Blue Devils for the better on both offense and defense. That first part requires no further explanation, one surmises, but on D the freshman is a disruptor and a highly mobile wall of shot-changing menace. Fueled by Williamson's return and, no less, by a desire to even the score after the game in Durham, Duke wins if Zion comes back. If not, this does not go well for the Blue Devils. Winning in Chapel Hill is a taller order than recording a home victory against Wake Forest.

Jordan Schultz, insider/analyst: Duke is winning this game, with or without Zion. As poorly as the Blue Devils played in a near upset loss to Wake, they still received tremendous production from Barrett, whose 28 points helped him pass Marvin Bagley III for most ever by a Duke freshman. Assuming Williamson can't go, look for Coach K to once again run everything through Barrett, isolating him on the wings with flat sets that allow him to work out against a terrific Heels defense. We also should expect more from uber-talented Cam Reddish, who already hit Carolina for a career-high 27 points in Durham. If Zion does play, however, expect a heavy dose of post-ups and highlight-reel plays considering this will be the only time the prodigious future No. 1 pick ever plays in the Dean Dome. Either way, an angry Duke team wins what should be an excellent game.
Medcalf: I just want to be there. The Breslin Center is just a wild place, especially when that bass player in the school's band gets going. It'll be crazy this weekend. And I think that will be the difference in a game that will feature two teams hoping to get healthier before the NCAA tournament arrives. I just don't see Cassius Winston, who has been a hero and Wooden Award contender despite his ongoing bout with knee tendinitis, falling short in this season finale against his team's chief rival. Ain't happening. Michigan State gets the sweep.
Borzello: Man, this is a tough game to read. First, it doesn't sound like either team is going to be healthy. Charles Matthews has missed two games in a row for Michigan, and John Beilein didn't sound optimistic that Matthews would play on Saturday. For Sparty, Nick Ward is still hurt and Kyle Ahrens also missed the last game. Michigan State goes through stretches where it struggles to score due to its lack of options, and that theoretically will be magnified against an elite defensive unit like the Wolverines. That said, this is basically the same team that went into Ann Arbor -- with Matthews playing 28 minutes -- and beat Michigan by seven two weekends ago. In that one, it was all Winston. He had 27 points and eight assists and outplayed his counterpart, Zavier Simpson. I think that happens again and Michigan State gets the sweep.
Gasaway: Yes, the Spartans will sweep Michigan after going 0-2 against Indiana. How perfect is that? In the first game, Michigan State did what you're not supposed to be able to do against the Wolverines. Tom Izzo's guys attacked in the paint, and it worked beautifully. No Big Ten opponent has scored as efficiently against Michigan as did the Spartans (1.23 points per possession), and no Big Ten opponent has shot anywhere near as well inside the arc (68 percent). True, Michigan State took better care of the ball than UM, which we can safely class as a true freak occurrence. Still, I like MSU's chances in East Lansing. 
Schultz: I do not. Michigan was uncharacteristically locked up by the rugged Spartans defense in Ann Arbor, going 7-for-26 (26.9 percent) from 3 while amassing just six total assists. True, Sparty is elite on both ends -- top 10 in offensive and defensive efficiency, per KenPom -- but the Wolverines have more firepower and once again will not have to worry about Ward, who continues to be sidelined with a fractured hand. The X factor for John Beilein & Co. is Matthews, if he plays. When he plays well and is confident shooting it, Michigan becomes much harder to guard, because Simpson and Jordan Poole are both deft at creating their own offense, as well. Matthews -- who went 1-8 with 4 points in the first MSU game -- must discover his stroke in this one. I'm betting that he will and, in turn, that the Maize and Blue will steal a tight one on the road.
Borzello: No naps? I'm going to be at the Big East tournament, so I'll leave that one out. If literally every second has to be watched, I think you have to avoid leagues with double byes. If you choose the ACC, you're saying you want to watch Wake Forest or Georgia Tech or Pittsburgh twice in 24 hours. The Big Ten actually has interesting lower seeds, but still, no. The SEC has you grinding through two games involving Texas A&M or Missouri or something. Meh. I'll go with the Big 12. There's a ton at stake heading into Kansas City and fascinating storylines abound. Oklahoma, TCU and Texas all still have work to do to feel comfortable heading into Selection Sunday, so those opening-round games are interesting. Does Kansas bounce back after seeing its streak end Tuesday night? Does Texas Tech stay hot? Can Iowa State stop losing? Will Kansas State start getting national respect? I'm all-in on the Big 12 next week.
Medcalf: Oh, man. Borzello's pick makes sense. The Big 12 is always fun and it's in Kansas City, where you can just walk across the street to the Power and Light District and party with Iowa State fans after the games. But I'll take the SEC. I mean, Tom Crean in the opening round, where Georgia might score 98 points (win over Texas on Jan. 26) or 39 points (Wednesday loss to Missouri)? He might punt a basketball into the stands before halftime. Mizzou's Jordan Geist taking 30 shots because why not? Can Billy Kennedy save his job? All of that before we even get to LSU, Kentucky and Tennessee? I'll take it. I'd love to watch everything that happens at the SEC tournament, including Frank Martin and Bruce Pearl possibly pulling off upsets and giving us the best postgame interviews of the week.
Gasaway: Is this even up for discussion? Absolutely the Pac-12 tournament. One, no one in the conference not named ""Washington"" or, possibly, ""Arizona State"" (and even that second one is very iffy) is getting anywhere near the NCAA tournament without an automatic bid. These teams will all be playing like hungry carnivores, not like the ""let's just stay healthy"" locks in certain other major conferences. Two, these completely off-bubble teams can, paradoxically, win a game or possibly even two if they do get in the field of 68: Utah's offense is excellent, and the two Oregon teams are both playing quite well without anyone much noticing. Three, UW's Matisse Thybulle is possibly Division I's most entertaining player who's also healthy. Last thing, 12-team tournaments feel like less of a slog on the first day than your true mega-leagues. I'd love to be there with my Maui Jim sunglasses celebrating the conference of champions.
Schultz: This is relatively easy for me, if hardly conventional, but I love the OVC, mainly because Belmont and Murray State each have an All-America candidate. We all know about Racers all-world point guard Ja Morant, who is arguably the best player -- and highlight -- in the country, save for Mr. Williamson.

26019284,"Why should the NBA have all the All-Star fun?
This week, we're hypothesizing what a collegiate all-star team would look like, if created in the NBA's classic (and former) East vs. West style.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
Here's your updated source for all of the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
To make the geography work for our hypothetical 2018-19 college all-star game, we split the Big 12, Big Ten, Big East and American Athletic Conference down the middle -- Wisconsin and Illinois are part of the West, for example -- with the goal of creating equally stacked rosters.
Introducing our college all-stars:
Note: What's Real, What's Fake will return next Monday.
The top big man for the West squad is averaging 18.4 points, 10.5 rebounds, 1.2 blocks and 1.0 steals per game. But he has also become a fluid passer who is leading his team with 4.8 assists per game.
Don't know the name? Well, you will soon. The 6-foot-8 San Jose State transfer is averaging 16.7 PPG, 8.2 RPG and 3.0 BPG for a Gonzaga squad that has rear-naked-choked the entire West Coast Conference.
In Mountain West play, he has been unstoppable for Nevada. He has connected on 44 percent of his 3-pointers, 53 percent of his shots inside the arc and 70 percent of his free throws.
The Texas Tech star will be a first-round pick this summer. The Red Raiders hold opponents to just 84 points per 100 possessions when he's on the floor.
My goodness, this backcourt ain't fair. Yeah, the West has Howard, the Marquette star who has scored 45 points or more three times this season.
Your all-star team is probably in good shape if Lawson (19.2 PPG, 10.3 RPG) is coming off your bench.
The West has this potential first-team All-American (20.3 PPG, 6.5 RPG) coming off its bench, too.
Houston's star, who has made 40 percent of his 3-point attempts in AAC play (and has 71 triples overall), is the perfect reserve for this squad.
At 19.0 PPG for Nevada, he's a great spark off the bench.
Iowa State's stabilizer (19.0 PPG, 5.5 RPG) is a 38 percent shooter from the 3-point line.
He's doing some of his best work at Gonzaga, which boasts the No. 1 offense, per KenPom. This all-star team would put up NBA Jam numbers with Few as its coach.
He's the poster child for entering your name in the NBA draft and then making the smart decision to come back to school if it's a good move for your career. The 6-8 Washington had 23 points, five rebounds, two steals and two blocks in Saturday's win over then-No. 1 Tennessee.
Tennessee's star is the reigning SEC Player of the Year. And with his numbers this year (19.3, 7.4 RPG), he could win the award again.
How will the West handle this frontcourt? Williamson, the projected No. 1 pick, playing the 3 on this team? Good luck.
Purdue is a Big Ten title contender because of Edwards, who has dropped 20 points or more in 19 games this year.
His high-flying plays with Williamson would break the internet. His numbers (24.3 PPG, 10.2 APG) could break records this season.
Barrett is a projected top-three pick in this summer's NBA draft. You know who he is.
Virginia's best NBA prospect is averaging 15.0 PPG and connecting on 46 percent of his 3-point attempts.
The Michigan State guard carries a heavy load for a Spartans team that averages 114 points per 100 possessions when he's on the floor.
Louisville's 6-8 forward is averaging 17.5 PPG and connecting on 38 percent of his 3-point attempts.
The Cincinnati star is averaging 19.0 PPG and is one of America's most underrated players.
He's coaching the favorite to win the national title, a team with three potential top-five picks in this summer's NBA draft. He would mold this NBA prospect-stacked squad into a juggernaut as well.

26254503,"Jay Wright, who guided Villanova to its fifth regular-season conference title in six seasons, was named Big East coach of the year for the sixth time. Georgetown guard James Akinjo was voted freshmen of the year. All awards were voted on by the league's head coaches.
The 5-foot-11 Howard was averaging 25 points per game entering the Big East tournament, which began Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The junior from Arizona also leads the Big East in 3-pointers made with 112, and he shot 41.4 percent from beyond the arc. Howard also is a finalist for the Wooden Award, given to the national player of the year.
Howard is the second Marquette player to be named Big East player of the year, joining Jae Crowder, who won the award in 2011-12.
Wright led Villanova to a 22-9 record after losing four players off last season's national championship team to the NBA draft.
Akinjo was averaging 13.3 points and 5.4 assists per game, and he is the first Georgetown player to win the frosh award since Greg Monroe in 2008-09.

26255366,"Wildcats coach Bruce Weber said after Wednesday's practice at Sprint Center that the 6-foot-10 Wade would spend most of his time this week getting treatment. The hope is that Wade will be ready for next week's NCAA tournament, though Weber said he could not promise anything.
Wade is averaging 12.9 points and 6.2 rebounds for the Wildcats, who are the No. 1 seed in Kansas City after tying Texas Tech for the regular-season conference title.
The Wildcats did get some good news in that Cartier Diarra, who has missed several weeks after hand surgery, is expected to be available for their quarterfinal on Thursday.

26045948,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Longtime Syracuse basketball coach Jim Boeheim struck and killed a man along an interstate highway late Wednesday night as he tried to avoid hitting the man's disabled vehicle, police say.
Syracuse police say 51-year-old Jorge Jimenez was an occupant in a black Dodge Charger with three others when they apparently lost control on a patch of ice and hit a guardrail before midnight Wednesday on I-690 in Syracuse.
Boeheim struck Jimenez with his GMC Acadia while trying to avoid the disabled car, which was resting perpendicular on the darkened highway. The group had been heading toward the median for safety. Jimenez was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Another man in the group suffered minor injuries in the accident, police said.
""I am heartbroken that a member of our community died as the result of last night's accident,"" Boeheim said in a prepared statement. The 74-year-old Basketball Hall of Fame coach said he and his wife Juli ""extend our deepest sympathies to the Jimenez family.""
He said he would not comment further ""out of respect for those involved.""
Police said Boeheim has been cooperating with the investigation. He even used his cellphone light to warn other drivers of the disabled car after the accident, police said.
""At this time we have no reason to believe that there are criminal charges that will be coming for anyone,"" Syracuse Police Chief Kenton T. Buckner said at a news conference.
Police said sobriety tests administered to Boeheim and the unidentified driver of the other vehicle were negative for any signs of impairment. Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said he has known Boeheim for 40 years and that the coach does not drink.
No tickets have been issued to Boeheim at this time and the investigation is continuing.
""This story obviously is newsworthy because of the notoriety of the coach,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""But this is the loss of a human being. It was an accident in the purest sense of the word.""
Jimenez's daughter told the Post-Standard he was with friends buying cigarettes when he was killed. Yurisandy Jimenez Arrastre described her father -- a native of Cuba who lived in the United States for 20 years -- as a family man who loved to cook and tell jokes.
""My father was a man who was very sociable, very happy. He loved to help everybody without question,"" Arrastre told the newspaper in Spanish. ""He loved having friends.""
Just hours before, Boeheim's team defeated 18th-ranked Louisville 69-49 at the Carrier Dome.
He met his wife, his daughter and some friends for a dinner out after the game and was driving alone from the restaurant, Fitzpatrick said. The scene of the accident is between the dome and Boeheim's suburban home.
""It's just a terrible, unfortunate accident,"" Fitzpatrick told ESPN. ""We don't yet know [exactly] what caused the initial accident. Coach Boeheim was not involved in that accident. The occupants of the vehicle, including the deceased, were wandering in the road.""
It is not clear if Boeheim will coach the Orange against No. 1 Duke on Saturday night. ESPN's College GameDay was supposed to originate from the Carrier Dome, but a decision was made Thursday afternoon to have GameDay air from Bristol.
""We appreciate their concern for our community during this difficult time,"" Syracuse athletic director John Wildhack said in a statement.
He added that the university sent its condolences to ""all impacted by this tragic accident."" Wildhack echoed police, saying Boeheim ""is in contact with local authorities and cooperating fully."" Wildhack said Boeheim met briefly with his team Thursday but did not attend or participate in practice.
Boeheim has coached at Syracuse, his alma mater, since 1976 and is one of the most accomplished coaches in the country. He ranks second all time in wins in Division I with 944, behind only Duke's Mike Krzyzewski. During his 43 years at Syracuse, Boeheim has led the team to a national title in 2003 and five Final Four appearances.

26141993,"A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced the three men convicted of pay-for-play schemes to steer high-profile recruits to Adidas-sponsored college basketball programs to multiple months in prison.
U.S. District Court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan sentenced former Adidas executive James Gatto to nine months in federal prison, former Adidas consultant Merl Code to six months and aspiring sports business manager Christian Dawkins to six months.
In October, a federal jury in New York convicted the three men of felony charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud after a three-week criminal trial. They were accused of funneling money from Adidas to the families of high-profile recruits to ensure they signed with the sneaker company and certain financial planners and business managers once the players turned pro.
Steven Haney, Dawkins' attorney, said all three men were released on appeal bonds Tuesday and all three plan to appeal their convictions.
The defendants' attorneys had argued for noncustodial sentences.
""It is in many respects unprecedented in its sophistication, in its coordination, and with respect to Mr. Gatto in particular, in its repetitive nature over a period of time,"" Assistant U.S Attorney Edward Diskant said Tuesday.
Kaplan said he sympathized with the argument that the defendants were being punished when others who did similar things were not being prosecuted. Nonetheless, he said, ""These defendants all knew what they were doing was wrong.''
The judge added that he wanted to send ""a great big warning light to the basketball world.''
""I deeply regret my actions,'' Gatto said in a shaky voice.
Dawkins referenced ""social dysfunction'' in college basketball and said his actions were ""clouded'' by a ""system that takes advantage of kids.''
""I realize now more than ever none of this was worth it,'' Dawkins said.
Code said he also regretted his actions but added, ""Some things really got to be changed about college basketball.''
Among other allegations, the men were accused of conspiring to pay $100,000 from Adidas to Brian ""Tugs"" Bowen's father to influence Bowen to sign with Louisville in the summer of 2017.
Gatto, the sneaker company's former director of global sports marketing for basketball, also was accused of conspiring with former Adidas consultant T.J. Gassnola to pay $90,000 to former Kansas prospect Billy Preston's mother and $20,000 to current Jayhawks player Silvio De Sousa's guardian.
Gassnola testified during the trial that he also gave former NC State assistant Orlando Early $40,000 to secure the commitment of former Wolfpack star Dennis Smith Jr. after Gatto approved the payment.
The government was attempting to recoup more than $1.1 million for Kansas, more than $250,000 for NC State and nearly $32,000 for Louisville to reimburse the schools for scholarships and legal fees related to the scandal.
The defendants' attorneys argued throughout the trial that their clients intended to help the universities by assisting them in signing talented basketball recruits and never intended to harm the schools, as federal prosecutors alleged.
During closing arguments, Michael Schachter, one of Gatto's attorneys, told the jury that his client approved the payments to players' families at the request of coaches, including Kansas' Bill Self.
Schachter also said former Louisville coach Rick Pitino was aware of payments to Bowen's father.
Code and Dawkins are scheduled for a second trial at U.S. District Court in Manhattan on April 22 in a separate case involving alleged college basketball corruption.
Code and Dawkins are accused of bribing three former assistant coaches -- Arizona's Emanuel ""Book"" Richardson, USC's Tony Bland and Oklahoma State's Lamont Evans -- to steer their players to Dawkins' fledgling sports agency and financial planners once they turned pro.
The three assistant coaches have reached plea agreements with federal prosecutors. It is unclear whether they will testify for the federal government.
Haney notified Arizona's Sean Miller and LSU's Will Wade last month that he intends to subpoena them to testify in the April trial.
""The sentencing has nothing to do with April,"" Haney said. ""We have a case to defend and feel strongly about our position. We're 1,000 percent not backing down.""
Haney said he plans to call as many coaches as needed in April's trial. ""Whatever it takes, this will be a different fight,"" Haney said.
Former Auburn assistant Chuck Person and former NBA referee Rashan Michel are scheduled for trial in June. Person is accused of accepting $91,500 in bribes from a federal cooperating witness to influence Auburn players to sign with financial advisers and agents.

26250429,"Suspended LSU coach Will Wade's attorney has notified university officials that his client won't sit down to discuss his relationship with convicted middle man Christian Dawkins until after the federal government concludes its investigation into college basketball corruption.
In a letter sent to LSU chancellor F. King Alexander, athletic director Joe Alleva and others, Wade's attorney, Michael G. McGovern in New York, wrote that ""upon conclusion of the pending [Southern District of New York] criminal investigation, Coach Wade will be happy to meet with you and LSU's Board of Supervisors and to answer any and all questions you may have.""
Wade's unwillingness to discuss what he said to Dawkins in telephone calls that were intercepted by FBI wiretaps likely means he won't coach in this week's SEC tournament or any of the No. 9 Tigers' games in the upcoming NCAA tournament.
The Baton Rouge Advocate first reported details of Wade's attorney's letter on Wednesday.
LSU officials suspended Wade and named Tony Benford interim coach on Friday after Wade refused to discuss published reports about his involvement in alleged pay-for-play deals.
Thomas Skinner, LSU's vice president for legal affairs and general counsel, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last week, ESPN and Yahoo! Sports reported that in one of the phone calls intercepted by FBI wiretaps, Wade expressed frustration about his inability to close what he described as a ""strong-ass offer"" for a recruit.
According to people familiar with the calls, Wade was frustrated with a handler of current LSU guard Javonte Smart, who was then a top-50 recruit from Baton Rouge.
Smart didn't play in LSU's 80-59 victory over Vanderbilt on Saturday night, which clinched the SEC regular-season title for the Tigers. His status for the postseason remains unclear.
""I was thinking last night on this Smart thing,"" Wade told Dawkins during one of the calls. ""I'll be honest with you, I'm [expletive] tired of dealing with the thing. Like I'm just [expletive] sick of dealing with the s---. Like, this should not be that [expletive] complicated.""
""Dude,"" Wade continued during the call, ""I went to [the handler] with a [expletive] strong-ass offer about a month ago. [Expletive] strong.
""The problem was, I know why he didn't take it now. It was [expletive] tilted toward the family a little bit. It was tilted toward taking care of the mom, taking care of the kid. Like it was tilted towards that. Now I know for a fact he didn't explain everything to the mom. I know now, he didn't get enough of the piece of the pie in the deal.
""It was a [expletive] hell of a [expletive] offer. Hell of an offer. ... Especially for a kid who is going to be a two- or three-year kid.""
In a different telephone call with Dawkins, Wade joked that the player would be compensated more than the ""rookie minimum.""
Wade told Dawkins that he had made deals for ""as good of players as him"" that were ""a lot simpler than this.""
Steven Haney, Dawkins' attorney, told ESPN that he plans to subpoena Wade, Arizona's Sean Miller and possibly other coaches to testify in an April 22 federal criminal trial in New York. Dawkins and former Adidas consultant Merl Code are accused of bribing assistant coaches to influence their players to sign with Dawkins' fledgling sports agency once they turned pro.

26193480,"Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said star freshman Zion Williamson had his ""first really good workout"" Thursday as he continues his recovery from a sprained right knee, although he remains doubtful to play in Saturday's regular-season finale against No. 3 North Carolina.
ESPN.com's college hoops experts make their picks for Duke-UNC and other top games.
Either Duke or UNC will lose on Saturday, but the metrics tell us both teams still deserve a No. 1 seed come Selection Sunday.
Looking to watch No. 4 Duke visit No. 3 UNC on ESPN on Saturday? Here's how to do it.
Krzyzewski said Friday that Williamson would have another workout without contact later in the day barring any setbacks after his activity Thursday. And while it sounds like Williamson is on his way to missing a fifth straight game, the Hall of Fame coach expressed optimism that he could be ready for next week's ACC tournament in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""The way it's going, he's not going to be doubtful for the tournament,"" Krzyzewski said. Thursday's workout ""was pretty exciting, really, to see him move and have confidence in his movements. Now we've got to get him into condition and have him do some work"" against contact.
Williamson was hurt in the opening minute of last month's loss to the Tar Heels, complete with the far-reaching bizarre image of his left foot tearing through his shoe as he fell to the court. He has missed four games since.
Williamson is averaging 21.6 points and 8.8 rebounds along with being a walking highlight reel of jaw-dropping athleticism and high-flying dunks. He's made himself a candidate to be national player of the year and the No. 1 overall NBA draft pick, joining freshman teammate and ACC scoring leader RJ Barrett (23.3 points) to give the Blue Devils an unstoppable one-two punch.
Duke (26-4, 14-3 ACC) is 3-2 in the nearly five full games without Williamson.
""He's so team-oriented,'' Krzyzewski said. ""I think it bothers him that he hasn't been with us. But we can't let him push the process too much to where his loyalty to his team -- and he hasn't -- goes against him coming back the way he should come back.''

UNC coach Roy Williams said Thursday the Tar Heels (25-5, 15-2) wouldn't focus on whether Williamson would be ready.
""We're still preparing like Zion's going to play,'' Williams said. ""And at the same time, they're going to make that decision so we have no say over it -- so why worry about that part of it?''
Krzyzewski said the fourth-ranked Blue Devils will announce Williamson's status for the ACC matchup after Saturday morning's shootaround.
""We'll put it out,'' Krzyzewski said. ""I've never liked playing that game or when someone plays that game with me. It's disrespectful. ... I don't think they are worried about if Zion plays or not. They are worried about their own performance.''

26261002,"A source confirmed to ESPN on Wednesday night that Bruins freshman David Singleton and redshirt junior Prince Ali will miss the rest of the season because of foot injuries.
Singleton broke his foot Wednesday night in the Bruins' 79-72 win over Stanford in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament. Ali's season is over because of plantar fasciitis, which caused him to miss UCLA's past six games.
The Los Angeles Times was first to report Singleton's injury, which he later confirmed in a tweet:
I've gave it my all this season. I can't wait until year 2 at UCLA. I wish all my brothers luck in the tournament. Sniper out. ✌🏾 https://t.co/m7pou1Bmbl
Singleton, who played a season-high 33 minutes on Wednesday, scored eight points and had six rebounds against the Cardinal. Singleton was averaging 5.1 points and 1.1 rebounds per game and entered the Pac-12 tournament as the Pac-12's leader in 3-point field goal percentage at 47.2 percent (34 of 72 attempts).
Ali averaged 9.6 points and 2.7 rebounds in the 26 games he played in this season.
Singleton replaced Ali in the starting lineup in five of the past six games, including Wednesday.
The seventh-seeded Bruins (17-15, 9-9 Pac-12) meet 2-seed Arizona State (21-9, 12-6) in the second round of the Pac-12 tournament Thursday night. UCLA's chances of making the NCAA tournament probably rest on earning an automatic bid by winning the Pac-12 tournament, something the Bruins haven't done since 2014.

26275996,"Moos issued a statement shortly after the Cornhuskers lost 66-62 to No. 19 Wisconsin in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals. Despite only six healthy scholarship players, Nebraska beat Rutgers and No. 21 Maryland in the first two rounds of the tournament, after beating Iowa in overtime Sunday in its regular-season finale. The Huskers are 18-16 and went 6-14 in the Big Ten.
""We will await Sunday's announcement to see if we receive an invitation to participate in the NIT,"" Moos said in a prepared statement. ""Once our season is completed, my evaluation of our men's basketball program will draw to a close.""
Nate Reuvers scored 14 points, D'Mitrik Trice hit a clutch 3-pointer with 58 seconds left and No. 19 Wisconsin beat pesky Nebraska 66-62 on Friday to advance to the Big Ten tournament semifinals.
Moos didn't attend Nebraska's past two Big Ten tournament games but has been in communication with Miles, who is 115-113 in seven seasons at the school. He has led the Huskers to one NCAA tournament appearance and an NIT appearance last season despite a 13-5 record in the Big Ten.
""I love coaching, I love being at Nebraska, I love this group of guys,"" Miles said. ""As you move forward, in this business, I want to keep going and whatever happens just happens. I really don't think I'd make a very good insurance salesman or financial guy. ... It's coaching.""
Last April, Miles received a one-year contract extension through the 2020-21 season. Moos, who came to Nebraska in 2017, did not hire Miles, who is 399-332 in 24 years as a college coach.
""He's a good coach,"" senior guard James Palmer said. ""He recruited me hard coming here. He's a good dude off the court, and he takes care of us, so I think he should definitely stay.""

26077481,"Zion Williamson is ""getting better,"" but he won't be on the court for No. 3 Duke's game at Virginia Tech on Tuesday, coach Mike Krzyzewski said.
It will be Williamson's second missed game since suffering a Grade 1 sprain of his right knee early in a loss against North Carolina last week. Krzyzewski said Williamson, the projected No. 1 overall NBA draft pick, is making progress on a four-step recovery schedule that the school uses for knee injuries, but they're being cautious not to put a timetable on his return.
""He's going through that, and when he gets through all of them, we'll see where he's at,"" Krzyzewski said. ""There's no timetable. We don't want to put the pressure of time on him.""
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said he has not had any conversations with Zion Williamson or his family about shutting down the injured freshman star.
Gonzaga, which was the No.1 team for two weeks earlier this season, has reclaimed the top spot in this week's AP Top 25 men's college basketball poll.
There should be no asterisk on North Carolina's victory in Durham. The Tar Heels are the real deal.
Krzyzewski acknowledged that Williamson's injury has forced the spotlight onto the NBA's current ""one-and-done"" rule that forces players to spend at least a year out of high school before entering the draft. And while he's chagrined that it's his player who's the focus of the discussion, Krzyzewski said he feels the debate is warranted.
""Zion is a player that attracts attention,"" Krzyzewski said. ""It's interesting how every issue in college basketball -- amateurism, paying, going early -- are all brought in at this point. I do think in some ways it's good. They have a face to talk about, not just the injury.
""All those things should be talked about; it's just they're talking about him. And I think they should be discussed and remedied, but the main thing we're talking about is getting him healthy.""
For his part, Williamson has suggested all season that playing one year at Duke was a priority for him.
""Even if I could've went straight from high school [to the NBA], I would've come to college,"" Williamson said before he suffered the injury. ""I feel like college is something I couldn't miss out on.""
The debate was underscored last week, however, as reports suggested the NBA had formally proposed lowering the age limit to 18, allowing players to go to the league directly from high school.
North Carolina coach Roy Williams said he'd be fine with that change, but he sees value in the current model, too.
""For the majority of people, it's probably been good for them,"" Williams said. ""There's no perfect rule for everybody, but there are probably more kids that made mistakes straight out of high school.""
Williams' teams at UNC have featured relatively few one-and-dones, compared with Duke and Kentucky, which have thrived under the system by luring NBA-ready talent to campus for a single season.
""I've tried to recruit a heck of a lot of kids that ended up being one-and-done, I just didn't get many of them,"" Williams said. ""We had Tony Bradley, Marvin Williams, Brandon Wright, and I'd take all of them again for one day, one week, one month, one year. They were great for our program.""
Williamson has clearly been a boon for Duke, and Krzyzewski said the focus remains on getting him back on the court.
""The main thing is for him to get healthy and continue to improve,"" Krzyzewski said. ""We've got some new things we saw against Syracuse [in a victory Saturday] and maybe there'll be more [vs. Virginia Tech].""

Nevada forward Jordan Caroline punched a glass fire extinguisher case outside the locker rooms after Utah State upset the No. 12 Wolf Pack on Saturday night in Logan, Utah.
Utah State defeated Nevada 81-76 to take over first place in the Mountain West Conference by a half-game. Fans rushed onto the court immediately following the final whistle while Nevada players were ushered toward a hallway leading to the locker rooms.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
Video posted online by KUTV2 in Salt Lake City showed an agitated Caroline yelling and punching the glass of a fire extinguisher case, cutting his knuckle. He then had to be held back from returning back up the hallway.
Several members of the Nevada coaching staff could be heard on video, with at least one assistant yelling at police officers. Nevada alleged that fans touched Wolf Pack players as they left the court and that a Utah State assistant coach used profane language toward the team after the game. Head coach Eric Musselman was not made available to comment after the game.
Nevada did not make players or coaches available to the media after the game.
""We are working with officials from the Mountain West Conference and Utah State to gather more information about the events that occurred this evening in Logan,"" a Nevada spokesperson said.
Utah State athletic director John Hartwell also said he would work with the conference to determine the causes of the incident and potential repercussions.

Williamson injured his left knee against North Carolina on Feb. 20, and the Blue Devils have struggled in his absence, dropping three of six games.
Amid debate that the ACC Player of the Year and likely first overall selection in June's NBA draft should sit out the rest of the season, coach Mike Krzyzewski had offered assurances Williamson would return and had pointed to Thursday's game as the most likely date to get back on the court.
Williamson practiced in full throughout the week, and Krzyzewski said he expected the team would have a quick adjustment period working its star forward back into the lineup, putting the Blue Devils squarely back in the national championship picture.
""We have a re-set button,"" Krzyzewski said after a loss to UNC to cap the regular season. ""If Zion's healthy, we have a chance.""

Jim Boeheim will resume his coaching duties for Syracuse on Friday and coach the Orange in Saturday's game against top-ranked Duke.
He remains day-to-day.
Less than one minute into Wednesday's game, Williamson slipped as he planted hard near the free throw line and broke through his left shoe, falling awkwardly. Williamson limped off the court and into the locker room, and he didn't return.
Williamson is averaging 21.6 points, 8.8 rebounds and 2.2 steals per game for the No. 1 Blue Devils (23-3).
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said Thursday that he was ""optimistic"" about Williamson's status.
""The preliminary reports that we have on Zion's injury are all optimistic -- very, very good,"" Krzyzewski said on his weekly show on ESPNU Radio on SiriusXM. ""And the fact that it's a stable condition, a mild sprain, and we're going to do what everyone would do, and that's what's in the best interest of the young man. And Zion will get proper care.
""... There's no rush. You want to make sure he's completely at 100 percent.""
Duke lost the first meeting against Syracuse at home, although Cam Reddish didn't play and Tre Jones played only six minutes.
Without Williamson against the Tar Heels, the Blue Devils averaged a season-low 0.84 points per possession and were outscored by 34 points in the paint -- Duke's worst differential in eight seasons.

26269285,"UCLA was eliminated from the Pac-12 tournament Thursday night after an 83-72 loss to Arizona State in the quarterfinals, and at 17-16, the Bruins will miss the NCAA tournament for the first time since the 2015 season.
With Steve Alford being fired after a 7-6 start, athletic director Dan Guerrero must find someone to turn around a once-storied basketball program after a decade of inconsistent and sometimes underwhelming basketball in Westwood.
Guerrero isn't tipping his hand one way or the other on the direction or stages of the hiring process, only saying this week that it's going well. He also has no timetable for hiring a coach.
""We're doing our research,"" Guerrero told ESPN earlier this week. ""It could be tomorrow or it could be a month from now.""
One name he can scratch off of his potential list of candidates is interim head coach Murry Bartow, who took over for Alford in January and coached the Bruins to a 10-10 record during the second half of the season. Bartow said after Thursday's loss that he doesn't want to be UCLA's permanent head coach and expects the Bruins to find the right coach for the job without him.
""They'll hire a very good coach, I'm sure, and hopefully there's good days ahead for me,"" Bartow said. ""I'm sure there are.""
Bartow, who was hired as a UCLA assistant last April and whose father, Gene, replaced legendary UCLA coach John Wooden in 1975, was visibly emotional during his final news conference as UCLA's coach. He got choked up talking about his last message to his team in the locker room following Thursday's loss.
""That's tough,"" he said. ""I mean, it's tough to share all that with you. A lot of that is just kind of between me and the team. But really just the fact that I'm very proud of them and what they accomplished. It's been a hard year for them. We don't have to go through all that, but it's been a tough year for them and our team. But I can just say this: When [associate head coach] Duane [Broussard] and [assistant coach] Tyus Edney and I took over in early January, they have just -- they've never taken a day off. They just have never taken a day off. So I think the message in the locker room from Tyus and Duane and I was just, you know, how much we love them, how much we care for them. And that's about it.""
Sophomore guards Jaylen Hands and Kris Wilkes, who combined to score 46 points and hit 10 of 20 3-point shots against the Sun Devils, praised the job their coaches did during a tumultuous season, especially Bartow.
""I think coach Bartow is a really good man, and I appreciate all them coming and fighting with us day by day, too,"" Hands said.
Added Wilkes: ""Most definitely. It could have been easy for any of them to leave. Broussard has been with coach Steve [Alford] a long time, Tyus and all them, [athletic performance coach] Wes [Long]. But they all stuck with us, and just thankful for that.""
Freshman center Moses Brown, who had two points and seven rebounds Thursday, said Bartow was ""probably one of my favorite coaches I've had.""
""It was an amazing job,"" Brown said of Bartow's coaching job this season. ""After our head coach had been fired, usually a team would be disoriented, but he did an amazing job of keeping us together as a team. This has been an amazing experience.""
As for the futures of Hands, Wilkes and Brown, who were the Bruins' top scorers this season, they all said they were undecided about whether they would come back to UCLA for another season or declare for the NBA draft.
""I'm not worried about anything about the future right now,"" said Wilkes, who averaged a team-high 17.4 points this season and is currently ranked as the No. 68 draft prospect by ESPN. ""I'm just trying to stay with my team, stay with them now, and whatever happens, happens.""

26137053,"The Mountain West Conference concluded Monday that the fracas following Saturday's Utah State vs. Nevada game came as a result of ""inappropriate conduct"" in the handshake line and in the locker room areas, not the postgame court rush.
Nevada forward Jordan Caroline punched a glass fire extinguisher case outside the locker rooms after Utah State upset the No. 12 Wolf Pack 81-76, and several Nevada staff members were seen on video yelling at security and police officers.
""After a thorough investigation into the circumstances of Saturday night's incident, which included a review of numerous video clips from various sources and the collection of written statements from multiple individuals, the Mountain West has concluded the situation was not caused by the court rush,"" the league's statement read. ""There was a postgame management plan in place and it was executed successfully.
""Rather, inappropriate conduct by individuals from both programs in the postgame handshake line and subsequently in the locker room areas created the unfortunate circumstances. The Conference has had multiple communications with both athletics directors and has shared the findings of its review. Each institution will be responsible for the determination and administration of what it deems appropriate disciplinary action for those involved. It must be made clear unsportsmanlike and unprofessional conduct is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.""
Utah State athletic director John Hartwell called his staff members' behavior ""unacceptable"" but said any discipline would be handled internally.
""First of all, we want to thank both the Mountain West and the University of Nevada in helping us review the postgame incident from Saturday night,"" Hartwell said in a statement. ""While unfortunate, it should not overshadow what was a great college basketball game between two NCAA Tournament-caliber teams. After reviewing all the evidence, from surveillance video to eyewitness accounts, the incident was not a game management issue and was not caused by our students rushing the court. The unsportsmanlike behavior following the game did not include any of our student-athletes, but rather a couple of staff members, which is unacceptable, and we will handle those issues internally. Moving forward, Utah State Athletics will review our game management procedures in an effort to continually learn and improve.""
Nevada head coach Eric Musselman sent out a pair of tweets regarding Caroline, who practiced on Monday and is questionable for Tuesday's game at Air Force, sources told ESPN.
""As someone who's had the honor to know and coach Jordan Caroline for four years, I can testify to his outstanding character, high moral standards and strong integrity.

The 6-foot-11 forward entered Thursday averaging 10.3 points and 5.1 rebounds.

26192669,"LSU has suspended men's basketball coach Will Wade indefinitely, the school announced Friday.
The decision comes a day after reports that FBI wiretaps intercepted telephone calls between Wade and aspiring business manager Christian Dawkins, in which Wade expressed frustration about his inability to close what he described as a ""strong-ass offer"" for a recruit.
""Recent media reports regarding Coach Will Wade are without question concerning to us all,"" read a statement from LSU president/chancellor F. King Alexander and athletic director Joe Alleva. ""As such, we and university officials have taken deliberate and purposeful steps to fairly assess and adequately address the situation. As we have done since media reports first surfaced months ago, we are closely coordinating with the NCAA with every step. They have our full cooperation and we will continue to report to them all facts and information on this matter.
FBI wiretaps intercepted telephone calls between LSU coach Will Wade and aspiring business manager Christian Dawkins, in which Wade expressed frustration about his inability to close an offer for a recruit, sources told ESPN.
""All of us at LSU share the obligation to protect the integrity of this institution, as such we have suspended Head Coach Will Wade indefinitely until such time as we can ensure full compliance with the NCAA, as well as institutional policies and standards. Assistant coach Tony Benford will assume the duties of interim coach.""
Wade expressed his commitment to LSU's players and coaches in a statement and said more facts are yet to come out.
""I cannot comment at this time on various media reports, except to say that they do not begin to tell the full story,"" Wade said in the statement. ""I understand the University had to take action before all the facts are in, but I would ask everyone to withhold their judgment until the record is complete.""
SEC commissioner Greg Sankey said in a statement that he supports LSU's suspension of Wade.
""The information in recent news reports is very disturbing, if true,"" read the statement. ""Considering the existing circumstances, LSU has taken appropriate action today while the investigation continues. The SEC serves in an advisory role with our institutions in NCAA compliance issues and the Conference Office will continue to assist LSU as it moves forward in this matter.""
No. 10 LSU is 25-5 and tied for first in the SEC with a 15-2 record. The Tigers host Vanderbilt on Saturday in their regular-season finale.
Yahoo Sports first reported details about the contents of one of the telephone calls on Thursday.
ESPN has independently verified the calls between Dawkins and Wade, which occurred in 2017, when the FBI was monitoring one of Dawkins' cellphones as part of the federal government's clandestine investigation into college basketball corruption.
According to people familiar with the calls, Wade was frustrated with a handler of current LSU guard Javonte Smart, who was then a top-50 recruit from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. LSU is expected to make an announcement regarding the status of Smart ahead of the team's 8:30 p.m. tip-off against Vanderbilt on Saturday.
""I was thinking last night on this Smart thing,"" Wade told Dawkins during one of the calls. ""I'll be honest with you, I'm [expletive] tired of dealing with the thing. Like I'm just [expletive] sick of dealing with the [expletive]. Like, this should not be that [expletive] complicated.
""Dude,"" Wade continued during the call, ""I went to [the handler] with a [expletive] strong-ass offer about a month ago. [Expletive] strong.
""The problem was, I know why he didn't take it now, it was [expletive] tilted toward the family a little bit. It was tilted toward taking care of the mom, taking care of the kid. Like it was tilted towards that. Now I know for a fact he didn't explain everything to the mom. I know now, he didn't get enough of the piece of the pie in the deal.""
""It was a [expletive] hell of a [expletive] offer,"" Wade continued. ""Hell of an offer. ... Especially for a kid who is going to be a two- or three-year kid.""
In a different telephone call with Dawkins, Wade joked that the player would be compensated more than the ""rookie minimum.""
Wade told Dawkins that he had made deals for ""as good of players as him"" that were ""a lot simpler than this.""

26265947,"Oats is also now the highest-paid coach in the Mid-American Conference. He will make $837,000 annually, the school announced.
""This new contract for Nate is extremely well deserved,"" athletic director Mark Alnutt said in a news release. ""I have been extremely impressed on how he has built this program to one that deserves national attention and respect. I would like to thank [President] Dr. [Satish] Tripathi for his leadership and tremendous support for our student-athletes and our athletic program as a whole. Furthermore, this could not have been done without the support of our dedicated [fan] base. I look forward to working with Nate and his staff for the remainder of this season and for many years to come.""
Oats was expected to be one of the hotter names on the college basketball coaching carousel this spring. He took over at Buffalo in 2015 after two seasons as an assistant coach under Bobby Hurley, and will lead the Bulls to their third NCAA tournament appearance under his watch next week.
They won the MAC last season and then beat Arizona in the first round of the NCAA tournament, and have followed that up with a top-25 ranking this season and another MAC regular-season title.
""Our family and our coaching staff are extremely thankful for the appreciation shown for the job we have done by President Tripathi, Mark Alnutt, and the entire administration at UB,"" Oats said in the news release. ""The support from our community, fans, and boosters has been nothing short of incredible. We love it in Buffalo and look forward to continuing to build on what we have going here.""
After Thursday's MAC tournament win over Akron, Oats is 93-42 at Buffalo, sitting at 29-3 (16-2 in the MAC) entering the conference tournament semifinals.

26272376,"LSU guard Javonte Smart returned to the Tigers' SEC tournament opener against Florida on Friday, scoring 13 points off the bench in a 76-73 loss.
Smart, averaging 11.5 points and 3.3 rebounds for the Tigers, was held out of LSU's regular-season finale against Vanderbilt after his recruitment reportedly was linked to FBI wiretaps that included LSU coach Will Wade.
The school said in a release that Smart had fully cooperated in a joint investigation between LSU and the NCAA.
Wade remains off the LSU sideline, as he has declined to meet with the school and NCAA until the federal government inquiry is complete.

26275805,"In a letter Friday to U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Robert Boone and Aline Flodr wrote, ""It is the government's understanding that the defendant Chuck Connors Person wishes to enter a change of plea in the above-captioned case.""
The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in New York.
Person had previously pleaded not guilty to six felony charges related to bribery, solicitation of bribes, wire fraud and travel act conspiracy.
According to sources, Person is expected to plead guilty to one conspiracy charge and will receive a sentence similar to the ones offered to former assistant coaches -- with a recommended sentence of about 24 to 30 months in prison -- in a separate criminal case involving college basketball corruption.
Person's co-defendant, former NBA referee and Atlanta bespoke clothier Rashan Michel, is still scheduled to go to trial in New York in June.
A former Auburn and NBA player and an assistant coach at his alma mater from 2014 to 2017, Person is accused of soliciting and accepting at least $91,500 from Louis Martin Blazer III, a former financial adviser, who was working as a cooperating witness for the FBI in its investigation into college basketball corruption.
Person is also accused of helping facilitate money to players' families. The government alleges he provided $11,000 to one player's family and $7,500 to another's.
Michel is accused of brokering the relationship between Blazer and Person, as well as receiving tens of thousands of dollars from Blazer to introduce him to Person and other college coaches.
Auburn players Austin Wiley and Danjel Purifoy were ruled ineligible for the 2017-18 season after the university self-reported violations involving recruiting, extra benefits and agents. Purifoy was also suspended for 30 percent of the 2018-19 season and didn't play in the Tigers' first nine games this season.

26242647,"This is the best time of the year for a basketball lover. The end of the college season is upon us, with conference tournaments, the NCAA tournament and the Final Four in the brutally cold Midwest city of Minneapolis. The Final Four is followed by the end of the NBA season, the NBA playoffs and, then, the NBA draft. Only after the NBA draft is complete can we finally turn our limited attention spans to football to watch five teams jockey for position for a national championship until basketball starts again in October.
Here's your updated source for all of the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
Of course, basketball is the fairest, most equitable championship known to sports. The NCAA tournament is not the best way to find the best team, but there is no championship in sports that is as fair to all comers. With more than 350 Division I teams, all have the same opportunity to make the field to legitimately compete for the national championship. Football gives only a fraction of teams that chance to compete for the title. In basketball, all have the same chance.
How is that so? The automatic bid. Every team in Division I has the opportunity to win its league's automatic bid and do so among its peers that it chose to compete with. For the populist crowd that believes the NCAA tournament isn't fair to the little guy, every league gets to decide for itself how to give out its automatic bid. A league can give it to the regular-season champion, the tournament champion, through arm wrestling or through a raffle. The truth is, leagues don't really care about having their best teams go to the NCAA tournament. They would rather sell their tournaments to television for ... wait for it ... the money.

After the 32 automatic bids are determined, the 36 next-best teams are selected. Each team gets two bites at the NCAA tournament apple. Yet every year there is the populist, bleeding heart sentiment that goes with the tournament -- let the ""little guy"" in so we can watch more Davids take a swing at the Goliaths. This year, the cries will be even more intense because the bubble isn't just soft -- it is absolutely mush. The selection committee might have no choice but to select average teams to fill out the 36 at-large spots and to do so with teams that have lost 15 or 16 games. In other words, it might have to pick teams that are just not very good.
Here are the 19 ""one-bid"" leagues, no matter which team wins the automatic bid: America East, Atlantic Sun, Big Sky, Big South, Big West, Colonial, Horizon, Ivy, MAC, MAAC, MEAC, Missouri Valley, NEC, Patriot, Southland, SWAC, Summit, Sun Belt and WAC. As each automatic bid is claimed, you can knock out one team from the bottom of the top 68.
Here are the 13 leagues that might send more than one team to the NCAA field: American, Atlantic 10, ACC, Big 12, Big East, Big Ten, C-USA, Mountain West, Ohio Valley, Pac-12, SoCon, SEC and WCC.
One thing is for certain: There will be bad teams in the field this season. Selection is not that important, given just how bad the bubble is. Seeding is everything this season.
1. Virginia Cavaliers
If you saw Virginia's 18-for-25 shooting performance from 3-point territory against Syracuse, you saw a team shoot better than the equivalent of 100 percent from 2-point range. Virginia is a fabulous offensive team that can shoot it from multiple spots (Kyle Guy, Ty Jerome and De'Andre Hunter). This looks like the No. 1 overall seed in the tournament.
2. Gonzaga Bulldogs
Killian Tillie is back and playing, and that is nothing but a good thing. In spite of its uncharacteristic performance in the WCC final, Gonzaga is the best offensive team in the nation. The Zags were good enough to win it all without the big, sweet-shooting Frenchman Tillie. With him, the Zags are significantly better. No matter what, this is a No. 1 seed.
3. North Carolina Tar Heels
The Tar Heels have matured into an outstanding team capable of cutting the nets down in Minneapolis. With Coby White playing at a high level and the Heels playing hard, North Carolina has won 14 of 15, including a sweep of Zion Williamson-less Duke, since getting worked by Louisville at home.
4. Duke Blue Devils
Zion is supposed to be back for the ACC tournament. If he is the old Zion, Duke can win it all. If not, Duke can be beaten by anybody in the top 20.
5. Kentucky Wildcats
The Wildcats need Reid Travis back healthy to have the physicality they need to reach the Final Four. Kentucky has improved defensively and is one of just four teams in the top 15 in the nation in both offensive and defensive efficiency.
6. Tennessee Volunteers
The Vols lost three of their last seven games in SEC play, but this is still a formidable team. Jordan Bone is the best point guard in the SEC and was magnificent against Kentucky in Knoxville.
7. Michigan State Spartans
The Spartans won their ninth Big Ten title under Tom Izzo and did so while banged up and injured. With Nick Ward back for the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments, Michigan State has the chops to play ball for three weeks in the NCAA tournament. If Michigan State can win the Big Ten tournament, the Spartans have an outside chance at a No. 1 seed.
8. Houston Cougars
The Cougars are legit. Wins over LSU, UCF and Cincinnati twice are good wins but not quite No. 1 seed territory. However, Houston is Final Four-capable.
9. Michigan Wolverines
The Wolverines are not deep but can really defend. With better rebounding, Michigan is Elite Eight good.
10. Texas Tech Red Raiders
The Red Raiders have improved on the offensive end more than any other team among the top 20 in the past month. Texas Tech has topped 80 points in six of its past nine games, in part due to the great play of Jarrett Culver and in part due to the improved play of Davide Moretti and Matt Mooney. Texas Tech hasn't lost in more than a month.
11. Purdue Boilermakers
By the end of the Big Ten tournament, Purdue will likely have two players who have hit more than 100 3s: Carsen Edwards and Ryan Cline. The Boilermakers take care of the ball, rebound it well and take good shots. That's a good formula for winning games and sharing a Big Ten title.
12. LSU Tigers
Who knows what will happen with this team, given the uncertainty that goes with the suspension of Will Wade. The SEC Champs* are very talented and very good. Tremont Waters is among the best guards in the country, and he plays at both ends of the floor.
13. Virginia Tech Hokies
Buzz Williams has done a remarkable job with Justin Robinson out and perhaps not coming back this season. Kerry Blackshear Jr. is one of the best big men in the country, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker is one of the best offensive players in the nation. With Robinson, the Final Four was a legit goal. Without him, the second weekend would be a great success.
14. Nevada Wolf Pack
The Mountain West did not offer Nevada much resistance outside of Utah State. Jordan Caroline has had a fabulous season, and Caleb Martin and Jazz Johnson have been the outside attack for the Wolf Pack. No team is older and more experienced, which could make the difference in NCAA tournament play.
15. Auburn Tigers
Bruce Pearl's team has been up and down, but if Jared Harper, Bryce Brown and Chuma Okeke shoot the ball well, Auburn is a tough team to beat. The big question is whether Auburn can turn people over in the tournament. Auburn is No. 1 in the nation in forcing turnovers, with a 25 percent turnover percentage.
16. Villanova Wildcats
Jay Wright has done a remarkable job ... again. The Villanova culture won the Big East title this year more than anything else. Only two Big East teams finished above .500 in conference play: Villanova and Marquette. Amazing.
17. Marquette Golden Eagles
The Golden Eagles were in the driver's seat with four games remaining but lost all four heading into the Big East tournament. But now that the regular-season hay is in the barn, it is all about getting refreshed and getting Markus Howard, Sam Hauser and Joey Hauser with fresh minds and fresh legs. Marquette can still win in March. This is a good team.
18. Kansas State Wildcats 
If Dean Wade is healthy, the Wildcats can play with anyone. But Wade is doubtful for the Big 12 tournament because of an ailing foot, and it's worth wondering whether he's going to be right for the tournament. K-State is talented, but Wade's status means there's a high degree of volatility here.
19. Florida State Seminoles
It's hard to quietly play a stretch of 12-1 basketball in the ACC, but that's the case for a Florida State team that enters the conference tournament with a head of steam. Mfiondu Kabengele (13.1 points, 5.7 rebounds per game) is a matchup problem at both ends. FSU allowed league opponents to make just 41.9 percent of 2s.
20. Louisville Cardinals
The Cards have lost seven of their past 10 games but have put together a solid résumé. Louisville has not been the same team since the second-half collapse against Duke. Still, Christen Cunningham has been among the best point guards in the league in ACC games, and Jordan Nwora was one of the very best players in the league. Louisville has the ability to be in the second weekend but needs to get over the scars of the Duke loss.
21. Kansas Jayhawks
This is not the same team that put together this stellar résumé. Kansas lost Udoka Azubuike and Lagerald Vick, and after a 15-2 start, the Jayhawks finished 8-6 down the stretch.
22. Buffalo Bulls
The Bulls are really good and can beat almost anyone. This is a team of tough competitors who know how to play and know how to win. Stumbles against Bowling Green and Northern Illinois on the road are the only blemishes on a pretty sterling résumé.
23. Maryland Terrapins
The great inside-outside combo of Bruno Fernando, a first-team all-Big Ten performer, and Anthony Cowan can compete against anyone. If Maryland takes care of the ball, the Terps can win their way into the second weekend.
24. Cincinnati Bearcats
The Bearcats are solid at the guard spots and can score a bit better than in years past. The rebounding and defense are both very good, and Cincinnati is among the best offensive rebounding teams in the country. Losses to Houston and UCF heading into the American Tournament were unpleasant but perhaps a good reminder that margins are slim.
25. Iowa State Cyclones
The Cyclones have lost six of eight heading into the Big 12 tournament. There is a major difference in performance when Iowa State changes ends. With the ball, Iowa State can score at will. On defense, Iowa State's opponents can score at will. To win in March, the latter has to change.
26. UCF Knights
The Knights finished the season strong, with wins at Houston and against Cincinnati, both ranked teams. Tacko Fall has been more aggressive and effective, and Collin Smith has added scoring punch down the stretch. UCF will be difficult for teams that have not seen Fall before to deal with.
27. VCU Rams
The Rams are interesting. VCU is really good on the defensive end, forcing turnovers, pressuring the ball, pushing up on shooters and making it hard to run offense. But VCU turns the ball over at a high clip and struggles to make perimeter shots. VCU has won a dozen straight games, just not against stellar competition.
28. Wofford Terriers
This team could make a splash in the tournament much like Davidson did in 2008. There is no Stephen Curry, but there is a Fletcher Magee, one of the best shooters in recent college basketball history. Magee is capable of hitting eight or nine 3s in a game, and if he does, Wofford will beat you. Wofford hasn't lost since before Christmas, and the only losses have been to North Carolina, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mississippi State. Pretty impressive.
29. Utah State Aggies
The Aggies have the Mountain West Player of the Year in Sam Merrill, the Defensive Player of the Year in Neemias Queta and the Coach of the Year in Craig Smith. With wins over Nevada, Fresno State and Saint Mary's, Utah State has a solid résumé. If you have studied the Aggies, you know this is a quality team that can play with almost anyone.
30. Wisconsin Badgers
The Badgers' biggest wins were over Maryland, Michigan and Iowa (twice). Wisconsin defends very well and has a star in Ethan Happ, but Happ's inability to hit free throws and perimeter shots is a problem in tournament play. The rest of his game, however, is magnificent.
31. Iowa Hawkeyes
Nobody has played more exciting basketball in February than Iowa. Every time the Hawkeyes played, Jordan Bohannon made plays to pull off an unlikely win. Then, Fran McCaffery was suspended after his ridiculous rant at an official after a 90-70 loss at Ohio State, and Iowa didn't win again. Iowa lost five of six to end the regular season.
32. Syracuse Orange
The Orange struggled to score during the regular season, but Syracuse will be a tough team to prepare for in the postseason if you are not used to seeing the Orange zone. Frank Howard and Tyus Battle need to lead the team on the offensive end. Scoring droughts are not unusual, so offense needs to be generated from defense.
33. Mississippi State Bulldogs
The Bulldogs have a nice nonconference résumé, with wins over Clemson, Saint Mary's, Dayton and Cincinnati. The SEC wins were solid, and the metrics favor Mississippi State on the offensive end of the floor. But for turnovers, the Bulldogs are among the more efficient teams in the SEC.
34. Baylor Bears
Baylor overachieved for much of the year but lost its final three games in Big 12 play and dealt with a lingering toe injury to top scorer Makai Mason (14.6 points per game). Scott Drew's Bears have to get healthy if they want to keep playing.
35. Arizona State Sun Devils
Wins over Kansas and Utah State are the Sun Devils' only wins over certain NCAA tournament teams. Arizona State gets to the foul line and does a good job on the glass. Remy Martin and Zylan Cheatham have both been solid for Bobby Hurley, and Luguentz Dort has had an excellent freshman season.
36. Clemson Tigers
The Tigers have lost some close ones. Otherwise, they would easily be on the right side of the bubble. But with a 9-9 record in the ACC, Clemson needs a win over NC State in the ACC tournament to feel in any way secure.
37. Washington Huskies
It is hard to believe, but if Washington doesn't win the Pac-12 tournament, the Huskies could be sweating out Selection Sunday. Washington is 24-7 but doesn't have a win over a team that is guaranteed to be in the NCAA field. That is strange. Washington is a tournament-caliber team, but the Pac-12 didn't do the Huskies any favors.
38. Florida Gators
The Gators are the poster children for why this bubble is so ridiculously soft. Florida is good on the defensive end but does not score easily. The Gators have some good players but have been very inconsistent. At 17-14, Florida can sneak in, but the Gators had better play well in the SEC tournament.
39. Minnesota Golden Gophers
The Gophers do not score efficiently but have some very good players, most notably Jordan Murphy, one of the best rebounders in Big Ten history. Murphy is a respected player who always delivers. A 9-11 record in Big Ten play should not be in the mix for an at-large bid, but this is not a year full of qualified teams. Average can be good enough this season.
40. Seton Hall Pirates
The Pirates are just like Indiana, but they have a better conference record and did not have the same extended swoon. Seton Hall has beaten Kentucky, Maryland, Marquette and Villanova and has only a few losses that make you raise your eyebrows. The metrics don't favor the Hall, but Myles Powell can take over and beat you.
41. NC State Wolfpack
With a healthy Markell Johnson, NC State is capable. But if not for a very soft bubble, this team would be sweating out Selection Sunday. With a loss to Clemson in the ACC tournament, it could be over for the Wolfpack.
42. Ole Miss Rebels
This team has really good guards and the SEC Coach of the Year in Kermit Davis. That said, Ole Miss is not trending in the right direction heading into the postseason, having lost four of the past six, including losses to Kentucky and Tennessee at home.
43. Temple Owls
Shizz Alston and Quinton Rose are very good guards, and Temple has wins over Houston and UCF on a résumé without a ton of losses to offset some good wins. Only losses to Tulsa and Penn stand out as less than ideal.
44. Saint Mary's Gaels
Randy Bennett has another terrific shooting team and another slate of games that make you scratch your head. The win over Gonzaga on Tuesday is the one that stands apart, but like Belmont, you know Saint Mary's can play. In fact, the Gaels' next-best wins might be their close losses to Mississippi State and LSU.
45. St. John's Red Storm
A maddening team, especially on the defensive end, St. John's has some really good wins and some equally confounding losses. Wins over Villanova, Seton Hall and Georgetown were followed by losses to those teams, but two wins over Marquette might get St. John's into the field. Jekyll and Hyde were more consistent.
46. Belmont Bruins
The Bruins can play. Dylan Windler is one of the best players in the country and will be drafted in June, right before we turn our attention back to football for a couple of months. Belmont is 26-5. The best win and the only win over a tournament team is Murray State, and then there are the two wins over Lipscomb. Belmont should be in the field, but it will require basketball judgment to justify it.
47. Indiana Hoosiers
The Hoosiers are the strangest team ever under legitimate consideration for an at-large bid. Indiana has 14 losses heading into the Big Ten tournament, including five losses to teams that will not be in the NCAA tournament field. Indiana also has good wins over Marquette, Louisville, Wisconsin and Michigan State. However, there is such a thing as too many losses. Indiana has too many losses.
48. Texas Longhorns
Similar to Indiana, Texas has had some good moments this season. The Longhorns have beaten North Carolina, Purdue, Kansas, Baylor and Iowa State but have lost to Radford, Georgia and TCU. Texas has too many losses.
49. Creighton Bluejays
Creighton has gotten itself into the NCAA tournament discussion by winning five in a row entering the Big East tournament, but Greg McDermott's team likely still has some work to do at Madison Square Garden. The Bluejays are here in large part because they're sixth in the nation in effective field goal percentage (56.9).
50. Oklahoma Sooners
Oklahoma was never above .500 in Big 12 play at any point this season, and it ended up with the No. 7 seed in the 10-team conference. But the Sooners do have a recent, decisive win over Kansas to their credit, and Christian James (14.5 points, 6.4 rebounds per game) is one of the country's good seniors.
51. Ohio State Buckeyes
OSU is 2-6 in its past eight games entering the Big Ten tourney but is about to get forward Kaleb Wesson (14.6 points, 6.7 rebounds per game) back from a team suspension and still has a chance. The Buckeyes desperately need a win over Indiana in an 8 vs. 9 game on Thursday in Chicago.
52. Oregon Ducks
The Ducks are not reaching the NCAA tournament without a run to the title in the Pac-12 tournament, but they've won four in a row -- including a win at top-seeded Washington last week -- and have the ability to make that run. Payton Pritchard (12.2 points, 4.3 assists per game) is a nice player.
53. Murray State Racers
When you have a lottery pick such as Ja Morant, you can beat somebody in the NCAA tournament. Murray State is more than Morant, but Morant is the difference-maker. Murray State played Alabama and Auburn to six- and five-point losses, respectively.
54. Butler Bulldogs
The Bulldogs are just one game over .500, but the metrics systems like them, thanks to wins over Ole Miss and Florida and the absence of a lot of truly bad losses. With Kamar Baldwin (17.5 points, 5.0 rebounds per game) leading the way, they are capable of making a run at Madison Square Garden.
55. TCU Horned Frogs 
TCU is another team that enters the conference tournament without much momentum, as Jamie Dixon's group is 2-6 in its past eight. But a decisive win at Texas in the regular-season finale gives the Horned Frogs hope. Desmond Bane (15.2 points per game) has to play well for TCU.
56. Furman Paladins
Furman is going to be an interesting case for the selection committee, as its win against Villanova back on Nov. 17 still looks very good on the résumé. The Paladins also lost to Wofford and UNC Greensboro twice each. They made 56.9 percent of their 2-point baskets this year, which was top-10 in the country.
57. New Mexico State Aggies
The Aggies have won 16 straight games since losing their WAC opener at Cal Baptist on Jan. 3, and there's every reason to expect them to keep the streak alive in the conference tournament. Senior Eli Chuha (9.9 points, 6.8 rebounds per game) is good around the rim for a team that likes to slow you down.
58. UNC Greensboro Spartans
The Spartans played well against Wofford in the Southern Conference title game, but it was not to be. The six losses on their résumé are all to quality teams (Kentucky, LSU, Furman, Wofford three times), but the lack of a truly distinctive win could hurt them.
59. Alabama Crimson Tide
The Crimson Tide will have to make some noise in the SEC tournament if they want to get back to the NCAAs, and they'll have to start by beating Ole Miss. Whatever happens, the future is bright for an Alabama team led by point guard Kira Lewis (13.9 points per game), the youngest regular in Division I basketball at 17 years, 11 months.
60. Colorado Buffaloes
The Buffaloes are another group that could make a run in a wide-open Pac-12 tournament -- they're 8-3 in their past 11 games entering the tournament and have a winnable game against Cal in round one. Tyler Bey (13.4 points, 9.6 rebounds per game) is an underrated player nationally.
61. Lipscomb Bisons
This is a good team worthy of consideration, but Lipscomb lost twice to Belmont. At the very least, Belmont has to get into the field before Lipscomb. The Bisons' selection would give a national audience a chance to witness the skills of guard Garrison Mathews (20.1 points per game), who has been a double-digit scorer in 22 straight games, including against probable tournament teams Louisville, Clemson and Vermont.
62. Northeastern Huskies 
The Huskies are in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2015 after handling CAA regular-season champion Hofstra in the conference final on Tuesday. Bill Coen's squad has a good player in senior Vasa Pusica (17.6 points per game), the Serbian guard and San Diego transfer.
63. Vermont Catamounts
The Catamounts opened the door to history when they were upset by UMBC in the America East final last year, and they'll have a chance to avenge that defeat against the Retrievers on Saturday. Anthony Lamb was the league's player of the year after leading the conference in scoring (20.8 points per game) and rebounds (8.0 per game).
64. Northern Kentucky Norse 
John Brannen's Norse are in the tournament for the second time in three seasons after winning the Horizon League final on Tuesday. Senior Drew McDonald (19.3 points, 9.5 rebounds per game), who was on the team when NKU gave Kentucky all it could handle back in the 2017 tournament, will get another opportunity in the spotlight.
65. Liberty Flames
The Flames got the college basketball world's attention when they hammered UCLA back in December. The Atlantic Sun tournament champs are going to play slowly (they're 349th in adjusted tempo, per KenPom), and they're going to make shots -- 56.9 percent on 2s and 77.9 percent at the line are both top-10 nationally.
66. Bradley Braves
Bradley won three close, low-scoring games to take the Missouri Valley Conference crown, and tight, half-court defense is going to be its M.O. in the NCAA tournament as well. MVC opponents shot just 31 percent from 3-point range against the Braves, and Bradley allowed just 39 made 2-point baskets in the entire conference tourney.
67. Iona Gaels 
Tim Cluess has Iona in the tournament for the fourth straight year and sixth time in the past eight, and this group of Gaels can really score. Iona has four double-figure scorers, and point guard Rickey McGill (15.5 points per game) and forward E.J. Crawford (17.9 points per game) have each reached double-figures in their past eight games.
68. Gardner-Webb Bulldogs 
The Bulldogs are going dancing for the first time in school history, and a team that beat both Georgia Tech and Wake Forest in the nonconference is not going to fear a bigger-conference foe. Tim Craft's group shoots it well: 37.7 percent on 3s and 53.8 percent on 2s heading into the NCAA tournament.

26269338,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Two minutes is all it took.
Zion Williamson had been gone for a month following a knee injury against North Carolina. Six games of frustration -- including three losses -- for Duke and a whirlwind of debate about the freshman superstar's future filled the void. And then, two minutes into Duke's 84-72 win over Syracuse in Thursday's quarterfinals of the ACC tournament, Williamson reminded the basketball world of what it had been missing.
Williamson stole an outlet pass, dribbled downcourt, leapt from just inside the foul line and delivered a powerful tomahawk dunk. Cellphone cameras flickered, the crowd erupted and it felt as if Williamson had never been gone. And that was just the start.
The Duke freshman finished the game shooting 13-of-13 from the field, tying the ACC record for most makes without a miss. His 29 points led all scorers, and his five steals set the tone on defense. He also had 14 rebounds, becoming the first Duke player to post a 25-10-5 line since Christian Laettner in 1992, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.
Zion Williamson made all 13 of his shots, five on high-flying dunks, and scored 29 points in his return to lead No. 5 Duke to an 84-72 victory over Syracuse on Thursday night in the Atlantic Coast Conference quarterfinals.
A month ago, there was debate about whether Williamson should return at all. On Thursday, he said he wouldn't have had it any other way.
""Everybody has their right to an opinion, but I knew I was coming back the whole time,"" Williamson said.
The Duke freshman said he wasn't aware of his perfect shooting night until a team manager informed him afterward, and he downplayed the success by noting he ""couldn't throw a tennis ball into the ocean"" from the free throw line (2-for-9). But Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim turned up the hype machine where Williamson wouldn't.
""I've been in this game over 50 years, and I've seen some great players,"" Boeheim said. ""I'm not saying he's better than those guys, but he can do things nobody has done in this game. He's crazy. He's a different type of player. There's not guys like him.""
Jay Bilas breaks down Zion Williamson's impact for Duke in his first game back vs. Syracuse.
Williamson, who won the ACC's player of the year award despite missing the final month of the regular season, changed the dynamic on both ends of the court for a team that struggled to find an identity without him. His five steals opened the transition game for Duke, and he helped the Blue Devils dominate the Orange in the paint. Perhaps as important for Duke, he proved he is healthy enough to change the dynamic against North Carolina in the third installment of the rivalry this season, which comes Friday in the semifinals.
Williamson was asked after the game how eager he had been to get back. Mike Krzyzewski interrupted the answer.
""How about how badly I wanted him out there?"" the Duke coach said.
Not that Williamson's return wasn't without controversy.
After another Williamson dunk, about eight minutes into the game, Syracuse's Frank Howard extended his leg in what appeared to be an effort to trip the Duke star as he retreated down the court on defense. The move created a stir on social media, and broadcasters blasted the move during the game. Afterward, however, Boeheim was quick to defend his player, calling it a ""manufactured"" story and saying there was no trip.
Howard offered a similar rebuttal, saying he had no intention of injuring Williamson and pointed to his career at Syracuse as evidence he is not a dirty player.
""I mean, if you said I tried to trip him, I don't get it,"" Howard said. ""I realized I tripped him, and I tried to give him a little hand at the same time. I mean, it's the heat of the game with a very tough defender on me, and I was trying to get open, get the ball and get the ball out fast. ... He's a hell of an athlete and a hell of a player. I have a lot of respect for him. I'm not going to wait four years to get to this stage to start tripping people.""
For his part, Williamson said he wasn't aware of the tripping incident until after the game and seemed perplexed by the controversy. He did, however, have a lot to say about the heated debate regarding his sneakers that followed his February injury.
Williamson was wearing Paul George Nikes, which tore open during a spin move on the opening possession of Duke's loss to North Carolina on Feb. 20. Williamson said it was the second time he had blown out a Nike shoe, after ripping through the toe of a Kyrie Irving model during the summer.
After the high-profile injury, however, Nike sent representatives to Duke to meet with Krzyzewski and Williamson, then traveled to China to work on manufacturing a modified version of the Kyrie 4 shoes with additional padding. Williamson also was told to rotate shoes more frequently.
Nike issued a statement Thursday in advance of Williamson's return: ""We're thrilled to see Zion returning to the court. After working closely with the Duke Basketball team to examine the issue, we are confident this was an isolated incident. We continue to work with Duke, and all of our partner programs, to ensure we are providing the best product for their athletes.""
Krzyzewski offered his support for the brand, too.
""We think it's the best shoe or else we wouldn't be with them,"" Krzyzewski he said.

26032761,"Duke and Syracuse will take the floor on Saturday (6 p.m. ET, ESPN) after a difficult week for both programs. Also, a whole mess of key men's basketball games dot the Big Ten schedule, culminating in Sunday afternoon's in-state battle between Michigan and Michigan State in Ann Arbor.

Emotions are going to be high on both sides of this week's Duke-Syracuse matchup. How do you see it playing out on the floor?Myron Medcalf, senior college basketball writer: This is a difficult situation for everyone involved. I'm not sure how players, coaches and others attached to this game will process everything that surrounds it. I wouldn't be surprised by a Syracuse upset, although I think Duke will win. Zion Williamson is the most effective player Duke has to put in the middle of that zone, but he seems unlikely to play. And that could lead to another 3-point barrage for a Duke squad that has connected on 29.2 percent of its 3-point attempts in ACC play. Still, RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish will cause problems for Cuse.Jeff Borzello, college basketball insider: This one is really tough to read due to the emotions of this week. There are questions about Williamson's availability, and there are questions about whether Jim Boeheim will coach. (ed. note: Syracuse announced Friday afternoon that Boeheim will coach). On the floor, though, Syracuse goes for the sweep of the Blue Devils. In the first meeting, it was sort of a perfect storm for Syracuse: Tre Jones injured after six minutes, Reddish not playing, Duke going 9-for-43 from 3-point range. This time around, Williamson likely will be very limited even if he plays and the Blue Devils looked awfully vulnerable without him against North Carolina on Wednesday -- at both ends of the floor. That said, I still don't see Duke losing two in a row. There's too much talent on that roster and they've now had a few days to adjust to life without Zion.Editor's PicksHow we rank the top seven conferences in college basketballWe evaluated the top seven conferences in college basketball based on four distinct factors.Bubble Watch: Which teams could be left outHere's your updated source for all of the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.Power Rankings: What do the committee's power ranks look like?Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?2 RelatedJohn Gasaway, college basketball writer: May I repeat one thing Jeff said about the first game? Duke shot 43 times from beyond the arc, and the Blue Devils missed 34 of those. Now, granted, the game went to overtime, but that's still a lot of perimeter shooting. The interesting thing is, even without Jones in the lineup, Duke was able to get inside the zone and make about 60 percent of its 2s. Shot selection and success will even out this time and the Blue Devils will win.Jordan Schultz, insider/analyst: Duke wants to exact a dose of revenge, and even with Zion's health in question, I don't love the Orange's chances. Defensive maestro Jones and big-shot-maker Reddish are both in the lineup. More importantly, we should expect a monstrous showing from Barrett, who went 8-for-30 and a miserable 4-for-17 from 3 in the first meeting. Give me the Blue Devils.Meanwhile, the Big Ten has a whole bunch of meaningful games this weekend, capped off by Michigan State at Michigan on Sunday. Who ya got in Ann Arbor? Borzello: Give me Michigan. Had Nick Ward been healthy, I think it would have been a toss-up, but I just don't see how Michigan State can consistently score against the Wolverines' defense without Ward. There's going to be a lot on Cassius Winston's plate, and Michigan has one of the best defensive point guards in the country in Zavier Simpson. I see a fairly low-scoring home win for the Wolverines.Medcalf: Winston is an All-American, but he's missing Ward and that matters. What else matters? I'm still not sure how good this Michigan State team really is, which is an even bigger concern with the recent injuries. Its résumé is anchored by wins over Wisconsin, Texas, Iowa and Purdue, but I think Michigan has a higher ceiling than those squads and the Wolverines are playing top-three defense right now, so I'm picking the Wolverines.Gasaway: I like the Spartans in this one. Tom Izzo's guys won at Wisconsin with Ward having a very normal and unspectacular 24-minute cameo. MSU, as always, has options at that spot (Xavier Tillman), and the Michigan offense hasn't flashed the old high-efficiency, 2013-vintage statistical look against an at-large-caliber opponent since the Purdue game on Dec. 1. Short-handed MSU pulls the upset.Schultz: Not only is this game in Ann Arbor, but Michigan is the better, healthier team. Ward is the type of physical paint presence that Izzo's best teams always seem to have. He is not replaceable. Michigan, meanwhile, will lean on its leading scorer in freshman forward Ignas Brazdeikis, whose offensive versatility now becomes that much more of an issue for Sparty without Ward.Fill in these blanks: Out of 353 Division I teams, I'm most shocked that ______ isn't better, and that ______ is as good as it is.Medcalf: Clemson and Purdue. Marcquise Reed, Shelton Mitchell and Elijah Thomas all returned this season with ACC contention aspirations after a Sweet 16 run. But the Tigers have damaged their postseason hopes with a 5-8 start in ACC play and committed turnovers on nearly 26 percent of their possessions in the ACC. And I still can't understand how Matt Painter is chasing a title in America's deepest league after losing one of the nation's top senior classes. Despite losing every top-five scorer not named Carsen Edwards, Purdue's offense is still in the top five and its defense has maintained a similar top-40 clip too.Borzello: Oregon and VCU. I was outrageously high on Oregon coming into the season. I even had it in my preseason Final Four (even though I've tried to get that document redacted and scrubbed off the interwebs). But the Ducks, like pretty much everyone else in the Pac-12, stink. Some of it is Bol Bol's injury, but look, they lost to Texas Southern at home with Bol scoring 32 points. On the other side, I think an easy answer is Houston, but let's show some love to Mike Rhoades and VCU. The Rams were picked seventh in the preseason Atlantic 10 poll, but they're atop the league standings and also have a case for an at-large bid. The Rams have an elite defense and they've won seven in a row.Gasaway: Miami and Texas Tech. Maybe I didn't pick the Hurricanes for the Final Four, but there wasn't a doubt in my mind they'd be a tournament team. Basically, I thought we'd get the version of the Canes we saw in the overtime loss at North Carolina. Instead, opponents are finding success scoring in the paint, and Jim Larranaga's guys are nothing special in terms of shooting from either side of the arc. On the flip side, there's no way I expected Texas Tech to be in contention for a top-four seed. Chris Beard is a wizard. I feel like my preseason read on the Red Raider offense was about right, and also that it hasn't mattered one bit. Beard's defense has rendered that whole question moot.Schultz: Indiana and Washington. The Huskies' 12-1 league record is its best since 1953, and coach Mike Hopkins is an absolute star. Senior wing Matisse Thybulle -- who averages a potentially record-breaking 3.4 steals and 3.1 blocks per game -- is a defensive genius and the key to the Huskies' 2-3 matchup zone. Additionally, senior big man Noah Dickerson is a load underneath, while sophomore guard Jaylen Nowell (16.5 points per game on 51.5 percent shooting) is a bona fide pro. Meanwhile, while the Big Ten has a host of tournament teams, much to my surprise, Indiana is not one of them. The Hoosiers have been atrocious, dropping 11 of their past 12 games. Blue-chip freshman Romeo Langford has flashed, but Archie Miller's team has been far too undisciplined and lackluster offensively (104th in efficiency, per KenPom, 215th in possessions) to generate any sort of consistencyESPN.com expert picks for this weekend's top games(Lines, published as they become available, from the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook.)

26137104,"The basketball season ends well before Currie formally starts his new job on May 1, so retiring AD Ron Wellman said he will make any major decisions ""if there are major decisions to be made"" -- with both men saying Monday they'll keep an open line of communication during the transition.
Wellman and Currie spoke a day after the school announced the retirement of the longest-tenured AD in Division I and its selection of Currie, a Wake Forest alumnus and Wellman protégé who ran the departments at Kansas State and Tennessee, as his successor.
The moves come with one of the school's highest-profile programs at a crossroads, and the official transition date falls several weeks after the Demon Deacons' season wraps up.
""I'll be the one making those decisions, but there will be communication between John and me, for sure,"" Wellman said.
Currie said he has confidence in whatever Wellman, who took over at Wake Forest in 1992, decides to do.
""Ron Wellman has made a career of incredible decisions for Wake Forest"" and at his other schools, Currie said. ""I have extraordinary trust and respect for Ron and President (Nathan) Hatch, and as we go along the road, I'm sure that I'll be clued in when I need to be.""
The situation in men's basketball certainly will need to be addressed -- one way or another.
Coach Danny Manning is 65-90 overall and 24-64 in Atlantic Coast Conference play with one NCAA tournament appearance in five seasons. Barring a miracle run in the postseason, the Demon Deacons (11-17, 4-12) are headed for their seventh losing season since 2010 -- also the last year they finished above .500 in the league.
Nearly half of Manning's losses here (44) have come by double figures. Of the 17 losses this season, nine have been by at least 20 points. That includes the worst loss in the three-decade history of Joel Coliseum -- a 95-57 setback to North Carolina last month -- but doesn't include head-scratching home defeats by Houston Baptist and Gardner-Webb that, at least, were close. And the Demon Deacons still have to play No. 4 Duke and No. 14 Florida State later this week.
This year's team entered Monday night's games ranked last in the league in seven major stat categories, including scoring defense, scoring margin, shooting percentage, shooting percentage allowed and assist-to-turnover ratio.
Manning has said part of the problem is youth, with only one scholarship player -- junior Brandon Childress -- remaining from the 2017 team that reached the NCAA tournament's First Four.
Complicating matters, Manning received a contract extension before last season, but Wellman did not disclose the terms or the length of the deal, as is customary at the private school.
And the lack of recent success in men's basketball threatens to undercut the success the department is enjoying in other areas.
Dave Clawson's football program has won three bowls in three years, the men's tennis team won an NCAA title in 2018 -- one of five team national titles Wake Forest has claimed since Wellman took over -- and the school ranks No. 6 nationally and tops in the ACC in the standings for the Director's Cup, given to the top overall athletic department.
Plus, several new facilities are sprinkled across campus, from the football program's indoor practice facility that opened in 2016 to the sports performance center and new basketball practice building scheduled to open later this year.
But men's basketball has long been the signature sport in the ACC, and there's no denying Wake Forest has lagged behind over much of the past decade.
""It needs to be resolved,"" Wellman said. ""We need to do better, and I am confident that we will.""

26042130,"DURHAM, N.C. -- Duke freshman sensation Zion Williamson was forced out of Wednesday night's game against rival North Carolina after just 36 seconds with what Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski called a ""mild knee sprain.""
After Duke star Zion Williamson left Wednesday's game against North Carolina with an apparent knee injury, Caesars Palace lengthened the Blue Devils' odds of winning the national title from +200 to +250.
Duke's Zion Williamson left the game with an apparent knee injury after breaking his left shoe and NBA players reacted on social media.
What did Duke's other two stars show with Williamson out?
Williamson grabbed his right knee in pain after slipping awkwardly and falling when his left Nike basketball shoe fell apart as he planted hard while dribbling near the free throw line on the opening play. The blue rubber sole ripped loose from the white shoe from the heel to the toes along the outside edge, with Williamson's foot coming all the way through the large gap.
He walked off with a slight limp but under his own power before heading back to the locker room with no shoes on his feet.
""I was right there and I didn't really see what happened,"" said fellow Duke freshman Tre Jones, who was next to Williamson on the court at the time of the injury. ""I just thought he'd twisted his ankle or his knee. But when he took his shoes off, I thought maybe something else was going on.""
After the game, an 88-72 Blue Devils loss, Krzyzewski said that Williamson's knee was stable and that a timetable for his return would be determined Thursday.
Former President Barack Obama, sitting along the baseline near the Duke bench, shouted out encouragement to Williamson as he left the court.
Williamson was wearing the Nike PG 2.5, Thunder star Paul George's signature shoe from the fall, in a Duke exclusive colorway.
Duke is four years into a 12-year deal with Nike as the exclusive supplier of uniforms, shoes and apparel. The private school didn't disclose terms of the 2015 contract extension. Nike has had an exclusive deal with the university since 1992.
Mike Krzyzewski doesn't know the timetable after Zion Williamson's knee injury and laments losing another big player early in a Duke loss.
""We are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery,"" Nike said in a statement. ""The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance. While this is an isolated occurrence, we are working to identify the issue.""
Duke looked lost without Williamson. Meanwhile, North Carolina took advantage of the Zion-sized hole in the lane, scoring 32 of its first 34 points in the paint and finishing with a 62-28 scoring advantage there. The Tar Heels never trailed, pushed their lead to 22 with about 16 minutes left and held on.

""It put everyone in the position of having to figure it out, playing without him, while playing a really good team. It's not a good situation,"" Krzyzewski said. ""At halftime the realization that he's not there settled in. And we played horrible to start the second half. The final 16 minutes I thought we played really well, but it was too late.""
Williamson, the ACC's second-leading scorer at 22.4 points per game, has established himself as arguably the most exciting player in college basketball with his array of dunks and once-in-a-generation athleticism.
""It was the first time we've not played with him all season,"" Duke freshman forward Cam Reddish said. ""We miss him as a player, but it's not just that. He is also the source of our energy. So, without him on the floor, that energy is missing. We have to be back in the gym tomorrow, figuring out how to find that energy while he is gone. However long that is going to be.""
Duke next plays Saturday at No. 18 Syracuse (6 p.m. ET on ESPN).

26228387,"AUBURN, Ala. -- We might still be talking about Jared Harper's dunk against Xavier in overtime of the Maui Invitational if it weren't for generational dunkers Zion Williamson and Ja Morant performing acrobatics on our televisions for the past five months.
But what Auburn's point guard did in November deserves another look.
Harper, who checks in at just 5-foot-11, knifed through the lane, took a step into what should have been a one-on-four wall of defense and instead soared past everyone to slam home one of the most jaw-dropping baskets you'll ever see. It was beautiful and savage all at the same time.
His stare afterward -- an ice-cold look familiar to those who know him best -- seemed to say we should have seen it coming. But what made it so special is that no one did. His father stood up in the stands, stunned into silence by what he'd just seen. Meanwhile, his high school coach went absolutely bonkers back in Atlanta, running around his home with his 8-year-old son screaming at the top of their lungs. Auburn's bench was thrown into such a tizzy that players feigned holding one another back from rushing the court.
DVRs went to work across the country, rewinding the play over and over again. There's a very good chance it ended up somewhere on your social media feed.
""I'm sure that opened a lot of eyes,"" Harper told ESPN last month. ""It was great being able to showcase how good a player I am. I'm 5-11, but I'm still able to dunk on someone. That's just another reason that keeps me pushing to show I can do anything.""
Auburn coach Bruce Pearl describes Harper -- the streaking Tigers' floor general -- as having an air of confidence, which is appropriate because there's no noise or look-at-me antics to draw upon. But get near him, talk to him, and there's no mistaking the unflinching belief he has in himself. You may see him as 5-foot-11; he doesn't. The day after his dunk against Xavier, he tried to posterize Mr. Slam Dunk himself, Williamson. And there are those bleeding orange and blue who believe Harper might have done it, too, had Williamson not fouled him. Pearl chased down the refs to chastise the non-call, despite what appeared to be contact before the block. Harper finished with 22 points and six assists.
You'd think a player with those numbers and that dunk on his resume would be a household name, but he's not. Because of his size, because he doesn't play at a college basketball powerhouse and because he doesn't make top-10 plays every week like Williamson and Morant, he's largely overlooked nationally.

Ask Pearl, though, and he'll tell you to pay attention. He'll tell you all about Harper's ""off-the-charts"" athleticism -- how his three-quarter court sprint clocks in at 3.15 seconds, and how, on approach, his vertical is 42.5 inches.
""Pound for pound,"" Pearl said, ""Jared is one of the top players in the SEC.""
On offense, he's in complete control. Ditto on defense. His will to win has turned a perennial cellar-dweller into one of the conference's better programs. Last season, he was the most important piece of an undermanned team that was rocked by scandal and still somehow managed to win a share of the SEC championship and reach the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 15 years. This season, it has been more of the same. He's still the team's linchpin, as Auburn is poised to make back-to-back tournament appearances for the first time in 31 years.
THERE'S A THEME that comes up when you speak to those closest to Harper: He has plans.
Take last month, for instance. At the time he spoke to ESPN, his team was reeling, having lost six of its previous 11 games, and he made a statement that sounded more like a promise. ""We're ready to go on a run,"" he said. And it happened. Auburn went out and won six of its next seven, including last week's tilt on the road at rival Alabama in which the Tigers trailed by 13 points in the second half. Harper came up big during the final 2:32, getting a key steal and scoring six of his team's final 10 points.
His performance, according to Pearl, was just as you would expect. Put the ball in his hands, he said, and ""get out of his way.""
After upsetting No. 5 Tennessee, Auburn's players share the moment with the home crowd.
On Saturday against No. 5 Tennessee, Harper's 16 points and eight assists helped the Tigers upset the Vols en route to their fourth straight win.
""He's had four great games, in many ways put the team on his back,"" Pearl said after the game. ""It's the responsibility of a quarterback to make plays and he's been exceptional.""
But you have to go back further to truly understand how Harper arrived at this point in his life, as the leader of an SEC program and the conference's second-leading assist man. You have to start with his father and how he was raised in the game.
Back when Patrick Harper was a similarly undersized point guard at Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina, he and his friends would talk about becoming parents one day and how they'd raise their sons to play the sport they loved. And when little Jared Harper was born, it wasn't long before a Nerf hoop showed up and completely took over the dining room. It was there that Patrick marveled at how his son could dribble a ball in both hands simultaneously.
But he knew that the road to competitive basketball -- if that's what Jared ultimately wanted -- wouldn't be easy since it was unlikely he would surpass 6 feet tall. So early on, the sport was taken seriously. Jared would learn to play the saxophone and baseball and even turned an unassisted triple play once, but basketball was always the primary focus. Coaching his son's AAU team in the third grade, Patrick would refer to tournaments as ""business trips."" Jared was taught not just to know the ins and outs of his position, but all five spots on the floor.
To get him used to being undersized and playing through it, Patrick allowed his son to play up in competition. He'd play sixth graders in the fourth grade and seventh graders in the fifth. He enrolled him in a private school that allowed him to compete on junior varsity even though he was only in the sixth and seventh grade.
""Was it hard? Was it challenging? Yes, it was,"" Patrick said. ""But he toughed it out.""
More than just the physical side of the game, Patrick wanted him to understand what went into each level of basketball. His idea, he said, was to show Jared a ""future for himself."" So in grade school they'd visit basketball showcases like Nike's Peach Jam, and in middle school they'd attend high school state championships. Later, in high school, they'd drive to Nashville to watch the SEC Championship Game.
After every season, Jared said he would make sure to take stock of what he'd accomplished. And more importantly, he'd figure out what he wanted to do next. What started out as a goal of competing for a state championship morphed in Division-I scholarship aspirations.
Kennesaw State was the first to offer and Ole Miss later showed interested. It wasn't until his junior season, during a game against Douglas County, that newly minted Auburn coach Bruce Pearl showed up on campus. What Pearl saw was a special talent -- someone who could shoot, dribble and wasn't afraid to get physical fighting for position under the basket. There was a confidence about him that Pearl couldn't get enough of.
Pearl had come to watch Brandon Robinson, who would wind up at North Carolina, but was blown away by Harper instead. He turned to his assistant in the stands and told him, ""If we don't try to get him now -- right now -- he won't make it through the summer.""
Jared visited Auburn with his dad and Pearl sold the program hard. Thinking he might favor staying home and going to Georgia, Pearl brought up the notion that then-coach Mark Fox didn't go for smaller guards. The fact that Jared was 5-foot-11 didn't bother Pearl at all.
Jared committed to Auburn and, like Pearl predicted, raised his profile further when he won MVP of Peach Jam that summer. Before his freshman year, Pearl told fans that he didn't know if the team would be good but promised Jared would be ""worth the price of admission.""
""And I think I undersold,"" he said.
WHATEVER HIS FATHER did to teach him the game, it worked. Washington believes Harper is the most intelligent player he's ever coached. Then there's Pearl, who thinks Harper is more developed than some coaches -- himself included.
""It's a challenge to coach someone who's smarter than you,"" Pearl said. ""Jared has a great basketball IQ.""
And part of that is having great recall, apparently.
Last year, Washington was at practice coaching Harper's younger brother when they had a question. They were trying to remember a specific type of zone play they wanted to run, but were coming up empty. They'd run the defense only once, and it was during Harper's time at Pebblebrook. So they called him out of the blue to see if he could remember.
As soon as Washington could finish his sentence, Harper rattled off the exact play. Not just that, Washington said, but he added instructions about ""how you should do it."" ""He hasn't played for me in three to four years,"" Washington said. ""It just blows your mind.""
Because he knows every detail of the game plan and because he has thoughts of his own, it's no wonder Washington trusted him with so much of the offense. At Pebblebrook and now at Auburn, he has been in complete control.
""You don't want to put restraints on players like that,"" Washington said. ""It's like working with a scientist, you don't want to limit them on the exploration of things.""
Jared started 30 games as a freshman, but truly skyrocketed last season as a sophomore. It's hard for coaches to put a finger on exactly what changed from year to year, but the combination of competing with Davion Mitchell and the time he spent working out with NBA star Damian Lillard in Portland during the summer has the feel of a sea change.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
Thirty-two conferences, 292 games. Want to watch them all? We got you.
Here's what's real and what's fake about LSU's athletic director making the right call, and why the obsession with mediocre Power 5 schools is detrimental to the tournament.
After gaining All-SEC Second Team honors, Jared put his name in the draft and worked out for the Atlanta Hawks before deciding to return for his junior season. Pearl expects that, regardless of where Auburn finishes, he'll do the same after this season.
His size will keep some teams from considering him, Pearl said, but that doesn't mean he won't be a pro. He's not averaging 15.2 points, 5.8 assists and 2.6 steals per game on accident. To get to the next level will be about fit. There are only two sub-6 foot players in the NBA, and Pearl expects Jared to join them soon.
""You can rarely point in a game where he couldn't do something because of his size,"" Pearl said. ""He can pass out of ball screens. He can shoot over length. He can finish at the rim. He probably needs to finish tough 2s, whether it's his float game or in the paint. I'd say that's the one thing, the last chapter, of his development, because he has everything else.""
Harper has studied the likes of Lillard, Jeff Teague, Kemba Walker and Mike Conley. This season, he has shown off an extended 3-point range that goes as far out as the logo.
He may not have scouts drooling like Williamson or Morant, but he has a desirable skill set. And if you get stuck on 5-foot-11, just go back to what happened in Maui. Remember the dunk. If he can do that, who's to say what he can't do?

26034361,"Purdue superfan Tyler Trent, who died in early January from a rare form of bone cancer, was honored Tuesday by a fellow Boilermaker who completed a nearly 100-mile walk from West Lafayette, Indiana, to Bloomington for the team's game against the rival Indiana Hoosiers, raising more than $20,000 in the process.
Tyler Trent, who had a rare form of bone cancer, died on Tuesday. The former Purdue University student was 20 years old.
Purdue student Aaron Lai announced the walk on Jan. 20 in an effort to raise awareness for Trent's story and cancer research. Lai never met Trent but said he reminded him of his grandfather, who had lung cancer.
Many first learned about Trent and his connection to the Boilermakers football team when he correctly predicted Purdue's upset of Ohio State on Oct. 20 during a feature on him on ESPN's College GameDay.
Lai began his trek before dawn Sunday morning from West Lafayette.
With a belly full of oatmeal and several layers of clothes, he's off! @alai2016 just began his 100 mile walk from WL to Bloomington for @theTylerTrent. He will arrive Tuesday afternoon for @BoilerBall vs @IndianaMBB. Special report Tuesday on @WLFI. #TylerStrong #NeverGiveUpT2 pic.twitter.com/4VWssqec4b
He arrived three days and 99.6 miles later at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall, some 40 minutes before Purdue-Indiana tipped off. Tyler's parents, Tony and Kelly Trent, were there to welcome him.
What a moment! Aaron Lai's 100 mile journey comes to an end..with an open-armed welcome from @TonyTrent10 and @Kat9798. Aaron's  journey has raised more than $18,000 for the #TylerTrent Cancer Research Endowment. All I can say is: Awesome! #TylerStrong pic.twitter.com/tV4Hr60t25
Kelly Trent took to Twitter to show her gratitude:
""What an amazing young man you are and what an accomplishment. Just WOW! Words are inadequate for our gratefulness for your sacrifice.""
As of Tuesday night, Lai's Go Fund Me -- ""A Walk for Tyler Trent"" -- had raised more than $21,000, easily surpassing its $10,000 goal. Money raised would benefit the Tyler Trent Cancer Research Endowment, and will be matched by the Walter Foundation, according to Lai.
Purdue won Tuesday night's game 48-46 on a tip-in with 3.2 seconds left.

26076501,"From timeouts to fouls, clock details and NCAA rules, we asked our coaches what they'd change, if they could.
Fran Fraschilla: I am a big advocate of international basketball and FIBA rules, so there are a few that really tickle my fancy. I would like to see college basketball go to four quarters instead of two halves to bring it into uniformity with the rest of the basketball world. That's a rule that's not likely to happen anytime soon because of television. The TV timeout is so critical to broadcasting games that there's not a good enough reason to eliminate one of those revenue-producing timeouts that would be lost with the change to quarters.

Seth Greenberg and Dan Dakich give you an all-access pass inside the world of college basketball. Listen now!
But the rule that I think will change in the near future (and as early as next season) is the FIBA rule that resets the shot clock off of an offensive rebound. The rule that'll be experimented with this year [in the NIT] will reset the clock to 20 seconds instead of 30 when a team retrieves an offensive rebound. It's already in use with FIBA and the NBA, where the shot clock is reset from 24 to 14. To me, it speeds up the game and allows another opportunity for coaching a play on the offensive end of the court. I believe you should always attack the defense before it gets set.
By the way, give credit to the NCAA for allowing rules experimentation during the NIT. There are enough of these games to give it and the Basketball Rules Committee enough data and information to make intelligent decisions regarding rules changes.
Seth Greenberg: Two things: I'd go back to the five-second closely guarded rule and to the NBA's advance-the-ball-late rule. First the guarded rule: To me, the benefit of ball pressure defensively is important, and I think it'll help our game because I think it'll get people off the ball in short-ball situations. I think the closely guarded rule puts value on teams that can pressure the ball, and it also will help offensively because instead of in late-clock one guy dribbles in for 10 or 15 seconds, now guys have to move the ball on much better offense.
As for advancing the ball, I'd do that because I think that it would create more dynamic endings in the game. It's a one-point game, and instead of having to go the full length of the court, you get a timeout. And if you have a timeout left, you advance to the hash mark. ... I think special situations are so important to college basketball and I think it would create so many more memorable endings.
Dan Dakich: I would not allow live-ball timeouts -- you couldn't call a timeout while the game was going on. You can only call a timeout when the clock is stopped or a guy made a bucket or something. I think that too often the defense gets penalized with people calling timeouts, and too often coaches get bailed out by people calling timeouts. I'd like to see that rule end there.
Who do our coaches think was the star of the Duke-UNC rivalry? Hint: Blood appears to be a factor.
Should a team that's ahead foul with just a few seconds left? We asked our analysts -- one who recalled a time that cost his team an NCAA tournament berth.
A good NC State team made headlines by scoring 24 points last week. We asked the coaches to recall nightmarish games of their own.
Fraschilla: As a stickler for NCAA rules -- particularly in the area of recruiting -- I'd call for more transparency and consistency regarding the punishment for the breaking of NCAA rules in the recruiting and enforcement area. It seems to me that if a college basketball coach violates a major rule, the punishment should be much harsher than it is now -- up to and including a 10-year or even lifetime ban from coaching at the Division I level. Because the majority of coaches are trying to adhere to all of the major rules, it puts them at a huge disadvantage in competing with people who willfully violate them. If one coach cheats, another coach usually gets fired, because they don't have ""good enough"" players.

Greenberg: I would hold people more accountable within the structure today for grassroots and school programs. I think we have overreacted to the FBI investigation -- summer basketball, AAU, is not the evil empire. There's good and bad in every walk of life, and sometimes people make bad decisions. I'd rather see us look to keep the system in place. Not every AAU coach or program is a villain, and not every high school coach is a saint. We're trying to legislate that scholastic basketball is good and AAU isn't, but there's so much good done, and so much opportunity, from grassroots basketball.
Forget about the elite players. There are opportunities for young people for mid-majors, Division II, Division III, chances to continue to fulfill their dreams of playing college ball at whichever level and to get an education. Instead of trying to blow up the system, let's find a way to keep grassroots basketball where it is, but hold people more accountable for their actions and decisions within the confines of what we're doing today.
Dakich: I would let coaches see and visit players as often as they wanted. I think that getting to know players is huge in building relationships and stopping kids from transferring. I really think that the limits we put on coaches hinder things, like evaluating players properly and getting to know them, their families, and who they really are as people. To hell with it for coaches who want to do that work, who want to work harder than other coaching staffs. It might also even the playing field a little bit between the have and the have-nots in recruiting.

Williams said he felt well enough to return to the sideline.
""It's excruciating pain for a little while,"" he said. ""I started feeling a heck of a lot better, but he [Robinson] was up six or seven and I didn't want to jinx it. If we had lost, I would have gone back out there with him. But I didn't want to jinx him at that time, and yes, I'm a little superstitious.

The $300,000 total wasn't disclosed until Allen testified during the $450 million Medicare and Medicaid fraud case involving Philip Esformes, a Miami nursing home mogul. According to Allen's testimony, which was reported on by Law360.com, Allen also testified that Bowman had knowledge of the scheme and became involved after Allen was forced to resign as the Quakers' coach in March 2015. Allen told the jury he set up a separate bank account for Esformes to wire him money and gave Bowman a debit card to access the funds.

26043018,"DURHAM, N.C. -- The world's most infamous pair of basketball shoes just sat there, tucked in purgatory beneath the Duke Blue Devils bench. The left sneaker, the one that had blown apart like an old tractor-trailer tire just 36 seconds into the game to injure the right knee of Zion Williamson, lay in a heap of material atop its righty partner, the one that had managed to keep it together.
Only a few feet away, college basketball's greatest rivalry plowed ahead without college basketball's greatest player. The reviled North Carolina Tar Heels were running away en route to an 88-72 road victory over Duke on Wednesday night. But the crowd of 9,314 at Cameron Indoor Stadium, from Williamson's teammates to Barack Obama, spent the evening chattering not about the lopsided final score but what they had witnessed in the opening moments of the contest.
As the basketball world holds its breath about the Zion Williamson injury, our panel weighs in on what it could mean.
Duke's Zion Williamson made an early exit from Wednesday's rivalry game after suffering a ""mild"" right knee sprain when his left Nike basketball shoe blew out.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
That moment when the outlook of the 2019 college hoops season suddenly became as impossible to foresee as self-destructive footwear.
The incident happened innocently enough, as Williamson was just past the free throw line, his back to the basket and setting up his next move. When he planted his left foot, it came out from underneath his 6-foot-7, 285-pound frame and sent him into a split. He suffered what Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski described as a ""mild right knee sprain"" when that leg tried to find enough balance to counter the crumpling left. The reason he had lost grip with that left foot was that the shoe literally came apart at the seams.
When asked if he had ever seen that happen, Krzyzewski said he had seen plenty of basketball shoes fall apart, though not as dramatically as what he had seen on Wednesday night. Then he admitted he hadn't yet watched the replay that already had been broken down by the outside world like it was the Zapruder film.
Krzyzewski did say that Williamson's feet had been slipping in recent contests, which suggested that he puts a lot of wear and tear on his footgear via the same speed and power that most had come to Cameron Indoor Stadium hoping to witness.
""I was right there and I didn't really see what happened,"" explained fellow Duke freshman Tre Jones, who was next to Williamson on the court when the injury took place. ""I just thought he'd twisted his ankle or his knee. But when he took his shoes off, I thought maybe something else was going on.""
Williamson jerked that left shoe, or what was left of it, off his foot after landing in a sitting position on the floor. When he made it to his feet, the freshman forward favored the right knee as he was helped to the bench by a Duke staffer. As the game resumed, Williamson chatted with medical staff as they tested that knee. After several minutes, Williamson retreated to the locker room in his socks, the shoes having been stuffed under his seat by the staffer. As he rushed away, Obama shouted a word of encouragement.
The shoes became an instant internet sensation for all the wrong reasons. A rival even took a shot at the makers of the shoe, Nike, tweeting, ""Wouldn't have happened in the pumas."" That tweet was deleted as snark turned to sympathy amid the reality that the details of the 18-year-old's injury and status for the remainder of the season remained unclear.
While the basketball world waited for an update on Williamson's condition, his teammates struggled without him. They spent the first half firing up 3-pointers, 20 in all, and missed all but two. The Blue Devils spent the majority of the game facing a double-digit deficit.
""It put everyone in the position of having to figure it out, playing without him, while playing a really good team. It's not a good situation,"" Krzyzewski explained. ""At halftime, the realization that he's not there settled in. And we played horrible to start the second half. The final 16 minutes I thought we played really well, but it was too late.""
Another Duke freshman forward, Cam Reddish, offered his take on Williamson.
""It was the first time we've not played with him all season,"" Reddish said. ""We miss him as a player, but it's not just that. He is also the source of our energy. So, without him on the floor, that energy is missing. We have to be back in the gym tomorrow, figuring out how to find that energy while he is gone. However long that is going to be.""
How long will Zion Williamson be gone? It's the question that will hang over the remainder of the 2019 season like the fog that rolled in over Durham on Wednesday night. When Joe Lunardi posted his nightly ESPN.com Bracketology update, the opening headline read: ""Not enough information yet on Zion Williamson to adjust Duke's status"" as a predicted top seed in next month's NCAA tournament.
""We have to come up with a game plan without him and hope that he comes back soon,"" Krzyzewski said before returning to his locker room, leaving to see Williamson, and then starting to strategize for a trip to Syracuse -- the only other ACC team to defeat Duke this season -- on Saturday. ""When you lose the leading candidate for national player of the year, you have a lot of adjusting to do.""
"
26277655,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- It wasn't hard for Roy Williams to recap what changed between his team's first two matchups with Duke, which ended in dominant North Carolina victories, and what transpired Friday night, with the Blue Devils edging out a 74-73 win that might well have shifted the pecking order for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament.
""The guy that's been hurt came back,"" Williams said, ""put on his Superman jersey and was incredible.""
""The guy,"" in this case, would be Zion Williamson, and North Carolina heard its share about him even before he took the court.
Williamson injured his knee Feb. 20 when his sneaker tore on the opening possession of Duke's first game against the Tar Heels, and the freshman's absence overshadowed a signature win for UNC. Three weeks later, he sat out the regular-season finale in Chapel Hill, and again the Heels dominated. So the question loomed: Would UNC still be the better team with Duke at full strength?
Friday's victory offered an answer of sorts, but not one Williams or the rest of the Tar Heels were ready to affirm with any sense of certainty.
""He adds a different dimension to their team,"" UNC's Cam Johnson said of Williamson's return. ""He does a lot of things they don't have without him, so it kind of changes the way they play offensively. But they ran the same kind of sets, and we got the same kind of shots we wanted as the first two games. He's a great player, and he definitely adds something for their team, but he wasn't our focus.""
North Carolina (27-6) certainly had its chances to win even with Williamson on the court, an opportunity to upend its most hated rival for the third time this season, and a chance to erase the cloud that lingered over its first two victories. Johnson shot a 3 with 18 seconds remaining that could've won it, and he was sure it had when it left his hand.
""I'd have bet $1,000 right there that shot was going in,"" he said, ""but it didn't.""
Nor did Coby White's final jumper, nor Nassir Little's putback attempt. And that was the takeaway for the Heels. Without Williamson, there was no question which team was better. With him, the difference was one shot -- a shot that felt just right leaving Johnson's hand but didn't fall.
And yet, Williamson's impact was something bordering on transcendent. In the first two games combined, Duke (28-5) mustered just 58 points in the paint. With Williamson occupying prime real estate Friday, the Blue Devils had 50 -- the most UNC has allowed in a game in eight years, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.
Williamson finished with 31 points and 11 rebounds -- the first player to post a 25-10 line in consecutive ACC tournament games since Tim Duncan, 22 years ago. His steal that led to a monster dunk was a turning point in the game. His last bucket, after corralling his own miss, was the difference in the final score. His work on both ends of the court made Duke a different team.
""He's able to open it up a lot, and on the defensive end, too,"" Blue Devils point guard Tre Jones said. ""He's able to guard anybody when we switch, and he's on the boards always. He just flies around.""
Williamson helped cover for Cam Reddish, who was minus-11 for the game with five turnovers. And his success in the paint overshadowed RJ Barrett's 5-of-15 shooting night. It could've been Barrett's two misses at the free throw line with 12 seconds to play that defined the game. Instead, it was his decision to pass up a play designed for him and dish to Williamson for the game's final points that proved decisive.
Duke now takes on Florida State on Saturday for a chance at the ACC title. The Blue Devils have just one loss with their full starting five on the court, and that makes a strong case for the NCAA tournament selection committee to put them on the top line and send them to nearby Columbia, South Carolina -- just down the road from Williamson's hometown of Spartanburg.
Or perhaps the first two games against UNC without Williamson still carry weight with the committee. Williams made that case after Friday's loss, noting that ""injuries are a part of it, too.""
Added forward Luke Maye: ""We had a tough loss, but we're still a great team. We've got six more games, hopefully.""
And after Friday's prizefight, it might be that the final decision on which team is better will be made after yet another rematch in the NCAA tournament.
""Would I love to see them? Honestly, if we match up against them, it'll be a great game,"" Williamson said. ""But I'm not going to sit here and say, 'Oh my God, I hope we can play them again.' I'm not starting any extra drama.""

26198799,"Court filings in a federal criminal case involving college basketball corruption link former NC State coach Mark Gottfried to being the first head coach directly connected to impermissible payments to players, sources told ESPN.
According to a disclosure from federal prosecutors, former NC State assistant coach Orlando Early's attorney said his client disclosed that Gottfried on two occasions gave him envelopes -- containing what Early believed was cash -- to deliver to star guard Dennis Smith Jr.'s trainer to ensure he signed with the Wolfpack in 2015.
Smith's trainer, Shawn Farmer, was supposed to deliver the envelopes to Dennis Smith Sr., the father of the five-star recruit, who is now a point guard with the New York Knicks.
According to sources, the allegations concerning Gottfried were included in a sentencing memorandum filed Feb. 12 on behalf of former Adidas executive James Gatto, who was sentenced to nine months in federal prison Tuesday.
The information concerning Gottfried, who is now coaching at Cal State Northridge, is redacted in the sentencing memo that is publicly available.
The sources told ESPN that federal prosecutors initially disclosed the statement from Early's attorney before an October federal criminal trial in New York, in which Gatto and two other men were convicted of conspiring to funnel money from Adidas to the families of high-profile recruits to steer them to Adidas-sponsored programs, including Kansas, Louisville and NC State.
The allegations concerning Gottfried weren't introduced into evidence during the criminal trial.
Scott Tompsett, Gottfried's attorney, disputed the allegations in the disclosure.
""The statement being reported on is false and conflicts with the sworn testimony of the government's lead witness in the trial last fall,"" Tompsett said in a statement provided to ESPN. ""Specifically, at trial, T.J. Gassnola testified, under penalty of perjury, that he did not discuss the payment to Dennis Smith with anyone at N.C. State other than one assistant coach. Thus, the statement being reported on as it refers to Mr. Gottfried is not corroborated by a single shred of evidence and it conflicts with the sworn testimony of the government's lead witness at the trial last fall.""
In a statement tweeted early Saturday, Cal State Northridge said it will cooperate with any investigation but noted Gottfried has denied the claims.
""As part of our hiring process, Coach Gottfried confirmed to CSUN that he had no involvement in, nor knowledge of, any impermissible payments provided to prospective student-athletes during his tenure as a head coach at previous institutions,"" the school said in its statement. ""This affirmation is included in his employment documents and is a condition of employment.""
According to the disclosure, Early, who was Gottfried's top recruiter at NC State from 2011 to 2017, became aware of a request for money from Smith's family to secure his commitment to the Wolfpack.
""Early believes the number was in the ballpark of $100,000 or more,"" the disclosure said.
""Thereafter, on two occasions, Gottfried handed Early envelopes, which Early understood to contain cash,"" the disclosure continues. ""Early in turn delivered the envelopes to Farmer for subsequent delivery to Dennis Smith Sr., the father of Smith Jr.""
At some point, according to the disclosure, Gottfried ""complained to Early about having to provide money out of his own pocket to the Smith family"" and ""stated, in substance, that he intended to ask Adidas for help.""
Early, a college scout for the Memphis Grizzlies, did not respond to a message on his cellphone.
Former Adidas consultant Gassnola testified during the October trial that he made two payments to people close to Smith, who spent one-and-a-half seasons at NC State before being a lottery pick in the 2017 NBA draft.
The first payment, of an unspecified amount, came during Smith's junior year of high school after Andy Miller, who ran the ASM Sports agency, informed Gassnola that Smith wanted to leave the Adidas grassroots circuit.
The second payment came in the fall of 2015, after Early reached out to Gassnola to say there were issues surrounding Smith, who had committed earlier in the fall.
""He was having issues with keeping that situation together,"" Gassnola told the jury.
Gassnola testified he gave $40,000 in cash to Early in November 2015. Early told Gassnola he was going to give the money to Farmer. Gassnola said Adidas reimbursed him the money.
After the $40,000 payment from Gassnola, according to the disclosure, Early removed himself from the situation.
""Gottfried told Early, in substance, that he would take care of the payments to the Smith family himself,"" the disclosure said.
During his testimony at the trial, Gassnola was asked, ""Aside from Mr. Early, did you discuss your plan to pay money to the family of Dennis Smith with anyone else at North Carolina State University?""
""I did not,"" Gassnola answered.
NC State senior associate athletic director Fred Demarest told ESPN on Friday that the university was unaware of the allegations concerning Gottfried.
""If such information exists, it has not been shared with the university,"" Demarest said.
Gottfried, a former ESPN analyst, was fired by NC State after six seasons. He had a 123-86 overall record and 48-58 ACC record at NC State.
Cal State Northridge hired Gottfried as its coach on March 12, 2018. The Matadors are 13-18 (7-8 Big West) going into Saturday night's regular-season finale at UC Irvine.
During his introductory news conference at Cal State Northridge, Gottfried was asked about NC State receiving a federal grand jury subpoena for information about Early and Smith's recruitment.
""I don't foresee any red flags that I'm aware of,"" Gottfried said at the time. ""It's a situation that's much bigger than all of us. It has affected a lot of programs. I'm confident that should be behind us pretty quickly.""
Four days after the Matadors hired Gottfried, NC State officials released a grand jury subpoena they received from the Southern District of New York. The subpoena demanded communication records between school officials and their former coaching staff and Smith and his representatives.
Smith was the ACC Freshman of the Year at NC State in 2016-17. He averaged 18.1 points, the highest scoring average by a Wolfpack freshman. Smith was the ninth pick of the 2017 NBA draft by the Dallas Mavericks and was traded to the Knicks on Jan. 31.
Yahoo Sports previously reported that Smith was among several current and former players who allegedly received money or other impermissible benefits from ASM Sports. Smith reportedly received a loan of $73,500 from Stephen Pina, who was part of the same sports agency as Miller, and Christian Dawkins, who was sentenced to six months in federal prison Tuesday for his role in the Adidas pay-for-play schemes.
Information from ESPN's Jeff Borzello was used in this report.

The Cornhuskers (15-15, 5-14 Big Ten) have at least two games left. They finish the regular season Sunday at home against Iowa and play next week in the Big Ten tournament.
Akenten has been the Huskers' top wing player off the bench. He had one point and three rebounds in 12 minutes in a 91-76 loss at No. 9 Michigan State on Tuesday night. He had 11 points on 5-of-7 shooting in the previous game against No. 7 Michigan.

26024955,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- Duke keeps finding its way back to No. 1.
The Blue Devils reclaimed the top spot in Monday's AP Top 25, the third time this season they've reached No. 1. Duke earned 58 of 64 first-place votes to climb one spot and replace Tennessee, which had spent four weeks at No. 1 but fell to fifth after Saturday's loss at Kentucky.
Duke has now spent nearly half of the season's polls (seven of 16) at No. 1, and hasn't been ranked lower than fourth since the preseason. The Blue Devils (23-2) -- who start four talented freshmen in RJ Barrett, Zion Williamson, Cam Reddish and Tre Jones -- also haven't lost a game at full strength since falling to Gonzaga in the Maui Invitational championship game.
First-place votes in parentheses
Barrett (22.7 points per game) and Williamson (22.4) are the Atlantic Coast Conference's top two scorers, while Jones is second in the league in assists (5.4) while also being one of the nation's best on-ball defenders.
Duke spent two weeks at No. 1 in November after a dazzling performance in a season-opening blowout win against Kentucky. The Blue Devils returned to No. 1 on Christmas Eve and spent four more weeks there, but dropped after an overtime home loss to Syracuse while playing without Reddish (illness) and losing Jones to a first-half shoulder injury.
They had to make a wild comeback from 23 down in the final 10 minutes against Louisville last week to get back to No. 1 this time, just in time for their rivalry game against No. 8 North Carolina on Wednesday.
THE TOP TIER
Gonzaga (25-2) earned the remaining six first-place votes and moved up a spot to No. 2, followed by Virginia and coach John Calipari's Wildcats -- who have made a long climb back after falling from No. 2 following the Duke loss to as low as No. 19 in mid-December.
Nevada, Michigan, UNC, Houston and Michigan State rounded out the top 10.
RISING
LSU made the week's biggest jump, climbing six spots to No. 13 after last week's win at Kentucky. The Tigers (21-4) are tied with Tennessee atop the Southeastern Conference standings and have lost once since mid-December.
Iowa State also made a significant jump, rising four spots to No. 19 after beating Big 12-leading Kansas State.
Twelve teams climbed in the rankings this week, though LSU and Iowa State were the only ones that moved more than a spot or two.
SLIDING
Kansas State fell five spots to No. 23 for the week's biggest slide. And No. 17 Villanova matched Tennessee's four-spot fall after the reigning national champions lost to St. John's at Madison Square Garden.
In all, eight teams fell in Monday's poll.
STATUS QUO
For the first time this season, no new teams joined the Top 25. And five teams stayed in the same spot from the previous poll.
CONFERENCE WATCH
The Atlantic Coast Conference and the Big Ten took up nearly half the spots in this week's Top 25.
The ACC has six ranked teams in Duke, Virginia, UNC, No. 16 Florida State, No. 18 Louisville and No. 20 Virginia Tech. The Big Ten also has six with Michigan, Michigan State, No. 15 Purdue, No. 21 Iowa, No. 22 Wisconsin and No. 24 Maryland.
The Big 12 had four ranked teams -- led by preseason No. 1 and current No. 12 Kansas -- the SEC had three and the Big East had two.

For so many southeastern schoolkids stuck in so many classrooms during so many dark, cold winters, those were the three saviors, but not in that order. With all due respect to St. Nick and school closures, there was no more certain signal that spring had arrived than on the second Friday of March, aka Quarterfinal Friday. That's when your now-favorite teacher rolled that tall, metal multitiered AV cart into the classroom, plugged it in, announced that the first game of the ACC tournament was about to tip off and then soaked in the round of applause that followed.
A 21-inch tube TV, safety-strapped to a top-heavy shelf, its rabbit ears antenna (or coat hanger, tin foil, paper clips, any metal would suffice) pulling in the over-the-air Raycom Sports/Jefferson-Pilot Teleproductions broadcast from the Omni in Atlanta, the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, or the Greensboro Coliseum. There was that rudimentary graphic opening, the basketball court that flew like a Frisbee, set to a way-overcooked '80s orchestral and guitar-infused theme song. And the first commercial break -- hell, every commercial break -- featured the majestic tall ship of Jefferson-Pilot Insurance cutting through the waves as we sang along and dreamed of living long enough to sign up for a policy.
""Sail with the Pilot at the wheel..."" 
The first time I became enraptured in such unhinged round ball ecstasy was on March 11, 1983. That's when Mrs. Cone, my English teacher at West Millbrook Middle School in Raleigh, North Carolina, proudly rolled in the cart she had checked out from the library. She yanked the volume/on-off knob and as the TV set warmed up cut us a deal. If we agreed to sit quietly and watch top-seeded North Carolina take on Clemson, then that's all we would have to do. There would be no discussion of dangling participles or ""My Brother Sam Is Dead,"" but rather Michael Jordan's dangling tongue and his teammate Sam Perkins, who was very much alive.

We watched the second half during lunch, with two(!) carts set up in the cafeteria, and the radio broadcast piped in over an AV system typically only used for the morning announcements. That afternoon, no one had to dress out for gym class if they were willing to sit in the bleachers and watch NC State's one-point victory over Wake Forest. We had no idea that we were witnessing the beginning of Jim Valvano and his Cardiac Pack's legendary run to the national title. We just knew that we didn't have to wear our standard-issue burlap-textured short shorts and play dodgeball.
""Joining us now at halftime here in Atlanta, it's our old friend Dinah Shore. Dinah, don't you just love shopping at Food Lion?""
For three years at West Millbrook Middle, this was my annual March ACC tournament experience. Now, I can only vaguely recall the details of watching semifinals and title games at home or at a friend's house. But those first day, at-school AV cart memories are sharper than the picture on a 1985 Zenith Smart System 3 TV.
""Dan Bonner, I believe Mark Price is taking over this game."" 
""Marty Brennaman, I think you're right."" 
It continued at Enloe High School, located only a cross country team practice run from the NC State campus. Even the staunchest of the school's academicians -- and there were many -- gave in to the temptation of Quarterfinal Friday. Why? Because the Wolfpack's star guard (and current NBA head coach) Nate McMillan had roamed the halls of Enloe just a few years earlier, and yes, he too kept his eyes on the school's TV carts every March.
""Hi, everybody, Mike Patrick here, live from the Greensboro Coliseum, where Lenny Bias and Maryland are set to take on Wake Forest and mighty mite Muggsy Bogues...""
If you did find yourself stuck with a Scrooge who'd decided to take a stand against a day of non-learning, then perhaps you slid a transistor radio into your jacket pocket, dropped an earpiece wire through the sleeve, and spent the entire class curiously leaning into your hand. Before Raycom and Jefferson-Pilot changed the college hoops world through TV market saturation, sneaky radio receivers were the only way to go.
My fourth-grade year at Fred Olds Elementary, a classmate was busted when he suddenly slammed his fist into his desk during a math lesson, knocking his radio out of his desk and smashing it into a pile of junk when it hit the tile floor. Mrs. Crowley walked him into the hallway for an interrogation. We could hear the whole thing. When she asked him why he'd pounded the desk, he told her it was because Duke had a chance to upset Maryland but had blown it. She told him that was a perfectly understandable reason and let him return to class, unpunished.
Wes Durham, son of former Jefferson-Pilot and UNC play-by-play man Woody Durham, grew up in Greensboro and as a fifth-grader convinced his principal to tune into his father's call of the first round North Carolina vs. Wake Forest game on the grounds of civic pride.
""I told her, you know what?"" Durham recalls now. ""This is our city's event. You need to play this game over the PA system in our school. And she did.""
This week Durham will be on the microphone for his 21st ACC tournament, the first 18 as the voice of Georgia Tech and the past three with Raycom.
In the 1980s, as technology started moving faster than Spud Webb on the break, those who really lived out on the edges of life would smuggle a Sony Watchman TV inside of their Trapper Keeper. Even on a two-inch screen flickering from within the darkness of one's backpack, Georgia Tech head coach Bobby Cremins' head of gray hair popped in black and white.
""Today's game is being brought to you by Piedmont Airlines...""
It was always easy to spot the classrooms where a professorial line had been drawn in the hardwood. My friends who were being held against their sports wills could be seen staring longingly out the window of their joyless prison, looking for any sort of score update from those of us who were fortunate enough to be in TV cart-friendly spaces.
I once found myself forced through such a sad looking glass. Mrs. Waner, my sweet but serious literature teacher at Travelers Rest High School, chose to keep us in the hoops dark on Quarterfinal Friday 1989. My family had moved from Raleigh to Greenville, South Carolina, taking us off Tobacco Road and into the shadow of Clemson's Death Valley. This was certainly not college basketball country, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that even in upstate South Carolina, the ACC tourney was still celebrated.
I was not so pleasantly surprised when my team of the time, top-seeded NC State, was upset by unranked Maryland in the opening Friday game. How was I informed of that result? When I looked out the window of Mrs. Waner's room I was greeted by a Clemson orange-donned friend, Matt Austin, jumping up and down in the courtyard to get my attention with a hastily made sign: MARYLAND 71, NC STATE 49. Coach Leach, who was letting his class watch the game right next door, let Austin loose in the courtyard with his sign to taunt me.
I had started my day very angry at Mrs. Waner for not rolling in an AV cart. I ended the class by thanking her for sparing me from the torture being broadcast from Atlanta.
Looking back, I wonder if I should have even been there in the first place. There were always plenty of friends who called in sick for the first round, but magically healed when we met up to watch the weekend games. Then there were those who punted.
""Please send Robert Hogewood and Graham Hunt to the office for early dismissal,"" Robert Hogewood recalled on Twitter. This was the message received by his teachers every second Friday of March. Like Wes Durham, he grew up in the North Carolina Triad and his father, Mike Hogewood, was also a staple of Raycom/Jefferson-Pilot telecasts.
So, why bring all this up this week, for this particular edition of the ACC tournament? Why suddenly so nostalgic for the bygone days of my Tobacco Road youth? It's because this year marks the last time that the tourney games will be brought into homes in the old school, over-the-air antenna ""Sail with Pilot"" fashion. In August, the ACC Network launches in a conference partnership with ESPN.
Now, don't shed any tears for the folks at Raycom. They are going to be just fine, an integral part of the new network with payments that shall be worthy of their work and history. But their TV compound this week, assembled in and around the Spectrum Center only a few minutes from their Charlotte headquarters, will be plenty packed with old stories, laughs and tears as the game clock for Saturday night's championship clicks its way closer to zero.
Durham refuses to take off his old-school Raycom ball cap. Director Billy McCoy is working his 47th consecutive ACC tournament for the company, a streak so long that it predates Raycom or Jefferson-Pilot, starting under C.D. Chesley, the man who birthed ACC broadcasting coverage in 1957. When McCoy reported for work this week, he shocked the crew by shaving off his signature beard.
""My first ACC tournament in 1974 I didn't have a beard so I decided I didn't need one for this one, either.""
On Monday morning, I tweeted out a challenge to the school teachers of the Carolinas, saying that they should pay homage to the past by rolling TV carts into their classrooms for one last rabbit-eared ride.
In honor of the last ACC Tournament on Raycom (and yes, Jefferson-Pilot) any middle or high school teacher on Tobacco Road worth their teaching certificate needs to be rolling these into classrooms this week. pic.twitter.com/h7FfqexR8D
The response was massive. Thousands of people liked or retweeted it. Hundreds responded with their own stories of Quarterfinal Fridays and many copied their former teachers in their response to thank them for checking out an AV cart and pushing aside books for basketballs for one day. I even heard from Coach Leach, the one who'd let my buddy taunt me in '89.
Truck drivers, TV reporters, corporate CEO's, even a couple of Washington politicians, they all checked in with TV cart memories. What that overwhelming response told me was that I was not alone, not in my experiences and certainly not in my nostalgia. I also learned that it was a feeling not confined to the Carolinas, or even the ACC. Fans of the old Big East checked in with similar sneaky schoolhouse radio and TV stories. Many Kentucky Wildcats fans claimed that it was their people who'd invented sneaking radios into class decades ago. Over the years, Raycom expanded its portfolio to include the SEC, Big 12, Big Ten, the then Pac-10 and even the long gone Big Eight, Southwest and Metro conferences. So, the Pilot, he got around. Eventually, the company's March responsibilities boiled back down to the place where it started, on Tobacco Road.
The vanishing of over-the-air regional tournament coverage always had an expiration date, no different than Trapper Keepers, Piedmont Airlines, or the tube TVs strapped atop those big black AV carts. None of that is coming back, just as the ACC is never going back to eight schools. (This is the part where I remind you teachers that the ESPN app will work just fine on your classroom Smartboards.)
But just because we aren't going back doesn't mean that we can't look back. We just can't become so obsessed with the rear view that we miss what's right in front of us. If that beautiful tall ship shown on the TV atop that beautiful tall AV cart taught us nothing, it should have taught us this. When the wind is in your sails, you have no choice to chase the new horizon up ahead.
""Sail with the Pilot...Worries are far behind you. There's really piece of mind, too.""
