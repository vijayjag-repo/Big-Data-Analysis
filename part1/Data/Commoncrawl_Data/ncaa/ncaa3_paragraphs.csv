25812443,"And what does all that chaos mean? Well, we're not sure yet. But the parity within college basketball is clear.
Not one major conference race has produced a definitive front-runner yet, so there is a lot of time for the landscape to undergo some significant shifts in the coming weeks.
Seems like a good time for another edition of what's real and what's fake in college basketball.
The latest Associated Press poll will not stop the conversation about which team deserves the best-squad-in-America distinction. You could make a case for multiple teams. I went to Knoxville last week and watched Tennessee beat Arkansas by 30-plus on Tuesday. Kansas was the last team to beat Tennessee (Nov. 23 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn). Since then, the Vols have accrued wins over five top-100 teams on KenPom.com, including Gonzaga. But they also squandered a significant lead and nearly lost to Alabama on Saturday. Still, it's hard to argue against Tennessee as the top team in the country right now.
Virginia suffered its first loss of the year when it lost at Duke, sans Tre Jones, on Saturday. The expected poll adjustment was to move the Cavs down a few spots. But that's not reflective of Virginia's full résumé. Its one loss (at Duke) is better than the worst losses that Duke (vs. Syracuse), Michigan (at Wisconsin) and Tennessee (vs. Kansas on a neutral court) have suffered this season. The Cavaliers' collection of wins include a 22-point victory over Virginia Tech last week. The NET rankings, KenPom.com and ESPN's BPI all had Virginia ranked first entering the week.
The traditional rivals meet Wednesday with the Tar Heels hoping to impact the ACC race and more.
Kentucky scored an impressive win at Auburn on Saturday, and the data says the Wildcats are legit. Plus, some other college hoops hot takes I can prove.
The Marquette guard isn't built like Zion Williamson -- he's 5-foot-11, 175 pounds. But Howard's collegiate scoring prowess is without recent precedent.
And why does Michigan automatically get dismissed from the conversation following a road loss, the team's first loss of the season, at Wisconsin? The Wolverines have 15 double-digit wins this season.
Then there is Duke.
After Saturday's win over Virginia, Duke has the best series of wins in America: Kentucky, Auburn, Indiana, Texas Tech, Florida State and Virginia. But the ""Duke is No. 1"" folks shouldn't overlook last week's home loss to an unranked Syracuse team that had just lost to Georgia Tech by double digits.
Plus, the sea of emerging programs that can't match the aforementioned résumés but have played some terrific basketball in recent weeks -- Kentucky, Michigan State, Gonzaga -- could compete with any top-10 team on a neutral floor right now.
So where does that leave us? With a bunch of good, quality teams in college basketball and no clear No. 1. Perhaps a team will separate itself in the coming weeks. But that certainly hasn't happened yet.
The Big Ten can't win.
When the league endures years like last season, when it sent only four teams to the NCAA tournament for the first time in a decade, it faces the same backlash as it does in years like this one, when it's a competitive gantlet. The national title drought -- the league hasn't won a championship since Michigan State's run in 2000 -- doesn't help its cause in the minds of detractors.
To some, Michigan's loss at Wisconsin on Saturday was proof that one of the league's powerhouses was overrated, and therefore the rest of the league is, too. To others, it's an illustration of the conference's depth. I choose the latter because the numbers support that. The Big Ten is the only league with 10 top-50 squads in ESPN's BPI. Rutgers might be the league's only ""bad"" team, but Steve Pikiell's team has top-100 wins over Ohio State and Miami.
This Big Ten could send 10 teams to the NCAA tournament. Expect more upsets in conference play, because the Big Ten is just that rich.
When I saw the video of actor Matthew McConaughey telling Texas players to stand and support their teammates during Saturday's win over Oklahoma, I stood up in my living room. That's Rust Cohle from ""True Detective"" Season 1. That's the dude from the Lincoln commercials. You'd better stand up.
But this is actually what Texas wants from McConaughey, the basketball team's new ""minister of culture,"" as it prepares for a move to a new arena in 2021. The school has not defined the actor's official duties. On Saturday, however, it was obvious he's embraced the role.
Kansas' road loss to West Virginia extended the program's troubles in Morgantown, where the Jayhawks have lost five of their past six games. Bill Self lamented his decision to not call a timeout before his final possession in the one-point loss, but the loss highlighted bigger challenges for the Jayhawks.
The Jayhawks have committed turnovers on one-fifth of their Big 12 possessions and made just 64.5 percent of their free throws in league play. Plus, they've made 35 percent of their 3-pointers, a mark outside the top 100 after three consecutive seasons of top-10 accuracy from beyond the arc. Two of those issues -- the Jayhawks committed 18 turnovers and finished 5-for-16 from the 3-point line -- cost them on Saturday.
This is still the team to beat in the Big 12. But here's the concern: Can a Kansas team with six more Big 12 road games still win the league if it fails to clean up some of the issues that fueled a loss on Saturday and could haunt it throughout the coming months?
Again, Kansas is still the team everyone should pick to win the league. But this Jayhawks team is not the slick offensive machine KU has produced in recent seasons.
After Tony Bennett's team lost to Duke on Saturday at Cameron Indoor Stadium, various folks in the Twitterverse offered their weekly reminder that Virginia's head coach should not be defined by last season's 20-point loss to UMBC in the first 16-1 upset in NCAA tournament history or other past postseason challenges.
Well, that's ridiculous. This Virginia team is fancy. De'Andre Hunter, Kyle Guy and Ty Jerome could lead Virginia to an ACC title and a national championship. The Cavaliers are that good. Their regular-season success has never been questioned. Even with the Duke loss, this is still a top-five team.
But we're all waiting to see whether Bennett can avenge last year's embarrassment by turning this impressive regular season into postseason highs. That's just the deal in college basketball.
Bennett is a great coach. But he and others like him are rightfully criticized when they can't find the same gear in the postseason that they've demonstrated throughout the regular season.
So yeah, Bennett and Virginia could win it all and put last year behind them. But if they struggle again, Bennett will have a hard time altering the perception of his program.
Since New Year's Day, Baylor has racked up wins over Oklahoma State, Iowa State and Texas Tech (on Saturday), which helped create the logjam at the top of the conference.
Baylor's top four scorers from last season departed. Tristan Clark, the No. 2 scorer on this season's team, has missed the past three games and will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. And yet, Baylor started the week 3-2 in league play, a record that includes two top-25 wins.
Drew has certainly coached better teams in Waco. This has been one of his most resilient coaching efforts.
With 1:53 remaining in a five-point game, Kentucky's PJ Washington tried to block a dunk attempt by Auburn's Horace Spencer. Washington was going for the ball, but he got still hit with a flagrant 1, largely because Spencer landed awkwardly, cut himself and got up with blood pouring from his face. It was a call that did not fit the NCAA rulebook's description of a flagrant 1. ""A flagrant 1 personal foul is a personal foul that is deemed excessive in nature and/or unnecessary, but is not based solely on the severity of the act."" Nothing about Washington's play was excessive.
A minute after the call, Jared Harper hit a 3-pointer to give Auburn a one-point lead with 32 seconds to play. The flagrant 1 call had shifted the momentum. Kentucky held on to win, but plays like that shouldn't affect outcomes.
Officials have difficult jobs. They won't get every call right. But that's one of those calls that they can't miss.

25885440,"Former South Carolina and Oklahoma State assistant Lamont Evans, who was accused of accepting $22,000 in bribes, entered the plea in New York federal court to conspiring to commit bribery. He admitted receiving $22,000 to steer players at South Carolina and Oklahoma State to certain financial advisers and business managers, attorney Johnny McCray said.
Evans also agreed to forfeit the bribe money he received from two financial advisers as part of the deal he signed Wednesday.
Emanuel ""Book"" Richardson, one of three former assistant coaches arrested in September 2017 as part of the FBI's investigation into college basketball corruption, pleaded guilty Tuesday to one felony count of conspiracy to commit bribery.
Tony Bland, former assistant basketball coach for USC, pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy count Wednesday in a criminal case in which prosecutors said bribes were paid to steer top athletes to certain schools.
""I now know that accepting those funds in exchange for introducing them to any one player was wrong and violated the law,'' he said.
Sentencing was set for May 10 on a charge that carries the potential for up to five years in prison, though a plea agreement between Evans and prosecutors recommends no more than two years behind bars.
Judge Edgardo Ramos also warned that he could be deported because he is a citizen of Barbados, though he lives in Florida. He was a resident of Stillwater, Oklahoma, at the time of his arrest.
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement that Evans abused his position as a mentor and coach for personal gain.
""A scheme Evans apparently thought was a slam dunk actually proved to be a flagrant foul,'' he said.
""He accepted responsibility for what happened,"" McCray said. ""He will be making a vigorous appeal for the lowest sentence possible,""
Two other former assistant coaches -- Arizona's Emanuel ""Book"" Richardson and USC's Tony Bland -- have already pleaded guilty to the same charge. The trio was arrested in September 2017 as part of the FBI's investigation into college basketball corruption.
The two men accused of bribing the coaches -- former Adidas consultant Merl Code and Christian Dawkins, a runner for former NBA agent Andy Miller, are scheduled to go on trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in April.
Code, Dawkins and Adidas executive James Gatto were convicted of federal fraud charges in October for funneling money from Adidas to the parents and/or guardians of high-profile recruits to steer them to sign with Adidas-sponsored schools, including Kansas, Louisville and NC State. They are scheduled for sentencing in that case March 5.
Former Auburn assistant Chuck Person and former NBA referee Rashan Michel are scheduled to go to trial in June. Person is accused of soliciting and accepting $91,500 in bribes from an undercover cooperating witness to influence Auburn players to sign with certain financial advisers.

Which league are you taking in the SEC/Big 12 Challenge on Saturday?Myron Medcalf, senior college basketball writer: I think the SEC is a strong league, but the pairings seem to favor the Big 12, especially the road games for Big 12 teams that should be favored in those matchups. Assuming Kansas State knocks off Texas A&M on the road, Iowa State wins at Ole Miss and Texas wins at Georgia, I could see the Big 12 winning the challenge with a 6-4 or 7-3 edge.Jeff Borzello, college basketball Insider: The SEC caught a bad break with Auburn, LSU and Mississippi State all sitting this one out, while its best team (Tennessee) plays against arguably the Big 12's worst team (West Virginia). As a result, I think it's going to be tough for the SEC to win the challenge. The Big 12 is going to be favored in at least seven of the 10 games, and should have some room for error even if a couple games go the SEC's way.Editor's PicksBilas: The 68 best teams in college basketball ... my gift to youYou can discard the NET and the RPI.

Moreover, the Big 12 is loaded. Kansas aside, Scott Drew's Baylor Bears have posted victories over Arizona, Iowa State and Texas Tech. Speaking of the Red Raiders, Chris Beard is a Coach of the Year candidate -- despite his team's recent woes -- and sophomore guard Jarrett Culver looks every bit like a lottery pick. Additionally, Kansas State might be better than its Elite Eight team last season, while Iowa State, TCU, Oklahoma and Texas could all be tournament outfits.How do you see Kansas @ Kentucky playing out?Medcalf: Well, I'm looking forward to being in Lexington to see it live. Kentucky has had problems with teams that can play efficient four-guard lineups, but so much of Bill Self's success is tied to Dedric Lawson. And I think Lawson will have a big night, probably in front of a lot of family members who will make the six-hour drive from Memphis, but I think Reid Travis, Nick Richards and PJ Washington will wear him down and help Kentucky secure the victory in the final five minutes of an intense game.Borzello: Give me Kentucky. I just have no idea how good Kansas is right now. Kentucky is on fire lately, but to be fair, the last time everyone hopped on the Wildcats' bandwagon (after wins over North Carolina and Louisville), they went to Alabama and lost to an average Crimson Tide team. Kentucky is highly susceptible to teams that can spread the floor and make shots from the perimeter, which is what Kansas was last season -- but not this season. The Wildcats are clicking at the right time, while the Jayhawks still seem to be figuring things out.Gasaway: One shootout at Auburn notwithstanding (and even that was a Wildcats win), Kentucky's looked outstanding on defense in SEC play. So, yes, the Jayhawks are catching UK at the wrong time. (Right now Self's wondering: Where's that version of John Calipari's guys that allows 118 points? Can we play them?) Also, KU has lost games in Tempe, Arizona; Ames, Iowa; and Morgantown, West Virginia. Lexington, Kentucky, might be too tough as well.Schultz: Calipari posts a 95 percent win rate coaching the Cats at Rupp. Just as important, Kentucky is playing its best ball of the season right now. Freshmen blue-chippers Keldon Johnson and Tyler Herro have become reliable perimeter scorers, while sophomore PJ Washington has flashed first-round ability by playing both ends of the floor. Kansas will ultimately be just fine, but the Jayhawks -- sans center Udoka Azubuike -- have been an enigma of late. They got hammered in Ames and then fell to lowly West Virginia in Morgantown. The Wildcats win this game with suffocating half-court defense and plenty of firepower offensively, especially in the open floor.Give us one coach in college basketball who deserves more recognition than he gets.Medcalf: I'll go with Bruce Weber, because Kansas State endured a six-game stretch without Dean Wade and maintained its defensive tenacity.

We've often talked about Chris Beard, Bill Self and even Steve Prohm in that league, but Weber is doing some amazing work in Manhattan, Kansas.Borzello: I'll give two answers. For this season, I think we have to acknowledge what Scott Drew is doing in Waco, Texas. Baylor was picked ninth in the preseason Big 12 poll and a season-opening home loss to Texas Southern seemed to hammer that home. But the Bears are currently 4-2 in the league, including victories over Iowa State and Texas Tech. And maybe this isn't the right season to advocate for Oregon's Dana Altman, but he's annually one of the nation's most underrated coaches.

Now his team's in the top 15, and his only conference loss since the calendar flipped to 2019 came on the road to an opponent that could get a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. I will not rest until Mark Turgeon gets the recognition he deserves at Maryland.Schultz: As Borzello notes, Drew has done an outstanding job in Waco. When I spoke with him around Christmas, Drew felt his team was just starting to hit its stride, in large part because of transfer senior point guard Makai Mason, who now leads Baylor with nearly 16 points per game.

25817310,"Tennessee is the new No. 1 in The Associated Press men's college basketball poll on Monday, climbing two spots to earn their first top ranking since the 2007-08 season.
The Volunteers received 48 of 64 first-place votes from a media panel in the poll released Monday, after Duke, Michigan and Virginia all suffered losses last week.
No. 2 Duke received 11 first-place votes, No. 3 Virginia received three and No. 6 Michigan State two. Gonzaga and Michigan rounded out the top five.
First-place votes in parentheses
""The guys playing right now built this thing,'' Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said.
Expectations followed the Vols into the 2018-19 season. With its top six scorers back from a team that shared the SEC title, Tennessee had its highest preseason ranking at No. 6 and was eyeing a deep NCAA tournament run in Barnes' fourth season.
The Vols have lived up to the forecast so far, bouncing back from an overtime loss to then-No. 2 Kansas to win 12 straight games. Tennessee knocked Gonzaga from atop the AP Top 25 with Barnes' first win over a No. 1 team in early December and won its two games last week, rolling over Arkansas and holding off Alabama .
The only other time Tennessee (16-1, 5-0) was No. 1, it lost the next night to Vanderbilt -- the Vols' opponent on Wednesday.
""Tennessee basketball hasn't been ranked No. 1 in a long time,"" Vols guard Jordan Bone said. ""That's a good feeling, but we can't be so locked in on that. We have to continue to stay hungry. We can't be so focused on that. It's so fleeting. It can change really quick.""
Tennessee is the first SEC program outside of Kentucky to ascend to No. 1 in the AP Poll since Florida in 2014.
The changes in the AP Top 25 came quickly after a wild week.
Duke won, Virginia and Michigan lost, Tennessee won but wasn't impressive. Here's what's real and what's fake after a confusing college hoops weekend.
Duke started by losing to Syracuse in overtime at Cameron Indoor Stadium. The Blue Devils played without a sick Cam Reddish and lost point guard Tre Jones to a shoulder injury in the first half.
Reddish returned against Virginia on Saturday and Duke responded with a superb game, knocking Virginia from the unbeaten ranks with a 72-70 victory despite playing without Jones.
Michigan lost to Wisconsin by 10, also on Saturday, leaving the 1976 Indiana Hoosiers as the last Division I team to go undefeated.
In all, 13 ranked teams lost last week, including No. 7 Kansas, No. 8 Texas Tech and No. 9 Virginia Tech. The Jayhawks fell two spots after losing to West Virginia. The Red Raiders dropped six spots to No. 14 after losses to Iowa State and Baylor. The Hokies were down one to No. 10 following a loss to Virginia.
Florida State, after stretching its losing streak to three games with defeats to Pittsburgh and Boston College, fell out of the poll from No. 11.
Kentucky saw a steady slide down the Top 25 after opening the season with a blowout loss to Duke. The preseason No. 2, the Wildcats were down to No. 19 just a month ago, but started climbing again. Kentucky is up to No. 8 after beating No. 14 Auburn and Georgia this week, with games against No. 22 Mississippi State and No. 9 Kansas coming up.
Maryland, winners of seven straight, had the biggest climb of the week, up six spots ahead of the Terrapins' game at No. 6 Michigan State on Monday night and a trip to Madison Square Garden on Saturday to face lowly Illinois. Kentucky, No. 17 Houston, No. 18 Villanova and No. 19 Iowa each moved up four spots.
Louisville moved into the Top 25 for the first time this season at No. 23 following wins over Boston College and Georgia Tech.
Iowa State's wins over Texas Tech and Oklahoma State put the Cyclones back in at No. 24 after they dropped out from No. 20 last week, while LSU beat then-No. 19 Mississippi and South Carolina last week to return to the poll at No. 25.
Oklahoma joined Florida State in dropping out of the poll following losses to Kansas State and Texas. The Sooners were No. 20 last week.
Indiana, No. 25 last week, did not receive a single vote after lopsided losses to Nebraska and Purdue.
"
25871238,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- Rick Barnes will take you to his favorite lunch spot, but not until this tour ends.
Duke won ugly Saturday, making just 2 of 21 3-point attempts. Can the Blue Devils win a title despite long-range struggles?
UK has teased us before, but Saturday's takedown of top-ranked Tennessee was impossible to fake.
Eric Musselman's odyssey has taken him through the basketball hinterlands. At top-10 Nevada, he has reached his destination.
He's the head coach of the No. 1-ranked Tennessee Volunteers, but he also might as well be a Knoxville Chamber of Commerce rep as he weaves past a statue of Pat Summitt, steers down Phillip Fulmer Way and rolls toward Tee Martin Drive in a super-sized SUV that hogs the streets of Tennessee's campus during the school's winter break.
""You gotta see this,"" he says as he ignores the GPS directions to the restaurant, and charts his own course.
Barnes speaks of Knoxville as if he's a proud, longtime resident of this growing city.
The strip on Cumberland Avenue that cuts through campus once featured dilapidated housing and rickety storefronts. Today, it's a modern stretch with high-rise apartments, fast-food restaurants, new sidewalks, trendy steakhouses and microbreweries.
Much like the surrounding area, this phase in Barnes' evolution might be his most promising.
The Vols are a national title-contending, 19-1 team after Tuesday night's win at South Carolina, and that is an event at a school that has never reached a Final Four, much less won a national championship in men's basketball.
Grant Williams is a prime All-America candidate and chasing the Wooden Award. Both he and teammate Admiral Schofield could secure NBA contracts this summer. Tennessee boasts the conference's best offense and its No. 2 defense behind Kentucky -- it beat Gonzaga and Louisville on a neutral floor -- and the Volunteers have taken every SEC opponent's best shot en route to a 7-0 league start.
The man who has engineered it all never expected to be here.
He'd made the NCAA tournament 16 times in 17 seasons at Texas, including a Final Four and a pair of Elite Eight runs. He recruited future NBA standouts Kevin Durant, Myles Turner, LaMarcus Aldridge, Cory Joseph, Avery Bradley and Tristan Thompson. But the Longhorns brass, led by new athletic director Steve Patterson, wanted more.
Barnes never felt secure after Patterson fired Mack Brown, the football coach who won a national title in 2005, even in spite of Patterson's promises to keep Barnes.
""Don't trust him,"" a person close to Barnes warned. They were right. Patterson fired Barnes after a 20-14 season in 2015.
Barnes already knew he had the Tennessee job during his final news conference in Austin. Former Tennessee athletic director Dave Hart had called him following Donnie Tyndall's messy tenure, which ended when the NCAA charged him with various violations at Southern Miss, his former school. (Tyndall subsequently received a 10-year ""show cause""' penalty from the NCAA.)
The hire was not universally praised. Barnes was 61 years old and had his detractors, those who believed Texas' resources should have yielded perennial Final Four appearances, or something close to it. Those naysayers wondered about the fit. They're not wondering now.
Barnes is not in the mood for carelessness during a practice the day before the Vols face Arkansas at Thompson-Boling Arena in mid-January.
That's why sophomore Derrick Walker accepts blame for bobbling a pass and committing a turnover.
""That's on me,"" Walker says as he taps his chest.
""We know it's on you,"" Barnes tells him. ""Everybody in the stands knows that's you! You don't have to say it.""
The Vols practice hard. They're aggressive on every play. Williams, the 20-point-plus scorer with a strong chance to repeat as SEC Player of the Year, collides with a teammate in a scrap for a loose ball. Schofield, the senior forward who averages 16.6 points per game and has 9 percent body fat, already has put himself through two workouts before fighting for rebounds in this practice.
The team's two biggest stars share a bond that is perhaps not evident on the surface.
""I think the most important thing is how we really want to see each other do well, but most importantly we really push each other,"" Schofield says. ""During the summer, people don't think we're friends because of how much we get at each other. Everything's competitive.""
Adds Williams: ""We're two different guys. I enjoy different things. Admiral enjoys different things. For me, I'm more of a nerd. Admiral's more of the cool kid everybody follows. When we realized that's just how I am, the guys are like, 'That's just Grant.'""
For all their differences, Williams and Schofield will tell you they're only here because they survived the spring of 2017.
After Tennessee lost to Georgia in the first round of the SEC tournament that year to finish 16-16 in Barnes' second season, the coach couldn't get settled. On the trip home, Barnes asked his players to name the toughest team in the league.
Every player picked South Carolina, which reached the Final Four that year.
Barnes wondered why they hadn't named themselves. Plus, their demeanor was carefree 20 minutes after they'd hopped onto the bus. At the time, the Vols didn't hate losing the way he has for more than four decades. Too many players seemed more interested in their spring break plans than the season-ending loss in a .500 season.
A frustrated Barnes pulled the team off the bus once Tennessee got back to Knoxville and delivered the bad news.
""We don't have it,"" Barnes told his team. ""We don't have what we need to do. We're getting ready the next three months. We're gonna find out who really wants to buy in.""
After that meeting, Barnes instructed Garrett Medenwald, Tennessee's strength coach, to take the players to a treacherous ramp in a nearby parking garage -- known ominously to all as ""G10"" -- and find out who deserved to keep their scholarships. When the Vols returned from spring break that season, they ran the G10 hill every day. They didn't dribble a basketball for weeks.
""We knew we had to create an environment where we were going to find out who wanted to be on the ship,"" Medenwald said.
The signs of progress became apparent early in the 2017-18 season. The Vols beat Purdue and North Carolina State in the Battle 4 Atlantis in the Bahamas, and they were competitive in a loss to eventual national champion Villanova. Barnes said he could see his team changing on that trip.
""When you start seeing them doing what you're saying, the details, and they start coaching themselves,"" Barnes says, ""that's when it's fun.""
Tennessee continued to ascend, going 13-2 in one late-season stretch and securing a 3-seed in the NCAA tournament -- the program's best showing in 10 years. The Vols beat Wright State in the first round before playing their worst game in weeks and getting caught in the teeth of Loyola-Chicago's Cinderella story.
The way it ended last March has added a sense of purpose for a team that Schofield says is closer than at any time in his four years in Knoxville.
""We're able to critique each other, criticize each other on a different level, which really helps us get better, but also, in practice, we compete at a different level and we can really get after each other, talk trash, whatever,"" Schofield says. ""I think that's a big step for us. My first two years, we weren't able to do that. We had a bunch of individuals.""
As the Volunteers team gathers in the film room to plot against the Razorbacks and projected first-round pick Daniel Gafford, a concerned staffer cautions a visitor.
""Um, I wouldn't sit there if I were you,"" he says. ""That's Admiral's seat.""
Once the veteran leader settles into his aisle seat in the third row, Barnes introduces a special guest: Lawrence Frank, the current LA Clippers president and a former Tennessee assistant. He's not here as an NBA executive but as someone with a connection to the program.
Frank's presentation is what you might expect if Samuel L. Jackson did an unfiltered TED talk.
""Listen, you shouldn't give a s--- about the NBA,"" Frank says.
Frank is here to talk about teams: what makes them work and what makes them fail.
""It's the division within,"" he says before listing the issues that could ruin a team's aspirations.
When he's done, the players applaud Frank, watch some film on Arkansas, grab a meal and stuff a few protein bars from the pantry into their pockets on their way out. The Vols look like a group of factory workers clocking out at 5 p.m.
You can't tell if this is a team on the verge of earning the No. 1 ranking or a squad fighting for its season, because its collective personality never wavers.
It's Barnes' balanced demeanor -- he never seems to take himself too seriously -- that keeps the Vols loose.
Tennessee opened a new team lounge in September, and the feature most associated with its head coach is an old-school arcade cabinet.
""I love Golden Tee [Golf]. That's mine,"" Barnes says of the game in which he enthusiastically and frequently challenges his players.
He makes a group of staffers laugh when he talks about a former trainer who used ""horse medicine"" to treat a player's sprained ankle when he was at Providence in the 1990s. ""We had a guy at Providence who did things a little different,"" Barnes says. ""One day, this player came out smelling like garlic.""
Barnes is always the life of the party, but if you think this guy isn't serious about his craft, maybe take a peek at that résumé one more time. He has 680 wins, and has won 20 games at five different schools in a head-coaching career that started at George Mason in 1987. It should be noted that none of those schools (George Mason, Providence, Clemson, Texas and Tennessee) can be accurately described as a college basketball blue blood.
The turning point in Tennessee's development into a consistent winner, according to a question posed to Vols assistant Rob Lanier, is obvious.
""When Dave Hart called Rick Barnes,"" Lanier answers. ""Because when Clemson hired him, that's what they were getting. When Providence hired him, that's what they were getting. When Texas hired him, that's what they were getting. When Dave Hart made the decision that he would be opportunistic at that particular time under those particular set of circumstances, he gave Tennessee an opportunity to do something with their basketball program by calling Rick Barnes. That was the biggest turning point.""
Barnes has finally reached the parking lot at Stock & Barrel, one of his go-to places for lunch. As he walks into the restaurant, you can hear the chatter.
Minutes after he sits down, a waitress approaches him. ""I just want to say thank you for turning this from a football school into a basketball school,"" she says.
The chef leaves the kitchen to bring Barnes his black bean and corn salad. ""Uh, just wanted to, uh, bring this to you,"" he says. ""Appreciate you, Coach.""
Barnes takes a few bites before the manager walks toward him. ""We were all watching the game on Saturday,"" he says. ""We were just in here screaming.""
When he returns to Thompson-Boling Arena, Barnes notices that his parking space near the entrance is occupied.
""You know what, I never do this,"" he says before creating his own spot next to the curb. Practice will begin soon -- just 24 hours before Tennessee's lopsided, 106-87 win over Arkansas.
As players enter, Barnes looks around the empty arena.
He then starts to climb the stairs in the massive facility. It's a concrete slab of steps, dozens of them, that never seems to end.
""Whew, my quads,"" Barnes says as he moves toward the nosebleeds.
More steps, more pain.
""You gotta see this,"" he says.
As he reaches the last row in Section 322, one of the highest points in the arena, he finally sits down.
He waves to Tom Satkowiak, the team's sports information director who recently had a liver transplant.
""Tom! Up here!"" Barnes says. ""Can you guys hear me?""
It's a breathtaking scene -- nearly 12 stories above the court -- and it's one Barnes is digesting.
The chatty veteran coach, who has a story for every chapter in his life, is quiet. He's just staring ahead, not saying a word.
Then he smiles.
Three years ago, Barnes lost a job he'd enjoyed for nearly 20 years. But he found a school that wanted a coach who would love this team as much as its supporters do. It was a perfect match and a lesson that sometimes an unpleasant ending is nothing more than a necessary beginning.
""Well, grab the railing on your way down,"" Barnes says as he trots back down the steep steps.
He's not one to get stuck in the moment. The hike to the top of Thompson-Boling was nice, but Rick Barnes has a job to do.
"
25804871,"DURHAM, N.C. -- Zion Williamson delivered the highlight because this was Duke's biggest game of the season, and it wouldn't have felt right without the freshman doing something jaw-droppingly incredible. And so he pulled down a rebound, dribbled coast to coast, weaved his way through four Virginia defenders, and, while Virginia's Jay Huff slashed his arm, hammered home a monster dunk.
It's what we've come to expect: the flash, the power, the hysteria that follows.
What Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski saw, however, was the setup; that moment when Williamson, all 280 pounds of seemingly uncontrolled momentum, barreled his way through the nation's toughest defense.
""As amazing as that finish was,"" Krzyzewski said, ""how he maneuvered -- I thought for sure he was going to lose the ball. Then, boom.""
Boom. We remember the boom. But the rest of the country ought to be worried about how that fuse was lit.
Krzyzewski pointed out afterward that Williamson had been a point guard up until eighth grade, which must've been a nightmare for those other 13-year-olds. It wasn't much better for the No. 4 Cavaliers on Saturday in the Blue Devils' 72-70 victory.
RJ Barrett ran the point a bit more recently, but he was still out of position Saturday, thrust into the role because of Tre Jones' absence. If there'd been a knock on Barrett, the nation's top recruit entering the season, it's that he'd been a shoot-first player on the offensive end, and his woeful 0-for-10 stretch and 4-of-17 performance from 3 in Monday's loss to Syracuse only underscored the critique.
But here was Barrett against Virginia's smothering defense, moving the ball, setting up weaves that top-ranked Duke hadn't run all season, penetrating again and again rather than settling for the perimeter jumpers. Barrett played his best offensive game of the season when the Blue Devils (15-2, 4-1 ACC) needed it the most -- without their point guard, against an undefeated team -- and he finished with 30 points and just one turnover.
When it was over, Williamson and Barrett met at the top of the key near Virginia's basket. They hugged, tight and forceful, then slapped hands. The weight of the performance -- 79 minutes between them, 57 of the Blue Devils' 72 points, all but one of Duke's made baskets in the second half -- was obvious. But it was the raw emotion that stood out. That embrace isn't what's sold when we talk about this one-and-done superclass at Duke. These weren't two stars on a brief stopover before cashing an NBA check. This meant something, meant so much that both Barrett and Williamson found new depth to their games in order for Duke to come away with a win.
After knocking Virginia from the ranks of the undefeated Saturday night, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said it was decided a day earlier that injured point guard Tre Jones wasn't healthy enough to face the Cavaliers.
This is to take nothing from Virginia, of course. Afterward, Krzyzewski favorably compared Kyle Guy to JJ Redick, and the Cavaliers (16-1, 4-1) pushed Duke to the brink throughout the second half, with 15 lead changes and seven ties in the game. So much of the Blue Devils' performance was a smoke-and-mirrors diversion, something Krzyzewski noted was probably a less-than-ideal approach that just so happened to be the best option they had without Jones on the court. But the point was, when Duke needed something more -- minutes without depth, scoring without a distributor, defense without their best on-ball defender -- Barrett and Williamson delivered.
To suggest the Duke duo is as talented as any in the country is hardly breaking new ground. The Zion Show is arguably the biggest thing to hit college basketball in years, and Barrett's fluid game and smooth shot offer a constant reminder of what he can one day become in the NBA.
There will be time for all that praise, but Saturday, those immense futures gave way to the immediacy of the moment, when Barrett and Williamson simply wanted to beat the best team Duke has played this season, and to do it in the name of their injured teammate. None of that was about the highlights. It was about finding a way -- any way -- to get the job done. Turns out, that's a good way to build something bigger than a couple superstars.
""I feel like I can be a great perimeter player, but I don't get to showcase it,"" Williamson said. ""And Coach K, he'll come in the locker room and look me in the eye and say, 'I believe in your ability.' When the greatest coach of all time tells you that, it gives you confidence.""
So good. The guy who's owned highlight shows for three months is feeling more confident. That fits nicely alongside the smooth shooter who proved himself in the paint, and the undermanned team that found it still has plenty in the tank, even without one of its best.
This doesn't guarantee a thing for Duke in the long run, just as a Virginia victory wouldn't have erased the demons of UMBC. Those stories will be told in March. But Krzyzewski has said all season that there is room for growth, that these are still just freshmen, that there are depths yet to be explored. And Saturday sure felt like the Hall of Fame coach mined something special from two guys who were already pretty great.

25870070,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- Tennessee handled its first week at No. 1 in more than a decade well enough to stay on its AP Top 25 perch.
The Volunteers earned 48 of 64 first-place votes in Monday's poll to extend the program's first stint at No. 1 since February 2008. Tennessee (18-1, 6-0 Southeastern Conference) has won 14 straight games -- the program's longest winning streak since the 1922-23 season and one shy of the school record -- since suffering a neutral-court loss to Kansas in November.
""To be quite honest with you, I talked to them about [how] it's new to them,'' Volunteers coach Rick Barnes said of the No. 1 ranking after Saturday's victory against West Virginia. ""They've earned it, but they can't forget what got them where they are.
""Is there more noise around them? Obviously, it is. But they've got to be mature enough to deal with that.''
First-place votes in parentheses
The top six teams in the poll remained unchanged, with Duke sitting at No. 2, followed by Virginia, Gonzaga, Michigan and Michigan State. The Spartans stayed put despite suffering their first Big Ten loss, at Purdue, in a game that helped lift the Boilermakers back into the poll.
KENTUCKY'S RISE 
John Calipari's latest group of Kentucky youngsters keeps winning, and climbing in the poll.
The Wildcats (16-3, 5-1 SEC) moved past Nevada to reach No. 7 after Saturday's home win against Kansas extended their streak to six games. Kentucky was ranked No. 2 in the preseason poll before a blowout loss to Duke in the season opener dropped the Wildcats to No. 10, then they slid even further, to No. 19, by mid-December.
But Kentucky has been rising ever since, and its only two losses since the Duke game have come by a combined three points.
THE TOP 10
Nevada slid a spot to No. 8, while North Carolina and Marquette each rose two spots to round out the top 10.
RISING
No. 15 Louisville (15-5) has been playing well for the past two weeks under first-year coach Chris Mack. Now the Cardinals, who cracked the poll for the first time last week, have moved up eight spots for the week's biggest jump after reaching 6-1 in the Atlantic Coast Conference during a week that included a win against now-No. 23 North Carolina State.
No. 19 LSU rose six spots, while No. 13 Houston, No. 14 Villanova and No. 20 Iowa State each jumped four spots.
SLIDING
Maryland (16-5) took a big fall after losses at Michigan State and then to Illinois in New York. The Terrapins fell eight spots to No. 21 for the week's biggest slide among ranked teams.
No. 18 Buffalo fell four spots for the other significant slide.
ESPN's BPI enthusiasts pick 12 teams in an entirely mythical NCAA tournament draft. There will be twists.
HELLO AGAIN
No. 17 Purdue, No. 24 Wisconsin and No. 25 Florida State returned to the poll after being ranked for multiple weeks earlier this season.
Purdue was ranked in the first four polls and peaked at No. 19. Wisconsin was ranked in seven polls in November and December, reaching No. 12.
As for Florida State, the Seminoles had been ranked in every poll this season, peaking at No. 9 in December and standing at No. 11 two weeks ago, before falling out last week following a third straight ACC loss.
FALLING OUT
Auburn (No. 16), Iowa (No. 19) and Mississippi (No. 20) fell out of the poll. The Tigers had spent six weeks in the top 10 earlier this season.
CONFERENCE WATCH
The ACC led the nation with seven teams in the poll, three of them in the top 10. The Big Ten was second with five ranked teams, followed by the SEC's four and the Big 12's three.

25869944,"It's the first question most recruits and transfers ask the Nevada Wolf Pack coach when they arrive on campus.
Duke was pummeled without Zion Williamson (knee sprain) for most of its game against North Carolina.
Duke won ugly Saturday, making just 2 of 21 3-point attempts. Can the Blue Devils win a title despite long-range struggles?
The absence of undefeated teams doesn't mean there are no great ones. Plus, some more college hoops hot takes I can prove.
How far are we from Vegas?
""I thought it was Vegas,"" Wolf Pack senior Caleb Martin said of his initial exposure to the existence of Reno. ""Everybody thought it was Vegas.""
""I didn't even know it existed,"" Caleb's twin brother, Cody Martin, added. ""I was the typical East Coast guy who thought Reno was Vegas and thought that it was going to be sunny and hot all the time. And then we got here, I was like, 'Y'all aren't in Vegas?' I had no idea where I was going to.""
Sin City, Reno isn't. Farther west than Los Angeles (yep, check a map), Reno is closer to Sacramento and San Francisco than Las Vegas. It's more Lake Tahoe and the Sierra Nevada mountains than glitz and the Strip. That's part of why the job that Musselman has done with the Wolf Pack since he took over four years ago is so impressive.
By the way, the answer is seven hours.
""It's the worst drive in the world,"" Musselman said.
During Musselman's freshman season at University of San Diego in 1983-84, the Toreros reached the NCAA tournament behind senior star Mike Whitmarsh and 7-foot freshman Scott Thompson. They went up against Princeton in the play-in round at The Palestra in Philadelphia, and it wasn't all that close. Pete Carril's Princeton offense of half-court sets and backdoor cuts -- and 38 points from Kevin ""Moon"" Mullin -- carved up San Diego, and the game was out of reach in the final minutes.
San Diego coach Jim Brovelli cleared the bench, sending in Musselman, seniors Randy Brickley and Bill Penfold and a couple of other reserves.
But Brickley didn't want to go in. His playing time had disappeared in his final year, and he was stung by the notion of mop-up duty.
""I wasn't going to go in,"" Brickley recalled last week. ""I had had it.""
Then Musselman got in his ear.
""He said, 'Dude, you can't do that. You gotta go in.' I'm pretty sure the words, 'Regret it for the rest of your life,' came up,"" Brickley said. ""So, I got up and went in.""
Brickley, Penfold and Musselman all played a few possessions that game, and they appear in an NCAA tournament box score. Brickley attempted a shot, an air ball from the baseline -- ""I maintain it was an assist"" -- but he likely would have sat out if not for Musselman's urging him to go into the game.
""It would have been pretty stupid,"" Brickley said. ""I'm thankful that Eric did that.""
Musselman laughs when recounting the story and jokes about his role on that first San Diego team. He was roommates with Thompson and two other freshmen, so he received spot minutes just to keep his more talented classmates happy. His primary job during his first season was to make sure Thompson woke up and went to class on time.
""I looked at myself as a coach even as a freshman,"" Musselman said.
Musselman's path to coaching goes back further than that, as he is the son of former NBA, CBA and college coach Bill Musselman. He remembers going to Williams Arena after school when his father coached at the University of Minnesota, dribbling a basketball during practice and watching film with his father afterward. He remembers being back in California, lying on one bunk bed in his bedroom with his father on the other, listening to Chick Hearn announce Los Angeles Lakers games at night.
He remembers his father quizzing him on box scores from the previous night's games every morning before school.
""He was my best friend. He was my idol,"" Musselman said. ""I wanted to do what he did.""
Musselman was drafted by the Albany Patroons of the CBA out of college. Instead, he spent two seasons with the CBA's Rapid City Thrillers, first as the general manager and then as the head coach. He spent one season working under his father as an assistant coach with the Minnesota Timberwolves before returning to the CBA with the Rapid City Thrillers (later renamed the Florida Beach Dogs). During his time in the CBA, Musselman coached in South Dakota or Florida for eight months out of the year, then went back to San Diego for four months to relax on the beach.
It wasn't a bad life, but Musselman wanted more. He was getting bored.
He approached his father about coaching in the USBL during the summers between the CBA seasons. His dad initially pushed back, telling Musselman he should just relax in his time off.
""I want to coach,"" Musselman responded, saying it was additional time to get better as a coach -- and he could get to know players in the USBL and recruit them for his CBA team.
So his father spoke with his dentist, his stockbroker and a third investor who was involved with computer technologies, and the four of them purchased a USBL team in Sarasota, Florida, where Musselman's dad lived at the time.
""They literally bought a USBL franchise,"" Musselman said. ""We ended up breaking every attendance record. ... It was awesome for me. Because I experimented. I tried all these different things, wacky things -- triple pick-and-rolls -- just stuff that no one did.""
Musselman eventually made the move back to the NBA as an assistant with the Orlando Magic and then the Atlanta Hawks.
His big break came in 2002, two years after his father died at age 59 of heart and kidney failure related to liver disease, when Musselman was hired as the coach of the Golden State Warriors.
""I was sitting there alone. The press conference was in 20 minutes. They said, 'You can sit in your office, gather your thoughts,'"" Musselman recalled. ""I closed the door, and I started bawling. I was thinking about what my dad would think of me as a head coach. And at that time, we were the first father-son coaches in the history of the NBA. I was just thinking about, I can't believe my dad was a head coach, and since I was in junior high, I've been hoping that this dream would come true, and now it is, and he's not even here to see it.""
Musselman led the Warriors to a 17-game improvement and finished second in the coach of the year voting to Gregg Popovich. Perhaps most notably, Musselman's team finished second in the NBA in scoring offense in his first season at the helm.
""At such a young age, just constantly climbing the ladder and doing it really quickly,"" Musselman said. ""The top of it was the Warriors.""
Musselman won his 100th game at Nevada on Jan. 23 against Colorado State. That made him the 27th-fastest coach in Division I history to reach that milestone -- and the first one to get there among coaches hired in the spring of 2015.
""I'm really old to get to 100,"" the 54-year-old Musselman said after the victory. ""It's 100 in college. I've won a lot more than that, just in a bunch of different leagues that you guys have never heard of, with a bunch of different letters.""
A decade ago, Musselman was at the lowest point of his coaching career. After being fired following a tumultuous second season in Golden State -- during which he reportedly clashed with players and management -- he was let go after one season coaching the Sacramento Kings, a tenure that started with a drunken driving charge during the preseason.
Musselman was out of the business for a couple of years. He turned down an opportunity to coach in St. Petersburg, Russia, and returned to California with his now-wife, Danyelle, a former sports broadcaster. They got married in 2009 and welcomed a daughter in 2010. But in Musselman's third year out of a job, with most of his time being spent with his family, including his two sons from his first marriage, he realized he missed being a coach.
He wanted to return to the NBA as a head coach but wasn't getting any calls or interviews, so he spent two seasons in the D-League with the Reno Bighorns and Los Angeles D-Fenders, winning the regular-season championship with both teams and having a number of players called up to the NBA. But he still wasn't getting much buzz for an NBA head-coaching job, and he didn't want to become an NBA assistant coach. So he turned to college, serving as an assistant under Herb Sendek at Arizona State for two seasons.
Then Flip Saunders called offering a job. Saunders, then the head coach of the Timberwolves, knew Musselman's father and knew Musselman had a relationship with Thrillers-turned-Wolves Sam Mitchell and Sidney Lowe. A short time later, LSU assistant coach David Patrick called. Patrick told Musselman the Tigers were going to land Ben Simmons and that head coach Johnny Jones wanted an NBA guy on staff.
Musselman had a decision to make.
""This was like the defining college moment,"" Musselman said.
Musselman was leaning toward Minnesota and the NBA, closer to his comfort zone. He knew Saunders well.
His wife said no.
""We spent two years at Arizona State, and no. We're going to Baton Rouge. I don't care how comfortable you are. This is the best thing to do,"" Musselman recalled her saying. ""She was supportive, but she was like, 'Let's go to Baton Rouge and see where it takes us.'""
One year later, it took them to Reno.
Musselman's NBA fingerprints are all over this Nevada team, immediately noticeable in his constant NBA references during practice, from Gilbert Arenas' motivational tactics to the Houston Rockets' style of cutting to the basket.
It also was his NBA experience that helped shape how Musselman planned to rebuild Nevada when he arrived in the spring of 2015. The Wolf Pack were coming off a 9-22 campaign and hadn't been to the NCAA tournament since 2007.
Musselman tried to act like a general manager, treating his 13 scholarships like NBA roster spots. In other words, he did not use a scholarship just to get a body on the roster. Instead of playing older players, he went the NBA route of using younger players more to build for the future.
""I think the plan was, how can we be as good as we can, as quick as we can, with sustainability?"" he said. ""Having our fourth year be our best year. That was our plan from day one.""
Within weeks of getting the job, Musselman hit the transfer market with Marcus Marshall (Missouri State) and Jordan Caroline (Southern Illinois) and landed one-time Arizona State commit Lindsey Drew. Musselman hadn't coached a game in Reno yet, but the momentum was shifting.
""When I came here, we were coming off a 9-22 season, so everybody's like, 'Why the hell are you going there?'"" Caroline said. ""I just believed in Muss' vision. I want to be a part of something special, in turning something around.""
In Musselman's first year at the helm, Nevada had a 15-win improvement and won the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) championship. He went back to the transfer market, landing Kendall Stephens (Purdue) and Hallice Cooke (Iowa State), as well as Caleb and Cody Martin from NC State.
""There was a lot of teams -- you could tell they wanted [Caleb] more than me, and they didn't do their research,"" Cody Martin said. ""Here, it was different. You could tell [Musselman] did his research, and he knew my game inside and out and knew how I was going to be able to impact the team. ... It was eye-opening.""
A Mountain West Conference title and an NCAA tournament appearance followed, as did a first-round loss to Iowa State. Last season brought more improvement, another Mountain West championship, another NCAA tournament -- and this time, a run to the Sweet 16 that included comeback wins over Texas and Cincinnati.
Musselman's approach helped establish Nevada as one of the go-to transfer destinations nationally. The Wolf Pack welcomed multiple transfers in each of the past four offseasons and just added midseason transfer Shamiel Stevenson (Pittsburgh) and Mike Lewis II (Duquesne), both of whom committed to Musselman and his staff without a visit to Reno.
""He brings in the right type of transfers,"" Caleb Martin said. ""He brings in guys who have a chip on their shoulder. And he's got a chip on his shoulder too. He's been through his own type of adversity in his coaching career. He wants to prove people wrong, and he brings in kids who want to prove people wrong too.""
Caroline offered his take.
""It's kind of like an all-star team in a sense,"" Caroline said.
Musselman isn't just concerned with the makeup of his team. He is obsessed with every aspect of his program. During practice, he can be seen taking notes on social media strategies. He constantly asks for details on ticket sales. His wife helped organize a ""Pink Out Game"" to raise money to fight cancer, bringing in $22,800 in one minute during the Colorado State game. Musselman and his staff wear polo shirts instead of suits, not just because it's more comfortable but also because he thinks Adidas might get more bang for its buck if it sees its logo every game.
Every season, Musselman changes the passcode on the locker room door, so the players are reminded every day of their goal. The first year they arrived, it was ""2020"" for winning 20 games. The second year, it was the date of Selection Sunday. Last season, it was ""1616"" for reaching the Sweet 16. Earlier this campaign, it was the score of an early-season game.
""If you talk about something every day, it comes true,"" Musselman said. ""So, we've always tried to pick something.""
There isn't a detail that goes overlooked.
That mindset was supposed to culminate this season, the one Musselman and his staff had circled since they arrived in Reno. It was all supposed to come together in 2018-19. The three stars -- Caroline and the Martins -- were seniors. The team added much-needed size in the offseason with Old Dominion transfer Trey Porter and beat Pac-12 programs for McDonald's All-American Jordan Brown.
For a stretch last spring, it looked like it might fall apart. Caleb and Cody Martin were seriously looking at the NBA draft, and they took it down to the final day before calling Musselman and announcing via speakerphone to a room full of Nevada supporters.
Guess who's back #martwinning pic.twitter.com/PmKR60FSCx
""I was really close. Me and Cody went up to the last hour,"" Caleb Martin said. ""It was tough, man. It was hard to leave this. We were coming back to a top-10 team. ... Seeing all the people, everything's gonna be sold out, how much love and appreciation from Reno and the city. ... Try to do something special one more time. Leave my mark on this place. At the end of the day, I do want to leave my footprint here before I leave.""
The Martins have left more than their footprints. Nevada is 19-1 so far this season, with the lone loss coming at New Mexico in early January. Every home game for the rest of the season already is sold out, and the Wolf Pack are up to No. 8 in the AP poll. They have legitimate Final Four hopes.
""Everybody's behind us,"" Cody Martin said. ""It's allowed me to be in a position I never thought I'd be in, not only with my basketball skills but things out in the community. Everything that Coach said he was going to do, he's done since day one, and that's why everything I try to do is right by him because I know he does the same for me.""
It's about an hour before Nevada is set to take the floor against Colorado State for the Pink Out Game -- and Musselman's 100th Wolf Pack win -- and there's no sign of angst among the Nevada coaching staff. There's no last-minute planning. A game between the Philadelphia 76ers and San Antonio Spurs is on TV, so they discuss Gregg Popovich's resistance to Brett Brown's ""GOAT"" endorsement. That turns into a greatest-of-all-time debate.
A few old friends, from coaching and outside coaching, stop by to wish Musselman luck. His athletic director pops in. Musselman notices an inbounds play from the Tennessee-Vanderbilt game and tells one of his staff members to diagram it.
Musselman will give a pregame speech to his team using a bowl of popcorn, a paint can and nails as props ... and then bring the popcorn back into the coaches' room to eat it while watching a Missouri Valley Conference game between Missouri State and Loyola Chicago. Reminiscing and what-might-have-been notions ensue, since Nevada lost to Loyola Chicago in last year's Sweet 16.
Lest one thinks he is unfocused, Musselman is constantly asking for updates on a number of things: What are the sit-out transfers doing in pregame? How's the student section? Is everyone wearing pink? Do the guys have enough bounce in warm-ups?
It is Musselman's obsession with the details of the program that has endeared him to the fan base and has Nevada making program history every week.
""He came here to win,"" Cody Martin said. ""He came here to give the fans what they want to see. He came here to have a winning program. He came here to compete, and that's what he does, day in and day out.""
Caleb Martin agreed:
""Everybody knows Nevada now.""

25825177,"Welcome to Volume I of the Bilas Index, the most reliable measure of basketball excellence on this tiny, little planet. Since the first ball was dribbled in practice this season, data has been input into the ginormous hunkin' brain inside of The Bilastrator's massive cranium. The Bilas Index has farsightedness, trustworthiness and uncanny accuracy that are mind-boggling. It is a constant. It is a national treasure. And it is the only measure the Selection Committee should use.
We asked our coaches to tell us about the technical fouls they remember best. Guess which coach got his 14 seconds into his first game?
Duke won, Virginia and Michigan lost, Tennessee won but wasn't impressive. Here's what's real and what's fake after a confusing college hoops weekend.
Duke was pummeled without Zion Williamson (knee sprain) for most of its game against North Carolina.
The Bilas Index is not a ranking or poll voted upon at the whim of the uninformed. It is an ordered listing of the best teams in college basketball. It is not a ""snapshot"" or the flavor of the week. It is based upon actual data and the vast reservoir of hoops knowledge of The Bilastrator. The Bilas Index does not rely upon any one metric, such as the NET or RPI. The Bilas Index inputs every reliable piece of basketball data and sorts it all for you in an easily digestible package. It cannot be gamed because The Bilastrator's gigantic brain is the most reliable tool for judging, evaluating and separating teams and players. Imagine the brains of Hawking, Galileo, Einstein and Edison having been applied only to basketball, and then multiply that by 10 -- you'd have The Bilastrator's brain. Subtract from that the distraction of sitting next to Seth Greenberg and Jay Williams every Saturday, and you still have the most powerful basketball evaluation tool ever invented.
It must be pointed out annually that even though The Bilas Index is available to the Selection Committee, it cannot keep that group of well-intentioned people from making a mess of selections and seeding. Nothing, including Zion Williamson in midair, is that imposing. That said, enjoy The Bilas Index. As always, you're welcome.
1. Virginia Cavaliers
Remember, the Bilas Index is not a poll that bends to the prevailing wind of each result. If Tiger Woods in his prime hit a tee shot out of bounds, that wouldn't make him less than the best golfer. Similarly, a road loss at Duke hardly disqualifies Virginia as the No. 1 team. Everybody has lost and will lose again. That's basketball. Virginia has better offensive weaponry than it had with last season's overall No. 1 seed. Kyle Guy and Ty Jerome make up one of the best backcourts in the country, and De'Andre Hunter is a legit lottery pick. Virginia isn't going anywhere.
2. Duke Blue Devils
The thing that gets lost in Zion-mania is the value of Tre Jones. This kid is a ""next-level"" defender. Watch film of him. He is a savant on and off the ball. He is also a very good finisher. With Jones, Duke is as formidable a defensive team as there is in America. Free throw shooting and perimeter shooting could be issues down the stretch; Duke needs to improve in both areas. But Zion and RJ Barrett are good enough to carry the offense. Wow.
3. Tennessee Volunteers
The Vols are legit and have two SEC Player of the Year candidates in Grant Williams and Admiral Schofield. Williams is nearly unstoppable in the middle of the floor, and he brings it every game. But Tennessee is not going to overwhelm teams with talent alone. When the Vols guard people ""five as one,"" Tennessee can beat anyone. When the Vols are casual on the defensive end, any good team can give them a tussle. Grit is this team's calling card.
4. Michigan State Spartans
Don't be surprised if Tom Izzo's team cuts down the nets in Minneapolis this year. The Spartans have experience, toughness and the best overall offensive point guard among Power 5 teams in Cassius Winston (sorry, Cassius, you play in the age of Ja Morant of Murray State). The Spartans have won 20 straight Big Ten games, a streak that just doesn't happen in today's game.
5. Michigan Wolverines
The Wolverines' poor performance at Wisconsin was an aberration. Michigan might not have a juggernaut on the offensive end, but it has a great defensive team. The lack of a go-to scorer is a concern, but there are precious few teams that will feel comfortable playing Michigan on a neutral floor. Ignas Brazdeikis will continue to improve as a lead performer, and he will not have another bagel. It was a great win by Wisconsin, but not one I would expect to come often at Michigan's expense.
6. Gonzaga Bulldogs
With Killian Tillie back and getting into game shape again, the Zags add an NBA first-rounder to the rotation. Tillie is the Zags' best shooter and shot-blocker, and he provides another dimension to an already terrific team. Is this Zags team better than its 2015-16 version? No. But this team is good enough to beat anyone. Sadly, we won't really get to see that until March.
7. Kentucky Wildcats
Give John Calipari credit. This dude does not surrender to the excuses of youth, and he just keeps coaching up the young guys. And they respond. Like last season with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, freshman point guard Ashton Hagans has broken out to become a team-changing star. We often refer to a player breaking out due to offensive performance. Yet Hagans broke out with his defense, his harassing pressure on the ball, his steals and his resulting offensive improvement. Plus, Tyler Herro has blossomed into a reliable scorer and defender. The next step is for Nick Richards to play more minutes. His rim protection is the one thing Kentucky lacks.
8. North Carolina Tar Heels
The Heels are a bit of a puzzle, and the missing piece is defense. When North Carolina plays defense with intensity, passion and pride, this team is really good. When the Heels play to just ""outscore"" or ""out-offense"" an opponent, they are just OK. And to Roy Williams, OK is not OK. Carolina is not big inside and has nobody to throw it to for an easy post score, but Nassir Little is starting to get comfortable out on the floor. He is a difference-maker.
9. Buffalo Bulls
This team is legit. With top scorer and shooter CJ Massinburg, lefty wing Jeremy Harris and super-sub Nick Perkins, the Bulls can beat anyone. Until they tripped at Northern Illinois on Tuesday, the only loss for Buffalo was at Marquette, when Markus Howard turned into a video game. The Bulls might not lose again until the postseason. If there is a non-Power 5 team (other than Gonzaga) that can reach the Final Four, look no further than Buffalo.
10. Nevada Wolf Pack
The Wolf Pack started 18-1, with the only stumble coming at New Mexico in a bizarre blowout. Jordan Caroline has been the consistent horse, and he is a double-double machine. The areas of concern are rebounding and consistent shooting from the perimeter. Caleb Martin is a good shooter who has not shot the ball well, and Jazz Johnson is a microwave shooter, but will Nevada have enough over three weeks in March?
11. Kansas Jayhawks
If Kansas wins the Big 12 yet again, this will be Bill Self's most improbable title. Kansas has every reason to give up the title to the field this season because the Jayhawks are smaller inside without Udoka Azubuike and Silvio De Sousa and because the Jayhawks' guards are so darn young. Yet Dedric Lawson has been so consistently productive and the ""good Lagerald Vick"" has shown up so often that Kansas has been able to overcome its deficiencies. Buckle up, KU fans. There will be a lot of close games this season, but it will be fun.
12. Marquette Golden Eagles
Markus Howard is simply ridiculous. Sam Hauser is a pro and will play in the NBA for a long, long time. Marquette has fiber and fights down to the last minute. There is not a more fun team to watch in all of college hoops than Wojo's Warriors. They will shoot from anywhere and make it, and they don't give up.
13. Texas Tech Red Raiders
The Red Raiders are listed this high due to amazingly tight and tough defense. Texas Tech defends as well as any team in the country, but the Red Raiders simply cannot score efficiently. Jarrett Culver is a great player who will be a first-round pick, but what other Red Raiders player can score at the end of a clock? This is not a top-50 offensive team, and most of the analytics suggest that this is not a top-100 offensive team. Defense will get Texas Tech to the second weekend of the NCAA tournament. You have to score to get beyond that.
14. Auburn Tigers
The Tigers have great guards in Jared Harper and Bryce Brown, but without Austin Wiley in the lineup, Auburn did not have enough inside or on the glass to beat Kentucky at home Saturday. Auburn can force turnovers and be disruptive, but the Tigers need to rebound the ball better at the defensive end.
15. Houston Cougars
Kelvin Sampson isn't a good coach. He is a great coach. It is amazing what he has done with a Houston program that was more of an archaeological dig than a good hoops job. Houston defends well and has a great guard in Corey Davis Jr. who can shoot it from anywhere and (almost) never misses a free throw. The Cougars are not 1983 vintage, but they are damn good.
16. Maryland Terrapins
The Terps are back. Anthony Cowan Jr. is one of the best guards in the country, yet he is still under the radar. He has elite quickness and has been incredibly efficient and selfless with a young group. The key for Maryland has been Bruno Fernando, who has emerged as a star. Fernando commands a double team with his near 70 percent shooting from the floor, yet he is a good passer out of that situation. As the young guys get more comfortable and consistent, Maryland should get better. The Big Ten will present a challenge to the freshmen's confidence.
17. Villanova Wildcats
The Wildcats have adapted to a new style. They cannot play offensively the same way they did the past few years. There are more isolations and ""backdowns"" to get the ball into the right hands, but Phil Booth has been excellent. What a selfless player and winner. Villanova got caught short with Donte DiVincenzo and Omari Spellman going pro early, but this ""bridge year"" will be important for the future. Villanova still has the best culture in college basketball.
18. Virginia Tech Hokies
This is a fantastic offensive team, and it is a pleasure to watch the Hokies move the ball and shoot it. The only things standing in the way of Virginia Tech contending for the ACC title and a Final Four are defense and rim protection. The Hokies can be a good defensive team and have improved, but opposing teams can get the ball into the paint too easily, and Kerry Blackshear Jr. (who had 19 points and 17 rebounds at North Carolina) cannot protect the paint and the rim all by himself. But remember, Loyola-Chicago reached the Final Four by shooting the stuffing out of the ball. Virginia Tech can also do that.
19. Iowa State Cyclones
The Cyclones are now healthy and have a full complement of players. Marial Shayok is now a conference-leading scorer after being a role player at Virginia (which should give you an indication of how good Virginia is and has been), and five players on the roster can hit multiple 3s in any given game. Iowa State does not have a ton of size, but Talen Horton-Tucker provides a wonderful matchup problem for any opponent. Give this team another month, and the Cyclones will be the best team in the Big 12 not named Kansas.
20. Kansas State Wildcats
Without Dean Wade, Kansas State was average. With Dean Wade, Kansas State is very good. Wade is an NBA player, and he provides a go-to scorer and passer alongside Barry Brown Jr. The Wildcats are a rough, tough defensive team, but with Wade, Kansas State can be a respectable offensive team as well. Without Wade? Not so much.
21. Louisville Cardinals
Chris Mack has brought a new system, new identity and new feel into The Ville, and the team and community are responding. The Bilastrator thinks it is the hair, but reasonable minds might disagree on that. Jordan Nwora is one of the best players in the ACC, and Steven Enoch is an NBA-caliber athlete with a terrific shooting touch. The keys have been togetherness and Christen Cunningham, one of the prime examples of why transfers should not be discouraged. Cunningham was a grad transfer from Samford, where he would have played in obscurity. Yet he transferred to Louisville and is respected nationally for his game and his character. Can only coaches aspire to move?
22. Nebraska Cornhuskers
Tim Miles has done a great job in Lincoln, and the Nebraska brass has stuck with him rather than stay on the ""fire the coach, don't give adequate time, fire the next coach"" carousel. Miles has veteran guards in James Palmer Jr. and Glynn Watson Jr., along with outstanding wings in Isaac Copeland Jr. (the Georgetown transfer) and Isaiah Roby. If Nebraska can rebound the ball better, this is a potential second-weekend team.
23. TCU Horned Frogs
On the list of ""Coaches Who Have Done A Great Job,"" the name Jamie Dixon would be near the top. Think of the difference Dixon, Rick Barnes, Kermit Davis, Ben Howland, Kevin Keatts and Chris Mack, to name a few, have made at their current programs. TCU lost a good guard in Jaylen Fisher but has a really good guard in Alex Robinson, one of the best passers in the country. Keep an eye on Kevin Samuel. He is an elite prospect as a big man in the Big 12. When he starts knocking down free throws, look out. He already shoots better than 70 percent from the floor.
24. Iowa Hawkeyes
Winner of 10 of 11 games heading into the Thursday battle at home with Michigan State, Iowa has been a very good offensive team and has been coming along on the defensive end. The Hawkeyes do a great job of balancing the offense and getting to the foul line.
25. Purdue Boilermakers
The analytics will tell you that Purdue is a top-10 team, but the Bilas Index factors in the inconsistency and defensive issues to put the Boilermakers at a solid top-25 slot. Carsen Edwards' brilliance gives Purdue the ability to beat almost anyone on a given night, but Purdue is not quite there. In Mackey, Purdue packs a much better punch.
26. Syracuse Orange
If Syracuse makes shots, the Orange are very good. If Syracuse is clanking rims ... yikes. Tyus Battle, Frank Howard and Oshae Brissett seemed to find something in the Big Monday game at Duke, and Cuse followed that with a solid win against Pittsburgh. The Orange should continue to get better, but they need consistent production from Howard to win in the ACC.
27. LSU Tigers
The Tigers have talent. Tremont Waters, Naz Reid and Skylar Mays are all very good, and LSU has size and athleticism. If LSU can cut down on turnovers and mental errors (while trying to do good things), this team can take off. The schedule favors LSU to have a nice run into mid-February.
28. NC State Wolfpack
Kevin Keatts has done a masterful job in building the NC State program. With Markell Johnson out of the lineup for a few games, the Pack were a little shaky, and the schedule does not favor NC State the next couple of weeks, but this is a solid team that will hurt some feelings going forward.
29. Ole Miss Rebels
The Rebels have good guards in Terence Davis, Breein Tyree and Devontae Shuler, and their home win over Auburn and road win at Mississippi State have made believers of many. Ole Miss can score. Blake Hinson can stretch the defense, and Dominik Olejniczak can protect the rim pretty well. Ole Miss is not a pushover and should be an NCAA tournament team. The Rebels play Tennessee and Kentucky only once each, both at home.
30. St. John's Red Storm
Shamorie Ponds is having a spectacular season and is putting up crazy numbers. Ponds is averaging almost 21 points and six assists per game, and he has shot more than 100 free throws this season. Five Johnnies average double figures, and Chris Mullin has one of the most talented teams in the Big East. If St. John's can defend and rebound at a higher level, the scoring can take the Johnnies places. No rebounds, no rings, though.
31. Washington Huskies
Put Mike Hopkins on the list of coaches who have done a fantastic job of turning around a program. The Huskies are Syracuse West, with a formidable zone defense to go with some good guards. Jaylen Nowell is an NBA player, and Matisse Thybulle is one of the very best defenders in the nation. At 6-foot-5, Thybulle is among the nation's leaders in steals and blocks. If Washington played man-to-man, more people would know what a great defender Thybulle is.
32. Wisconsin Badgers
The Badgers have a bona fide player of the year candidate in Ethan Happ and should continue to rack up quality wins to add to last week's Michigan victory. One possible issue for Greg Gard's crew: the 66.5 free throw percentage that ranks perilously close to 300th in Division I.
33. Mississippi State Bulldogs
Ben Howland has three experienced SEC vets in Quinndary Weatherspoon, Aric Holman and Lamar Peters, all of whom can score, hit 3s and get to the foul line. With a solid offense, Mississippi State is an NCAA tournament team.
34. Cincinnati Bearcats
The Bearcats are good but not quite as good on the glass or the defensive end as Mick Cronin's past teams. But this Cincinnati squad scores a bit more easily. Jarron Cumberland is the go-to scorer, especially from deep (more than 40 3-point field goals made). Justin Jenifer is the only other Bearcat with as many as 20.
35. Florida State Seminoles
Talent and size are not issues for Florida State. The Seminoles are huge, athletic and talented. Yet after a tough loss to Duke in which the Noles were one play away from a ""storm the court"" win, Florida State turned one loss into three, with uninspired performances against Pitt and Boston College. Disappointing. The truth is, Florida State hasn't beaten anybody formidable. Home wins against Florida, Purdue and Miami look good, but Florida State has not performed to its talent ... yet.
36. Ohio State Buckeyes
The Buckeyes play solid defense and play hard. But scoring has been inconsistent, and the Big Ten has knocked the Buckeyes around out of the gate. C.J. Jackson has been the primary perimeter shooting threat, but no other Buckeye has more than 30 3-point field goals made.
37. Texas Longhorns
The Longhorns have been up and down, but they are always right there to win. The only thing standing in the way of a better record has been consistent perimeter shooting. Keep your eye on Jaxson Hayes. That dude can play, and he is getting better by the day.
38. Seton Hall Pirates
The Pirates have taken on water a bit since those wins over Kentucky and Maryland in the nonconference, but I still believe in guard Myles Powell. Powell has 56 3s this season, more than double that of anyone else on Kevin Willard's squad.
39. UCF Golden Knights
Johnny Dawkins has his best team at UCF, largely because of the return of his son, Michigan transfer Aubrey Dawkins. The combo of Dawkins and B.J. Taylor presents one of the better guard tandems in the country. Taylor leads the Golden Knights in scoring and gets to the foul line as often as any player in the country, while Dawkins is a complete offensive player. UCF gave one away on the road against Missouri, but the Golden Knights have otherwise been solid.
40. Oklahoma Sooners
How do you lose Trae Young and get better? Oklahoma is far better defensively, and Christian James has emerged as a reliable leading scorer. The Sooners still need to be more efficient with the ball and cut down on turnovers.
41. Arizona State Sun Devils
Luguentz Dort has cooled off a bit, which is understandable for a freshman garnering so much defensive attention. Take a look at Zylan Cheatham, a 6-foot-8 wing with a triple-double this season. The San Diego State transfer averages just under 10 rebounds per game, and he plays really hard at both ends of the floor.
42. Creighton Bluejays
That heartbreaker against Marquette has proved tough to recover from, but the Bluejays have some important things going for them. Nobody in the country shoots the ball better (59.5 effective field goal percentage), and that includes a 41.9 percent clip from 3.
43. Clemson Tigers
The Tigers are going to have plenty of opportunities to knock out quality wins in the coming weeks, but getting there is going to require them to shoot it better from the perimeter. Clemson makes just 31.2 percent from 3 and 29.9 percent in ACC play.
44. Butler Bulldogs
Kamar Baldwin is the Big East Player of the Year candidate you haven't heard enough about; the junior guard has put the Bulldogs on his back at times. He has freed up perimeter threats Sean McDermott (53 made 3s, 43.8 percent) and Paul Jorgensen (44 made 3s, 40.4 percent) for open looks.
45. Murray State Racers
If you haven't seen Ja Morant outside of SportsCenter, watch this dude play. He is Russell Westbrook and C.J. McCollum wrapped into a 6-foot-3, dynamic package. He leads the nation in assists, and he scores at will in transition and off the bounce. His athletic tools are amazing, and he has legit skills. When his defense reaches the level of his offense -- and it will because he is very good on the ball -- Morant will be the third player selected this June. And his teammates Shaq Buchanan and Tevin Brown are both outstanding players. Murray State is very good, with only close losses to Alabama and Auburn on the road.
46. Indiana Hoosiers
The Hoosiers' struggles during their five-game losing streak aren't particularly hard to pinpoint. They're shooting 26.8 percent from distance during the Big Ten portion of the schedule. Romeo Langford is talented, but he's 0-for-10 from beyond the arc in his past three outings.
47. Arizona Wildcats
The Wildcats play really hard and do a great job of defending the paint, but they cannot score enough points to beat the very best teams with any consistency. Chase Jeter has been solid with 13 points and seven rebounds per game. Brandon Randolph and Brandon Williams have carried the scoring load, with some help from Samford transfer Justin Coleman (another example of why transfers should not be discouraged). Coleman has had some really good moments for Arizona and has stabilized the point guard position.
48. Florida Gators
The advanced algorithms love the Gators, who have seven losses on their ledger, none of them embarrassing. But Mike White's team needs to start blending those with some quality wins, and senior guard KeVaughn Allen will lead that effort.
49. Baylor Bears
The Bears are going to miss Tristan Clark (knee) for the remainder of this season, but there's still a lot to like here. Yale transfer Makai Mason can really score, and Scott Drew's group gets after it on the offensive glass (fifth nationally in offensive rebound percentage).
50. San Francisco Dons
Point guard Frankie Ferrari is among the best point guards in the country. A good shooter and fantastic passer, especially passing ahead on the break, Ferrari can score, dish and win. San Francisco has lost only to Buffalo and Gonzaga in addition to an away squeaker at UCSB.
51. Notre Dame Fighting Irish
Facing Duke and Virginia in a three-day span presents a challenge and an opportunity for the Fighting Irish. They'll need to be better around the basket. The Irish are making just 43.6 percent of 2s, which ranks 14th in the ACC.
52. Temple Owls
The Owls handed Houston its only loss of the season, and it was no fluke -- Fran Dunphy's group can play. Shizz Alston Jr. is a conference player of the year candidate in the American. He has bombed 56 3s and is shooting better than 90 percent from the line.
53. New Mexico State Aggies
The Aggies are going to slow you down (18.7 seconds per possession is one of the highest in the country) and hit the glass (top 30 in both grabbing offensive rebounds and preventing them), and that's why NMSU has a great chance at its seventh NCAA appearance in the past eight years.
54. Alabama Crimson Tide
The Tide have some good pieces and a chance to take a big step this season. Alabama has been competitive in every game and has a 17-year-old point guard in Kira Lewis Jr. who is legit. There is not a big guy in the country who plays harder than Donta Hall. If John Petty can be more consistent at a high level, Alabama can move up in the Bilas Index and become an NCAA tournament team.
55. Pittsburgh Panthers
Credit to Jeff Capel for scoring strong ACC wins over Florida State and Louisville, with a team that is one of the youngest in the country. As freshman (and Pitt points and assists leader) Xavier Johnson continues to mature, watch out.
56. VCU Rams
The Atlantic 10 might get only one NCAA bid this year, and there's a great chance it will go to the Rams. Junior guard Marcus Evans, a Rice transfer, can both score and distribute for Mike Rhoades' team.
57. Minnesota Golden Gophers
Richard Pitino's Gophers have been tough to figure: getting blown out by Illinois and Boston College, beating Wisconsin and Nebraska, and pushing Michigan to the limit. More consistent perimeter shooting for a team shooting just 30.5 percent from 3 in Big Ten play would help.
58. Northwestern Wildcats
Seniors Vic Law and Dererk Pardon form one of the best frontline combos in the league. The duo is pulling down more than 30 points and 14 rebounds combined, and Pardon (65.8 percent from the floor) is particularly good around the rim.
59. Vermont Catamounts
The Catamounts are one of the consistent winners in college basketball and could end up a very tough out come tournament time. Much of that has to do with the work of 20-plus-point-per-game scorer Anthony Lamb, who could play anywhere.
60. Fresno State Bulldogs
The Bulldogs look like a contender in the Mountain West, and their perimeter work has a lot to do with that. Justin Hutson's group both shoots it well from 3 (38 percent) and defends the 3 (28.3 percent) better than just about anyone in the country.
61. Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets
A couple of early-season losses might have caused you to dismiss the Jackets, but this team handled Syracuse on the road and will go into Duke on Saturday looking to inflict similar damage. If Tech is going to take the next step, it has to take better care of the basketball (last in ACC turnover percentage) and make its free throws (ACC-worst 65.7 percent in conference games).
62. Lipscomb Bisons
The Atlantic Sun has fielded some quality teams this season, and the cream of the crop might be the Bisons, thanks to their senior-driven roster. Both Garrison Mathews and Rob Marberry can score and rebound for a team that likes to push the pace (12th in adjusted tempo, per KenPom).
63. Saint Mary's Gaels
Junior guard Jordan Ford is averaging more than 22 points per game and is on the list for best players in the country you're not hearing enough about. The Gaels have been effective by playing a halfcourt style (near the bottom of the country in possession length) and getting it to Ford near the end of the shot clock.
64. South Dakota State Jackrabbits
Mike Daum is again among the best and most productive players in the nation, averaging more than 24 points and 11 rebounds per game. His sharpshooting teammate, David Jenkins, has hit more than 60 3-point field goals and is averaging just a shade under 20 points per game. Right now, Duke's Williamson and Barrett are the only teammates averaging more than 20 points. Add Skyler Flatten, who has hit more than 50 3-point field goals, and South Dakota State has a terrific offensive team.
65. Toledo Rockets
Buffalo has been the story in the MAC this season, but the league has a bunch of teams that could ruin someone's day in the second half of March. Toledo is one of those teams. You don't want to be down late to a team that shoots 78.8 percent from the free throw line.
66. Wofford Terriers
The Terriers got some December attention for knocking off South Carolina and are fresh off a win over early season darling Furman. This is another team that might enter March with a long win streak. Senior forward Cameron Jackson (15 points and close to eight boards per game) might be this talented team's most productive player.
67. Utah State Aggies
The Aggies have a good scorer in junior guard Sam Merrill (more than 18 points per game) but are at their most menacing around the basket. They allow opponents to make just 40.7 percent of 2s (second lowest in the nation), and only Loyola-Chicago allows offensive rebounds at a lower rate.
68. East Tennessee State Buccaneers
Steve Forbes has done a tremendous job with a team that lost almost all of its key players from a year ago, with newcomers such as budding double-double machine Jeromy Rodriguez (he has done it 12 times already this season) helping this group contend right away.
"
25873544,"""I'm getting used to this as a coach because it's a little jealousy from a lot of these coaches around the country,"" Hardaway said Monday. ""I do understand that because we are NBA players trying to come back, and we didn't have any experience as college coaches. So we didn't quote, unquote, 'Pay our dues.' So the coaches and their so-called boys that are in the media, they're going to always throw jabs at us.""
The first-year coach says his Tigers still have to prove the detractors wrong by winning.
Hired in March to replace Tubby Smith, Hardaway hired former NBA players Mike Miller and Sam Mitchell, who's also a former NBA coach of the year, as assistants. Hardaway has made it clear he's tapping into his professional background to help his alma mater, including making tweaks to a year-old basketball facility on campus to bring it up to NBA quality.
His Tigers (13-7) just beat UCF, the preseason favorite in the American Athletic Conference, 77-57 this past weekend. And reaching the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2014 is Hardaway's goal in his debut season at Memphis, which faces a serious test this week with road games at Tulsa on Wednesday and at USF Bulls on Saturday.
Hardaway exchanged verbal jabs with Tennessee coach Rick Barnes a couple of days after the Vols beat the Tigers 102-92 in December. Hardaway declined to name any coaches he suspected of being jealous of his coaching staff, saying only that he hears the ""rumbling"" as they all fight for the same players in recruiting.
He said there's a bit of a backlash and negativity with the NBA approach Memphis is taking with him, Miller and Mitchell and that their NBA experience is ""a little intimidating to a lot of people.""
""For sure, I definitely feel like there's a target on my back,"" Hardaway said. ""There's a lot of people that don't want me to succeed because it's going to look like an NBA guy came back with no experience and won so of course I relish in that.""
Hardaway noted he played for some Hall of Fame coaches during his NBA career, and he also won three straight Tennessee high school basketball titles while also coaching his own AAU program.
""I'm not here to ruffle any feathers; I'm just here to win,"" Hardaway said.

25824764,"Richardson, who was accused of accepting $20,000 in bribes to steer Arizona players to certain managers and financial advisers once they turned pro, might face 18 to 24 months in prison. He is scheduled for sentencing in U.S. District Court in New York on April 24.
""Obviously, the hearing today was pretty emotional,"" said Richardson's attorney, Craig Mordock. ""Book did something that I think is hard for a lot of people to do -- to admit he did wrong. We're going to move forward, and hopefully the judge will take into account that he admitted his conduct was wrong and showed remorse.""
Richardson and two other former assistants -- USC's Tony Bland and Oklahoma State's Lamont Evans -- were arrested in September 2017 as part of the FBI's clandestine two-year investigation into college basketball corruption.
""As he admitted in court today, Emanuel Richardson, a former Arizona men's basketball coach, abused his position as a mentor and coach to student-athletes for his own personal gain,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement. ""Richardson, entrusted to help players develop as athletes and young men, instead helped himself to the cash offered by unscrupulous agents and financial advisers.""
Earlier this month, Bland pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery and admitted he accepted $4,100 to influence players. He is scheduled for sentencing April 2, though he likely won't be jailed and will serve his sentence through probation.
Evans is accused of accepting at least $22,000 in bribe money while coaching at South Carolina and Oklahoma State. It isn't known whether Evans has accepted a plea deal or will go to trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in April. His attorney, Billy Martin, hasn't responded to inquiries from ESPN.
Two other defendants indicted in the case -- former Adidas consultant Merl Code and Christian Dawkins, a runner for former NBA agent Andy Miller -- are preparing to go to trial in April, according to their attorneys.
""None of this changes our approach,"" Dawkins' attorney, Steven Haney, told ESPN earlier this month. ""Our level of fight is not going to change because of what other people do. That's not how I am, and that's not how Christian is. I believe there is conduct in this case that is not charged in the indictment and that needs to come out. We want the truth to come out, and it will come out.""
Code, Dawkins and Adidas executive James Gatto were convicted of federal fraud charges in October for funneling money from Adidas to the parents and/or guardians of high-profile recruits to steer them to sign with Adidas-sponsored schools, including Kansas, Louisville and NC State. They are scheduled for sentencing in that case on March 5.
Former Auburn assistant Chuck Person and former NBA referee Rashan Michel are scheduled to go to trial in June. Person is accused of soliciting and accepting $91,500 in bribes from an undercover cooperating witness to influence Auburn players to sign with certain financial advisers.

25870846,"The NCAA ruled that Hernandez would have to sit out the remainder of the 2018-19 season and 40 percent of next season for entering into an agreement and accepting benefits from an agent.

Hernandez has been held out of competition by the school since the start of the season while the NCAA looked into potential rules violations involving Hernandez and an agreement with Christian Dawkins. Dawkins, who worked as a runner for NBA agent Andy Miller but was looking to start his own agency, was one of three defendants found guilty of fraud in October's trial into college basketball corruption.
According to the NCAA, Hernandez agreed to receive monthly payments from an agent (Dawkins) and accepted other benefits from him as well.
Miami athletic director Blake James disagreed with the NCAA's ruling.
My statement regarding the Dewan Hernandez decision: pic.twitter.com/VVL3oJFvEm
ESPN's Mark Schlabach reported in early November that Hernandez was one of 19 players listed by Dawkins in an emailed business plan. The plan shows Dawkins planned to pay Hernandez $500 per month from September 2017 through January 2018, then $1,000 per month until April 2018.
If Hernandez had left Miami after last season, he wouldn't have had to pay the money back, according to the email. The payments would have been converted into a loan if Hernandez returned to Miami for his junior season.
There was no evidence in the email that payments were made, or that Hernandez had knowledge of the plan, and a source told Schlabach that Hernandez did not agree to any sort of payment structure.
Hernandez, a former five-star recruit and McDonald's All-American, averaged 11.4 points and 6.7 rebounds last season.

25802369,"Athletic director David Benedict, speaking before Saturday's men's basketball game against Tulane, said there remains a strong belief that UConn has become a nationally renowned university in part because of its sports success.
But he said the athletic division must examine how it is structured. He says UConn will look at all opportunities to increase revenue and cut expenses before considering cutting a sport.
""There's a lot of athletic departments over the past few years that have had to do that,"" Benedict said. ""It's probably one of the most difficult things you can do as an athletic director and an athletic department. We're going to look at all opportunities to try to deal with this prior to that, but sometimes there's inevitabilities.""
UConn on Friday announced it has self-imposed penalties as a result of violations of NCAA rules under former coach Kevin Ollie. UConn is hoping to avoid further sanctions from the NCAA.
In an NCAA financial statement released Thursday, UConn reported that total generated revenue from sports last year totaled $40.4 million, while expenses came in at $80.9 million.
Football lost $8.7 million, men's basketball $5 million and women's basketball, a perennial power, had expenses that outpaced revenues by more than $3 million.
The school, with most of its athletic programs in the American Athletic Conference, struggles to compete fiscally with similar programs in the higher revenue-generating Power 5 conferences -- the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC.
The school reported receiving $7.1 million in conference distribution funds last year and another $1 million in media rights, down from $7.3 million reported in 2017. By comparison, the average school distribution for the SEC was reported to be about $41 million, and Big Ten schools reportedly received an average of about $38.5 million.
Benedict said he believes a new media rights contract for the AAC, which is currently being negotiated, could help the school ""make a dent"" in the budget gap.
Benedict also said he believes Friday's announcement of self-imposed sanctions on the basketball program, which include a loss of a scholarship next season, are an appropriate response to NCAA violations under former coach Kevin Ollie.
Those violations also included: Ollie shooting baskets with a recruit during an unofficial visit to the school, and Ollie arranging improper training sessions with a friend who is a personal trainer both on campus and during out-of-state trips that amounted to improper gifts.
Ollie, who was fired after a 14-18 season last year, is challenging the school's decision to withhold more than $10 million from him as a result of being fired ""for cause."" He has asserted that any violations were minimal and isolated. He has also alleged his firing was in part racially motivated, pointing out that violations under former coach Jim Calhoun, who is white, did not lead to Calhoun's firing.
Benedict refused to comment on those allegations.
""This is certainly something that we'd prefer not to be dealing with right now, but we're going to handle it in the best way we possibly can and move forward,"" he said.
Benedict also defended handing out thousands of dollars in bonuses to UConn football coach Randy Edsall and his staff despite a 1-11 season, saying the coaches' base salaries are among the lowest in the conference, and he has no problem incentivizing performance.

25810797,"The Gators announced the news Sunday, one day after their 62-52 victory in Athens and after Stone underwent further testing.
The 6-foot-8 junior from Deerfield Beach averaged 6.1 points and 3.9 rebounds in 17 games this season, including 13 starts. He scored eight points in nine minutes before landing awkwardly on his left leg while trying to block a shot against the Bulldogs.
Coach Mike White says ""we're really disappointed for Keith. You could see he was playing with confidence (Saturday), and you hate to see a guy go down at any time.""
Losing Stone leaves Florida shorthanded in the frontcourt, where forward Chase Johnson transferred last month and big men Isaiah Stokes and Gorjok Gak have played sparingly because of injuries and fitness levels.

25829098,"Very little, if anything, has fazed Zion Williamson during his freshman season at Duke.
Not even Jay-Z sitting courtside.
Box scores and game tape show how stacked Duke's roster is this season. So do our fun and slightly capricious power rankings.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
Williamson hit his first 10 shots and scored 25 points on Tuesday night as the No. 2 Blue Devils had little trouble in a clinical 79-64 victory over host Pittsburgh and coach Jeff Capel, a former Duke assistant.
Afterward, the talk shifted to Jay-Z, arguably the greatest rapper of all time, who sat front row and watched Williamson and teammate RJ Barrett (26 points) show why Duke is must-watch basketball every time the Blue Devils take the court.
""That was like a dream come true,'' Williamson said. ""To me, he's the GOAT.""
Jay-Z's representatives reached out to Pitt a few weeks ago about stopping by for Tuesday night's game.
Williamson said the rapper's song ""A Dream"" is on his pregame playlist.
""When he walks in, with his squad, you look over and you're like, 'Oh my God, that's him,'"" Williamson said.
The freshman wasn't the only person to notice. Pittsburgh quarterback Kenny Pickett also was at the game and took some pictures with Jay-Z.

As for the game itself, Williamson went 9-for-9 in the first half and finished 11-of-13 overall while adding seven assists and seven rebounds. He insisted he wasn't keeping track of his hot start. He didn't have to; his teammates were doing it for him.
""I said [at halftime], 'I got like 10 points right now; I'm not really doing nothing,''' Williamson said. ""I come in here and they tell me what I got, and I was like, 'Dang.'''

The performance left Capel, who helped recruit Williamson and Barrett to Duke, impressed.
Capel said that the last time he watched an opposing freshman score as easily as Williamson came a decade ago when he was coaching Oklahoma against Texas. The Longhorns had a freshman in early 2007 named Kevin Durant.
Capel remembers looking up and seeing Durant with 20 points halfway through the first half.
""I said [that night], 'There's nothing we can do about this,''' Capel said. ""It's kind of the same with Zion. He's very unique. He's very, very unique.''
