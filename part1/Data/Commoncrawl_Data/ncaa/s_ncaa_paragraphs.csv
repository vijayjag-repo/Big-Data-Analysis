25923557,"Editor's note: The NCAA tournament Bubble Watch has been updated through the games of Saturday.
We know that Kentucky, Tennessee and LSU are the three best teams in the SEC, we just don't know in what order. The Wildcats have muddied the picture by losing at home to the Tigers in the last second of the game but then beating the Volunteers by 17 at Rupp just four nights later.
The one thing we do know, however, is that collectively Kentucky, Tennessee and LSU form one of the strongest trios the league has seen in a long time. In fact, these are the best of times for SEC hoops.
For starters, the conference is poised to make its biggest splash on the top four seed lines of the NCAA tournament bracket in 17 years. Consider Joe Lunardi's projected bracket.
Lunardi has Tennessee as a No. 1 seed, Kentucky as a No. 2 and LSU on the No. 4 line. If those seeds hold on Selection Sunday, it will mark the SEC's best showing at the top of the bracket since 2002.
The actual bracket is still a month away from being released, of course, but current projections reveal the extent to which the SEC may be rising while other major conferences are in danger of taking a step back.
True, the ACC and Big Ten look about the same as last season in terms of throwing their top-four-seed weight around. But what appears likely is that the SEC's rise in this category is being fueled by significant year-to-year declines recorded by both the Big 12 and the Big East.
Here's how we're projecting the bubble right now:
Bids from traditional ""one-bid"" leagues: 23 teams
Locks: 17 teams
The bubble: 34  teams for 28 available spots
Should be in: 13 teams
Work to do: 21  teams
ACC | Big 12| Big East | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC | American | Others

Locks: Virginia, Duke, North Carolina, Louisville
Should be in: Virginia Tech, Florida State, Syracuse
Work to do: NC State, Clemson
Virginia Tech Hokies 
Virginia Tech's conference opponents are attempting a truly historic number of 3s. Meaning in the history of major-conference play dating back over the last decade and beyond, we've never seen a defense allow this many 3-point attempts. To be sure, this hasn't prevented the Hokies' D from clocking in right at the league average for points allowed per possession. Still, if this potential No. 5 seed is paired with a perimeter-oriented opponent in a March bracket (Villanova?), be aware that the potential exists for opponent-induced 3-point mayhem.
(Updated: Feb. 14)
Florida State Seminoles 
With wins over not only Purdue and LSU but also Louisville, those mid-January losses at Boston College and at Pittsburgh actually loom a bit larger. Indeed, at the time, it seemed like the whole season might go sideways for Leonard Hamilton's men. Instead, those losses are now looking more and more like underachievement from a team whose other defeats came at the hands of Villanova, Virginia and Duke. Florida State's now won seven straight and is cruising toward a No. 6 seed (if not better) with the league's best 2-point FG defense in ACC play. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Syracuse Orange
It's not easy winning road games in the ACC, certainly, but the concern for Syracuse goes beyond a 15-point loss at NC State. The concern is that Jim Boeheim's group, never presumed to be a high-powered offense, is scoring at a rate that's low by even the most modest expectations. In the past three outings, Oshae Brissett, Tyus Battle and their teammates have produced just 0.89 points per possession. Scoring from beyond the arc has been in particularly short supply, and Syracuse has given the ball away on 21 percent of its possessions in those games. To recap, this is a team nominally in line for a No. 8 or 9 seed but one that's also in a scoring slump as it prepares to host Louisville and Duke at the Carrier Dome. There's a lot on the line for the Orange in the coming days. (Updated: Feb. 13)
NC State Wolfpack 
Bubble Watch is on the record as hyping the importance of NC State's current two-game swing. Well, halfway into said swing, Kevin Keatts' men are taking care of business. The Wolfpack beat Syracuse 73-58 in Raleigh, giving this group what could (depending what Clemson does) turn out to be its first win over an eventual NCAA tournament team since it defeated Auburn back in December. Now comes the mother of all ACC opportunities: Duke in Cameron Indoor. Torin Dorn and his teammates are being projected as a No. 9 or 10 seed, but needless to say, a win in Durham this weekend could alter that expectation. (Updated: Feb. 13)
Clemson Tigers
Brad Brownell's team has announced its arrival in Bubble Watch -- with back-to-back, one-point losses. That can happen. Bubble Watch, like the committee itself, takes the long, whole-season view, and losing consecutive nail-biters at Miami and at Louisville is not in itself a deal-breaker. At 5-7 in ACC play but with an eight-point win over Virginia Tech at Littlejohn Coliseum serving as this team's headline statement, the Tigers are projected as a No. 10 or 11 seed. Then again, the loss at the hand of the Hurricanes was Clemson's third Quad 2 defeat of the season. In sum, a 5-7 conference record in mid-February does raise the stakes for looming home dates against Florida State and North Carolina, not to mention upcoming road games against the Quad 2 likes of Pittsburgh and Notre Dame.(Updated: Feb. 16)

Locks: Kansas, Texas Tech
Should be in: Iowa State, Kansas State
Work to do: Baylor, TCU, Texas, Oklahoma
Iowa State Cyclones 
The loss at home to TCU was not only surprising, it reduced Iowa State's chances of winning a share of the Big 12 title. In terms of NCAA seeding impact, however, a single defeat at the hands of (one presumes) another at-large team, even at home, isn't going to move the needle all that much. Falling to the Horned Frogs represented the Cyclones' second Quad 2 loss of the season, but Wisconsin also made its way to the No. 4 line in the bracket preview and the Badgers had already lost two Quad 2 games. This isn't a deal-breaker for ISU, just as long as the Clones don't get it into their heads to keep doing this kind of thing. (Updated: Feb. 9)
Kansas State Wildcats 
It is time to ponder whether the team that might (repeat, might) end the incredible 14-year streak of Kansas conference titles might not also be a threat for a really nice seed. One thing we know already is that Kansas State is making opponents uncomfortable. For a second consecutive season, the Wildcats lead the Big 12 in opponent turnover percentage in conference play. That might sound like the mark of a team that's pressing full court and trying to speed up the tempo, but Bruce Weber's guys actually play at the slowest pace in the league. Most importantly, that strategy is working. Kansas State is a projected No. 6 seed right now, but that might not be the end of the story. (Updated: Feb. 12)
Baylor Bears 
Scott Drew's team is still struggling to get healthy and whole. King McClure has now missed three straight games due to an ailing knee, and Makai Mason has been in and out of action while struggling with a toe issue. Both players missed the Bears' 86-61 loss at Texas Tech. Devonte Bandoo has done some heroic work in February trying to fill the absence of two starters with 3-pointers, but a 25-point defeat in Lubbock suggests Drew needs McClure and Mason back sooner rather than later. The population of teams in a strong Big 12 that can beat a shorthanded version of a projected No. 8 seed such as Baylor is fairly large. (Updated: Feb. 16)
TCU Horned Frogs 
In a Big 12 that's hardly lacking for good defense, TCU is trending toward being the exception to that rule. Indeed, among the league's eight teams that are playing for NCAA tournament position, the Horned Frogs are the outlier on D, allowing 1.08 points per possession in conference play. That's not an outlandish figure, but TCU's interior defense in particular is looking shaky. The Big 12 has converted 54 percent of its 2-pointers against the Frogs, and in Oklahoma's nine-point win in Fort Worth, Kristian Doolittle lit up Jamie Dixon's guys to the tune of 21 points on 8-of-11 shooting inside the arc. If TCU does land around the No. 8 line as expected, a top seed could find the paint to its liking on offense in the round of 32. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Texas Longhorns 
Call it luck, karma or toughness in crunch time, but Texas looks stronger statistically than your ordinary 7-6 Big 12 team. Those six losses, by the way, have come by a combined 27 points. The Longhorns are expected to draw something in the neighborhood of a No. 9 seed, and this group could definitely give a top seed a game in the round of 32. With a neutral-floor win over North Carolina to their credit (not to mention wins at home over Purdue and Kansas), Shaka Smart's men make up possibly the most dangerous 15-11 team you've ever seen. Yes, that's a non sequitur. Sometimes those are true. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Oklahoma Sooners 
To this point in 2019 calendar year, OU has defeated one at-large-quality opponent, and now the Sooners have done so twice this season. In earning the season sweep over TCU, Lon Kruger's men looked more impressive than they have at any point in the conference season. Oklahoma threw a stingy zone defense at the Horned Frogs in Schollmaier Arena, and the visitors cruised to a 71-62 win. OU is still very much in double-digit seed territory (this is, after all, a team that's 4-9 in the Big 12 and 16-10 overall), but for the first time in a long time, the Sooners look capable of playing in a manner that will keep them in the bracket. (Updated: Feb. 16)

Lock: Marquette
Should be in: Villanova
Work to do: St. John's, Seton Hall, Butler
Villanova Wildcats 
Few coaches talk a better woe-are-we game than Jay Wright. By that, of course, Bubble Watch refers to the art of talking like you or your team isn't very good even though you or your team is in fact very good. The coach who has won two of the past three national titles has been at it again this month (""We're not a great team. We're just trying to keep getting better""), and it's true that this group of Wildcats is no match for what we saw a year ago. Nevertheless, presumptive 2019 No. 5 seed Villanova is doing highly impressive and indeed game-changing work in the area of shot volume. In particular, the Wildcat program can boast a ridiculously low, league-leading turnover percentage in Big East play for a second consecutive season. Listen to what Wright says but also watch what his team does. (Updated: Feb. 13)
St. John's Red Storm
""Welcome back to another episode of 'We swept Marquette.' We're your hosts, the St. John's Red Storm. We just won a home game against Butler, 77-73 in overtime. John Gasaway would probably say that's not that big a deal, but losing certainly would have been. Now we're up to .500 in Big East play, showing up in the mock brackets as a No. 9 seed and getting ready to host Villanova at the Garden this weekend. Sounds like we could be moving up to 'should be in' very soon. Join us again next time, and remember: We swept Marquette."" (Updated: Feb. 12)
Seton Hall Pirates 
Myles Powell was apparently tired of Markus Howard getting all the attention for high-volume scoring in the Big East. The junior went off for 30 points, punctuated by 10-of-10 shooting at the line, as Seton Hall cruised past Georgetown 90-75 in Newark. Just two weeks removed from a four-game losing streak, the Pirates are back to .500 in conference play, thanks to victories at home over Creighton and the Hoyas. That said, no team projected as a No. 12 seed can feel too comfortable, and this weekend's game against the Bluejays in Omaha could be tougher than it looks. Greg McDermott's team carries a 4-8 record in the Big East, but three of those losses came in overtime. (Updated: Feb. 13)
Butler Bulldogs 
At 6-7 in Big East play and with its marquee win being a neutral-floor victory over Florida, Butler badly needs to upgrade its profile. The Bulldogs have road games remaining at Marquette and Villanova, and a win in at least one of those contests is now looking more or less essential for a team listed as ""first four out"" by Lunardi. (Updated: Feb. 16)

Locks: Michigan State, Michigan, Purdue
Should be in: Wisconsin, Maryland, Iowa
Work to do: Ohio State, Minnesota, Indiana
Wisconsin Badgers 
Life is brutal at the top of the Big Ten. Ethan Happ has scored 38 points and pulled down 23 rebounds in the past two games, and all that got Wisconsin was losses to Michigan and Michigan State. Nick Ward was particularly effective on Happ for the Spartans, forcing the Badgers senior into six turnovers and making him take 20 shots to get his 20 points. Now Greg Gard's team, which is 0-2 since it was tapped as a No. 4 seed in the NCAA's bracket preview, gets a welcome six days of rest before returning to the court at home against Illinois. (Updated: Feb. 12)
Maryland Terrapins 
If you've watched Maryland this season, you've likely been told this is one of the youngest teams in the country. That is indeed correct, and it helps explain both how good this team is and how great it could become. As one would expect from a youthful group, the Terrapins have suffered from an exceedingly large turnover disparity in Big Ten play. Take turnovers out of that equation, however, and Bruno Fernando, Anthony Cowan and company can play with, literally, anyone. In the Terps' 13-point loss at Michigan, for example, this young team that's a presumed No. 6 seed actually came close (1.08 points per no-turnover possession) to matching the Wolverines (1.10) on turnover-neutral scoring. The fact that Maryland committed 16 turnovers and U-M had just six, however, translated into a double-digit margin of defeat. (Updated Feb. 16)
Iowa Hawkeyes 
If you're not watching Iowa, you're missing hands-down the most entertaining team in the nation, world, you name it. Not content to merely beat Northwestern with a last-second 3 by Jordan Bohannon in Iowa City, the Hawkeyes took their cardiac-kids routine to Rutgers. This time it was Joe Wieskamp who hit the last second game-winner off of a deflected full-court baseball pass, with the added kicker that it was a corner 3 that actually grazed the backboard. (Are you not entertained?) It's two wins, regardless of how Iowa happened to get it done. Fran McCaffery's men are 20-5 and heading toward a potential No. 6 seed.(Updated: Feb. 16)
Ohio State Buckeyes
A 63-56 loss at home to Illinois constitutes a Quad 3 defeat for Ohio State, the team's first such setback. In other words, the game is literally the Buckeyes' worst loss of the season in profile terms. Then again, Baylor's walking around whistling a happy tune in the brackets as a projected No. 8 seed even though the Bears have suffered two Quad 4 losses. Meaning the worry for OSU isn't necessarily the loss itself, one that this team's profile can well absorb. (Yet another reason why that win at Cincinnati is so valuable.) Rather, the concern is whether the outcome marks a new turn for the worse in performance. (Updated: Feb. 15)
Minnesota Golden Gophers 
When last we checked in on the Gophers, Bubble Watch had this to say: ""Minnesota is a 6-8 Big Ten team being shown as a No. 11 seed in mid-February. Everything in that sentence fairly screams, 'Win some games.'"" The good news for Richard Pitino's men is that they are now a 7-8 Big Ten team being shown as a No. 11 seed after they thrashed Indiana 84-63 at Williams Arena. Now the table is set for the big one: Michigan is coming to the Twin Cities, and a win there, paired with the road victory the Gophers already recorded at Wisconsin, would push this team a long way toward ""should be in"" status. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Indiana Hoosiers 
You're wondering why an Indiana team that's 4-10 in the Big Ten and has lost 10 of its past 11 is still here after losing by 21 on the road to a Minnesota team that is itself kind of bubbly. That's easy. The Hoosiers are here because they started that game as proud members of a number of reputable mock brackets. IU was able to attain that status, of course, because that 11th game in the recent stretch was, incredibly, a win at Michigan State. Pair that with victories against Marquette and Louisville and you have a profile that could get you in the field of 68 if Indiana decides to start winning games. But, right now, the Hoosiers really don't look like they're going to decide to start winning games.(Updated: Feb. 16)

Should be in: Washington
Work to do: Arizona State
Washington Huskies 
Mike Hopkins' men will likely reach Selection Sunday showing a road victory at Oregon as their best win. That may not sound particularly impressive, but this is in fact the Pac-12's best per-possession team by a healthy margin, one that's likely to post a gaudy W-L record in conference play. All of the above may well result in a seed in the middle of the bracket and, consequently, a game against a high seed in the round of 32.. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Arizona State Sun Devils 
The Sun Devils would likely be in the field of 68, barely, if the selection were held today. Absent the most extreme string of either wins or losses in the arid Quad-1-scarce savannah known as the Pac-12, ASU could remain in this state of bubbly uncertainty for the foreseeable future. True, the upcoming road game at Oregon would in fact qualify as Quad 1 at this writing. Nevertheless, Arizona State has already done its best work under this heading, having won at home against Kansas and Washington and in Las Vegas against Mississippi State and Utah State. (Updated: Feb. 16)

Locks: Tennessee, Kentucky, LSU
Should be in:  Mississippi State, Auburn, Ole Miss
Work to do: Alabama, Florida
Mississippi State Bulldogs 
Just hours before MSU tipped off its game at Arkansas, the athletic department in Starkville announced that 6-foot-2 sophomore Nick Weatherspoon had been suspended indefinitely due to an unspecified violation of team rules. That was no issue against the Razorbacks, as Ben Howland's team won 77-67. Indeed, Howland can put Tyson Carter in Weatherspoon's starting spot, as the coach did in Fayetteville, and see a similar level of performance. Losing depth is never a positive, of course, but it's not clear the suspension will have a significant impact in the near term on a team that's being envisioned as a No. 7 seed. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Auburn Tigers 
The knock on the Tigers is that that they're an efficient bunch beloved of laptops but that, oh by the way, Auburn doesn't actually beat any good teams. Bruce Pearl's men are just 2-5 against SEC opponents listed as locks, should-be in's or work-to-do's by Bubble Watch, and the wins came at home against Alabama and Florida. AU won't get a chance to change its ""all stats, no statements"" reputation until it plays at Kentucky next weekend. In the meantime, a team that's being shown as anything from a No. 7 to a No. 9 seed would be well advised to take care of business mid-week at home against Arkansas.(Updated: Feb. 13)
Ole Miss Rebels
Ole Miss has what might be the cleanest profile an 18-7 team could construct for itself. Every one of those seven losses, for example, falls under the heading of Quad 1. Plus, the Rebels now own road wins not only against Auburn, but also at Mississippi State. If Kermit Davis and his men emerge at 20-7 after this current take-care-of-business interlude (Ole Miss won at home against Missouri and will now visit South Carolina before returning to Oxford to play Georgia), we might be envisioning the Rebels as a step up from a No. 8 seed. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Alabama Crimson Tide 
As a genre that has proliferated over the past decade or so, the bubble watch typically exists to overreact to the most recent game played. Naturally, we here capital-B-and-W Bubble Watch would never stoop to such hackery, so you can trust us when we say Alabama's most recent game was aberrantly damaging to the Crimson Tide's bracket position. Avery Johnson's team entered its home game against Florida as a projected No. 10 seed, but losing 71-53 in Tuscaloosa to an opponent that started the contest 13-11 and ranked No. 40 in the NET does you no seeding favors. Alabama would still likely make the tournament if the selection were held today, but something as low-profile as the upcoming road game at Texas A&M now takes on added importance. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Florida Gators 
Look who's still hanging around in ""first four out"" territory. The Gators are now 14-11 and 6-6 in SEC play, not numbers that necessarily translate seamlessly into ""at-large."" Then again, this is also a group with two Quad 1 wins (at Arkansas and at Alabama) and a NET ranking that has been hovering in the 30s and 40s. The 18-point victory at Tuscaloosa was, easily, the Gators' most complete performance of the conference season and could not have come at a better time. LSU is up next, in Baton Rouge. (Updated: Feb. 16)

Lock: Houston
Should be in: Cincinnati
Work to do: UCF, Temple
Cincinnati Bearcats
Mick Cronin's team went scoreless over the final 6:11 of the game and lost 65-58 at Houston. Jarron Cumberland scored 27 points for UC (albeit on 25 shots), but it was not to be. The outcome represents a lost chance to earn a higher seed, far and away the best single opportunity the Bearcats will get before Selection Sunday. Then again, there's no shortage of teams in the American or, indeed, nationally, that would gladly switch places with a group cruising toward something in the neighborhood of a No. 7 seed. (Updated: Feb. 10)
UCF Knights
Give UCF credit. The Knights have shown an unmistakable ability to cling tenaciously to what's supposed to be a precarious spot: the very bottom of the at-large field. According to Joe Lunardi, Johnny Dawkins' team would be one of the last teams in the field not sent to Dayton if the season ended today. That status is holding steady after UCF took care of South Florida at home 78-65. The Knights will get the opportunity to strengthen their hold on an at-large bid thanks to two remaining games against Cincinnati and one at Houston. First up, however, is a home date against Memphis. (Updated: Feb. 13)
Temple Owls
Speaking of the very bottom of the at-large field, Temple is moving in somewhat the same bubble circles as UCF. The Knights have the superior NET ranking (in the 40s, versus the 50-something rank carried by the Owls), but of course, it's Fran Dunphy's men who have the win to end all American wins: Houston's only loss of the season came against Temple on Jan. 9 in the Liacouras Center. One potential worry for the Owls, however, is that barring an encounter in the conference tournament, their games against the Cougars and the Bearcats are already in the books. There'll be no more regular-season chances at the biggest wins in the conference. Then again, Temple and UCF meet head-to-head in the last game of the season in Philadelphia. That showdown could have a bubble implication or three. (Updated: Feb. 13)

Buffalo Bulls 
Congratulations, Bulls. You navigated what on paper looked to be a challenging two-game road swing and came away passing with flying colors. Wins at Akron and at Toledo mean Nate Oats' team now has a realistic shot at winning out the rest of the way. Running the table would give Buffalo a 16-2 record in the MAC, but even dropping a game along the way, as UB already did at Northern Illinois and at Bowling Green, wouldn't wreck a profile that includes a win at Syracuse. UB appears to be heading for something in the neighborhood of a No. 7 seed.
(Updated: Feb. 16)
Wofford Terriers
The Southern Conference has never sent an at-large team to the NCAA tournament, but there's a first time for everything. Wofford is in this discussion because the Terriers are 23-4, with the losses coming to North Carolina, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mississippi State. Mike Young's team additionally own Quad 1 wins at UNC Greensboro and East Tennessee State. Finally, it's worth noting Wofford won at South Carolina by 20, even though that shows up on the profile as a Quad 2 victory.(Updated: Feb. 16)
VCU Rams
If Bubble Watch is correct to be bullish on how well a somewhat underrated Texas team might perform the rest of the way, the correctness will be good news for VCU. Any impressive exploits yet to be recorded by the Longhorns can only add luster to the tournament profile of a Rams team that went to Austin on Dec. 5 and came away with a 54-53 win. (Feast your eyes, the score itself says ""hard-fought."") Will that profile be enough to get Mike Rhoades' team an at-large bid? Quite possibly, but make no mistake, recent selection history doesn't furnish too many feel-good precedents. It's likely to be a close call. (Updated: Feb. 13)
Lipscomb Bisons
Welcome to the fun, Bisons. We here at Bubble Watch Mission Control have been watching you for a while now. You can be justly proud of Rob Marberry's Ethan Happ-like post mastery (with better foul shooting), the team-wide attention to detail and total mastery on the defensive glass and, yes, your road win at TCU in November. Historically speaking, the at-large-bid production of the Atlantic Sun has not been what one would term voluminous, but your combination of the marquee win with a 30-ish ranking in the NCAA Evaluation Tool promises to make this an interesting next few weeks. Congratulations, and one last thing. You can thank your ranked-60-something-in-the-RPI lucky stars that the old metric is gone. Bubble Watch rejoices with you there.

25972895,"The NCAA Division I Basketball Committee slated Duke as the No. 1 overall seed in its initial tournament rankings over the weekend. Voters in the AP Top 25 stuck with Tennessee as their top team.
The Vols received 40 of 64 first-place votes from a media panel in the poll released Monday, remaining ahead of Duke for fourth straight week. The No. 2 Blue Devils had 24 first-place votes.
First-place votes in parentheses
No. 3 Gonzaga and No. 4 Virginia, the other top seeds in the NCAA's initial rankings Saturday, rounded out the top five with Kentucky.
Tennessee (22-1, 10-0 SEC) moved to the No. 1 spot in the AP poll after Duke (21-2, 9-1 ACC) lost to Syracuse on Jan. 14.
The Vols continued winning, stretching their school-record streak to 18 games with wins over Missouri and Florida last week.
Committee chair Bernard Muir said the decision for the top overall seed was close, but Blue Devils edged the Vols based on strength of schedule.
Tennessee was No. 1 in the South Region.
""I want these guys to enjoy what they're doing and I'm probably not the easiest guy to let that happen because I'm always thinking of ways we can get better, and I want to do it right now,"" Vols coach Rick Barnes said. ""I appreciate how hard they're competed and the fact that they want to get better.""
The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee gives Duke the top seed over Tennessee in its initial rankings. ""It was 1A and 1B,"" committee chairman Bernard Muir said.
Duke won both of its games last week, rolling over Boston College by 25 before winning a rematch with Virginia 81-71 on Saturday. The Blue Devils needed overtime to beat the Cavaliers the first meeting and shot them out of the gym in the second, making 13 of 21 from the 3-point arc.
""We were just in our zone and it's great to see when our team is like that,"" said Duke's RJ Barrett, who had 26 points and was 6-for-10 on 3s.
Virginia dropped one spot after losing to the Blue Devils.
BIG 12 RACE
Kansas State moved back into the poll this week at No. 18.
Perhaps more importantly, the Wildcats are in control of the Big 12 race after knocking off rival Kansas and Baylor last week.
The Wildcats (18-5) are 8-2 in the Big 12, putting them 1½ games ahead of the 14th-ranked Jayhawks, No. 15 Texas Tech and No. 23 Iowa State. Kansas State plays Texas and Iowa State this week.
Kansas will need to make a late-season run for the second straight year if it is going to stretch its record run of conference titles to 15. The Jayhawks play TCU and West Virginia.
ZIGGING ZAGS
Gonzaga moved up a spot in the AP poll this week, was selected as the top overall seed in the West by the NCAA's selection committee and crushed WCC rival Saint Mary's 94-46 on Saturday.
But it wasn't all good news for the Zags last week.
Gonzaga forward Killian Tillie did not play against the Gaels and is out indefinitely after suffering a torn ligament in his right foot against San Francisco on Thursday. He missed the first two months of the season due to a foot injury and has played just nine games.
MOVING UP
No. 17 Florida State had the biggest jump in this week's poll, climbing five spots after beating Syracuse and Louisville, which remained at No. 16 despite the loss.
No. 9 Houston and No. 12 Purdue each moved up three spots.
MOVING DOWN
No. 22 Virginia Tech had a precipitous drop this week, falling 11 spots after losses to Louisville and Clemson.
DROPPING OUT
A week after moving into the poll at No. 25, Cincinnati dropped out beating Memphis and losing to Houston last week.

Brown officiated in four of UCLA's Final Fours in the 1960s and '70s. He forged strong working relationships with everyone from Bob Knight to Dick Vitale, who tweeted that Brown had the whistle for his last appearance as a coach in the NCAA tournament in 1977.
Brown was a fixture on talk radio in Denver, working with longtime partner Joe Williams on shows that spanned four decades.
He also coached baseball at Colorado before that program was shut down in 1980. Always quick with a quip, he once said: ""I made CU baseball what it is today. Extinct.""
Brown was in the booth for ESPN's first college football telecast, a game between Colorado and Oregon in 1979.
""ESPN is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Denver legend, Irv Brown,"" the company said in a statement Sunday.

The casual, two-step, broad-jump dunk bonus (+11): When he got the steal on Shamorie Ponds in the first half of the St. John's game, took a few steps and just sailed to the rim, it looked like a trailer for another Marvel film. That why's all of these kids will be wearing the Air Zions next year.
Unintentionally endangering an opponent's future deduction (3): Check the tape. Early in the Boston College win, Ky Bowman (6-foot-1, 188 pounds) tried to put a body on Williamson on the block. It was a commendable, albeit, dangerous effort. Bowman caught a shoulder to the chest and moved back about four feet before Williamson grabbed a rebound and scored on a putback. Bowman had that ""What are the chances I'm bleeding on the inside?"" look after that play. Go play with the big kids, Zion!
Missed dunk deduction (-6): I'm just mad he missed it. Had Williamson pulled off that fast-break reverse on Boston College, the ACC would have been forced to temporarily boot the Eagles out of the league. But we were robbed on that fast break. A guy in the front row hugged his friend after realizing he was so close to an ""I was there"" moment.
2. Tre Jones (33 points)
Raw stats (+9): Ask Shamorie Ponds, the potential All-American who went 3-for-11 in a loss to Duke with Jones stuck to him like student loan debt 10 years after graduation.
Advanced stats (+9): Ask Ponds.
You gotta see it to believe it bonus (+10): It's remarkable.
Another bonus (+5): Ask Ponds.
T3. R.J. Barrett (27 points)
Raw stats (+8): He averaged 17.0 PPG in wins over St. John's and Boston College.
Advanced stats (+7): With Tre Jones, Cam Reddish, Williamson and Barrett, Duke was plus-22 in the win over St. John's, per ESPN Stats & Info.
The R.J. Play (+7): On the first play of the win over Boston College, Barrett drove through three Eagles to get the bucket.
A shooters shoot deduction (-4): Barrett went 2-for-9 from the 3-point line in that two-game stretch.
The R.J. just gets buckets bonus (+3): Early in the second half against St. John's, Barrett casually dribbled up the court and scored through a trio of players on an easy drive.
""Joining the list of imposing Canadians"" bonus (+6): He's not that far behind Ryan Reynolds, Keanu Reaves and Jim Carrey at this point.
T3. Cam Reddish (27 points)
Raw stats (+7): Averaged 20.0 PPG (12-for-26, 38 percent from beyond the arc) in Duke's past two wins. OK, we see you!
Advanced stats (+9): Reddish was 4-for-6 on his jumpers in the second half of Duke's win over Boston College, per ESPN Stats & Info.
The Klay Thompson role bonus (+6): It's not easy to play with all of this talent, but over the last three games, he's really stepped into his role.
A math matters bonus (+5): If you pause the action at 16:21 of Duke's win over St. John's, you'll see three players collapse on a driving Jones, another player stay next to Williamson and another standing near Barrett. Reddish had enough time to post on Snapchat from his spot wide open on the arc, where he sank a 3-pointer.
5. Marques Bolden (15 points)
Raw stats (+5): Averaged 8.0 PPG, 1.0 BPG in two wins.
Advanced stats (+6): He finished 7-for-11 in Duke's most recent wins.
A ""That's exactly what Duke needs from you, Marques"" bonus (+7): Two minutes into the win over St. John's, he contested Marvin Clark Jr.'s 3-point attempt before he spun off the left block and scored over Clark on the other end of the floor. That's who you gotta be, Bolden!
A ""Who told you to do that, Marques!"" (-3): He took and missed a pair of 3-pointers against St. John's. OK, and the lie detector test determined those shots were lies. Nothing wrong with a big man shooting 3-pointers. But Bolden is 0-for-5 for his career. Now is not the time to start trying things that don't work in practice.
6. Javin DeLaurier (12 points)
Raw stats (+4): He had five points in limited action against St. John's.
Advanced stats (+4): He extended a streak of six consecutive games without a turnover.
Big play bonus (+4): Nice layup midway through the second half against St. John's.
7. Jack White (8 points)
Raw stats (+3): Two blocks and two steals in Duke's most recent wins.
Advanced stats (+3): Didn't log big minutes, but he played hard.
Good effort bonus (+2): With Duke up 30 over St. John's, White put up a 3-pointer over two players as the shot clock expired. Didn't make it, but he bet on himself. That's the Jack White that Duke needs.
8. Alex O'Connell (7 points)
Raw stats (+2): Four points in two games.
Advanced stats (+2): Played 21 minutes combined.
Stay ready bonus (+3): Hit a jump shot off the bench late in the second half against Boston College. O'Connell is always ready to go.

25923215,"It's another edition of What's Real/What's Fake in college basketball, and if it's your first time with us here, this is where we separate the real from the hype in the college hoops landscape. So, let's get to it ...
At this point in most seasons, with the Super Bowl in the books, a multitude of casual fans prepping for their office pools will usually wander over to college basketball. If you're in that category, you should know you've missed an abundance of developments in the first three months of the season.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
Indiana's win at Michigan State can be a launching pad to the tourney, and other college hoops hot takes I can prove.
But we'll do our best to help you get caught up:
1. The Big 12 title streak might end for Kansas .... or not. Kansas has endured every possible problem. Udoka Azubuike is out for the season and now Silvio De Sousa has been ruled ineligible, a byproduct of the FBI's bribery investigation. And the Jayhawks, who have lost three of their past five games, have been a middle-of-the-pack offensive and defensive team in Big 12 play. Plus, they lost Marcus Garrett (7.2 PPG) to an ankle injury before Saturday's game against Texas Tech.
With a collection of teams -- Baylor, Iowa State, Kansas State and Texas Tech -- in the mix at the top of the league, Kansas hasn't looked this vulnerable in years. But Saturday's 16-point win over Texas Tech at Allen Fieldhouse highlighted KU's potential, especially when Dedric Lawson (25 points, 10 rebounds, 2 blocks) is dominant. The Jayhawks still have road games against Kansas State and Texas Tech ahead. But don't put your money on another team winning the Big 12 title and stopping KU from extending its run to 15 consecutive titles just yet. With four home games remaining on its conference schedule and Lawson playing like an All-American, it's still too early to make any assumptions in the Big 12 race.
2. If you thought Pac-12 football was bad, check out basketball in that league. The conference sent three teams to the NCAA tournament last year, and with a month to go in the regular season, it does not have any guaranteed invites beyond its automatic berth.
3. Gonzaga's Brandon Clarke (16.4 PPG, 3.0 BPG) is an athletic marvel.
4. Tennessee will be the king of the SEC again ... unless a Kentucky squad that hasn't lost since Jan. 5 and has risen into the top 10 in adjusted defensive efficiency after a stint in the 60s earlier this season catches the Vols.
5. The only way we're going to see Ja Morant (24.1 PPG, 10.3 APG) and his viral dunks, passes and layups in the NCAA tournament will be if Murray State wins the Ohio Valley Conference tournament, so you should root for that outcome. Trust us.
6. Zion Williamson. Google him.
7. Memphis Tigers coach Penny Hardaway said other coaches have some ""jealousy"" of him and his staff, which includes former NBA players Mike Miller and Sam Mitchell, before losing to Tulsa by 16 points and entering halftime of a road loss at South Florida on Saturday down 38-13. Hardaway has signed a top-10 recruiting class that's anchored by James Wiseman, the No. 1 recruit in the country. Hardaway is already taking steps toward reviving this program. But the timing of these comments wasn't good.
8. The Big Ten might not have a great team, but it has a bunch of good ones. And that's why the conference could send up to 10 teams -- no joke -- to the NCAA tournament.
9. After a hot and cold November and December, North Carolina, which has won its past five games by an average of 13.8 PPG, is shaping up to be a handful for any opponent in the postseason. And freshman Coby White (14.8 PPG, 4.2 APG) has matured into a young leader for a Tar Heels squad that has two matchups against Duke and a home game against Virginia remaining on their schedule.
10. Villanova lost three first-round picks and the Wooden Award winner after winning the national title last year, but the Wildcats are 9-0 atop the Big East with Phil Booth (18.7 PPG) and Eric Paschall (17.0 PPG) leading the way.
If you believe what's above, you clearly didn't watch Virginia Tech at NC State. The Wolfpack scored 24 points during a 23-point home loss to the Hokies. Per ESPN Stats & Information, 92 players scored at least 24 points on Saturday. NC State had 14 points at halftime. The over/under for the game was 152. They only missed it by 81 points.
Houston's head coach has won 21 or more games in four consecutive seasons. His current Houston squad is his second consecutive top-20 defensive team, too.
He's underrated even within the American Athletic Conference, where Gregg Marshall and Mick Cronin have been deservedly praised for their achievements in recent years. But Sampson's team has one loss this season and it's in a tie with Cincinnati for first place in the conference.
Corey Davis Jr. and Armoni Brooks are two of the most talented players in the country.
Sampson belongs in the national coach of the year convos.
The immediate reaction to the initial unveiling of the NET rankings was an emotional one. The NCAA had dropped this new barometer on us without really explaining the nuances of its formula. But the current rankings don't stray too far from what most believe about the hierarchy of college basketball. Still, until we fully understand how the NCAA came up with this formula and how it will be used on Selection Sunday, we cannot say that all is well with the NET.
Let's see what happens in February, when more teams might be searching for blowout wins because the NET caps credit for margin of victory at 10 points but heavily rewards teams according to efficiency margin. That part doesn't make sense, but coaches are clearly aware of the latter's impact on their NET standing. It'll be interesting to see what the NET looks like in March.
But don't give the NCAA too much credit yet.
Entering this week, a KenPom-record 136 teams have taken at least 40 percent of their shots this season from beyond the 3-point line. Two years ago, 84 teams had hit that 40 percent mark. Ten years ago, 38 teams hit that mark.
These numbers matter because the positionless basketball wave has impacted college basketball at a rapid rate. And more teams than ever have diversified their strategies to include more shots from beyond the arc.

25960499,"Tennessee has been ranked No. 1 in The Associated Press poll the past three weeks, has one loss this season and owns Division I's longest winning streak.
But it wasn't enough for the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee to give the Volunteers the top overall seed in its initial rankings. The committee revealed its preliminary rankings Saturday and it was Duke, not the Vols, earning the No. 1 overall seed.
The Blue Devils were No. 1 in the East Region and the Vols topped the South, with Virginia in the Midwest and Gonzaga out West earning the other No. 1 seeds.
""They are heading to the East by the slightest of margins,"" committee chairman and Stanford athletic director Bernard Muir said. ""There was a very close conversation between the No. 1 seed and the No. 2 seed, but the strength of schedule won out in Duke's case.""
The Blue Devils crushed the competition last week ahead of a rematch with Virginia. Who's hot on the leaderboard heading into the showdown?
Here's your updated source for all of the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
Duke was slated to play in Washington, D.C., in an East Region that includes Michigan, Marquette and Iowa State. Tennessee tops a South Region in Louisville, Kentucky, with North Carolina, Purdue and Nevada. Virginia led a Midwest Region in Kansas City, Missouri, that also includes Kentucky, Houston and Wisconsin. The West Region in Anaheim, California, had Michigan State, Kansas and Louisville with the Zags.
The initial rankings offered a preview of the committee's thoughts five weeks before Selection Sunday, on March 17. The NCAA ditched the RPI this season for its own ranking system, the NCAA Evaluation Tool, to select teams for the NCAA tournament. The NET relies on game results, strength of schedule, game location, scoring margin, offensive and defensive efficiency and quality of wins and losses.
Duke (21-2, 9-1 ACC after beating Virginia on Saturday) has losses to Gonzaga and Syracuse, but blew out Kentucky in its season opener, knocked off Auburn and Texas Tech and plays in the loaded ACC. Tennessee's only loss was to then-No. 2 Kansas. It has the longest winning streak in school history, with 18 straight victories after beating Florida on Saturday.
The Vols (21-1, 10-0) moved to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 in Week 12 after Duke's loss to Syracuse.
""When I say they're the No. 2 seed, really, in the committee's mind, it was 1A and 1B,"" Muir said.
Muir went on to say defending national champion Villanova was the last team out of the rankings, with Virginia Tech, Texas Tech and LSU also being considered. Kentucky, the top No. 2 seed, was placed in Kansas City instead of playing just down the road in Louisville, so it can't play No. 1 Duke until the Final Four.
Kansas was moved out West for competitive balance in the bracket. Lawrence is about 40 miles from the Sprint Center in Kansas City. Nevada, No. 6 in the AP poll, was the No. 14 overall seed in the initial rankings after opening the season 21-1. The Wolf Pack's loss came at New Mexico on Jan. 5, and Muir said they were close to earning a No. 3 seed.
""We're so happy to be part of today, but we know there's five weeks of basketball to be played and a lot of work to be done by a lot of teams, including ourselves,"" Nevada coach Eric Musselman said. ""We just want to get better in all facets of the game. We have a lot of tough venues on the road. With eight games to play, anything can happen.""
Louisville was placed in Anaheim because the South Region will be played on the Cardinals' home court, giving them an unfair advantage.
"
25948579,"Kansas' quest for a 15th consecutive Big 12 title took another hit Thursday night.
Senior guard Lagerald Vick is taking a leave of absence from the team, effective immediately, the school announced.
""Lagerald has some personal matters that require his immediate attention, and he will be taking a leave of absence from our team,"" coach Bill Self said. ""During this time, we will respect Lagerald's privacy. There is no timetable for his return.""
The player's mother, La La Vick, told the Kansas City Star she wanted him home in Memphis, Tennessee.
""We need him here for a couple weeks,"" La La Vick told The Star. ""I need him. There's a lot going on. It'll work out.""
Vick played a season-low 19 minutes in Kansas' loss at Kansas State on Tuesday, scoring just seven points. The 6-foot-5 guard's scoring performances have trended downward as the season has progressed, after he averaged 24.6 points and made 28 3-pointers during a five-game stretch in November and early December. Since scoring 29 points against Villanova on Dec. 15, Vick has hit the 15-point mark just twice.
On the season, he's averaging 14.1 points and four rebounds and shooting 45.5 percent from 3-point range. In Kansas' six losses, however, Vick's numbers drop to 10 points on 32.4 percent 3-point shooting.
Vick originally was not expected back in Lawrence for his senior season. He declared for the NBA draft following Kansas' Final Four campaign, and Self proceeded as if Vick would not be back with the Jayhawks this season. Vick then withdrew his name from the draft much to the surprise of Self.
""The talk we had at the end of the season would be that he would go somewhere else if he decided to stay in school,"" Self told ESPN in June. ""That was something we talked about; we kind of agreed on that.""
After Self flew to Memphis to meet with Vick and his mother, though, the school announced in late June that Vick was returning to the team.
Kansas is chasing its 15th straight Big 12 regular-season title, but the Jayhawks have dropped into a tie for fourth place after the loss to Kansas State earlier this week. In addition to Vick, Kansas lost center Udoka Azubuike for the season with an injury in early January and has been without sophomore Silvio De Sousa all season because of an NCAA eligibility issue. Marcus Garrett has also missed the past two games with an ankle injury.
The Jayhawks (17-6, 6-4 Big 12) host Oklahoma State on Saturday.

25923528,"""Win or lose, you've got to have amnesia,"" former coach and ESPN college basketball analyst Fran Fraschilla said. ""One close loss, one blowout loss, one great win doesn't define your season. My motto was, 'All we wanna do is start a one-game winning streak.'""
Former coach and ESPN analyst Seth Greenberg -- who recalled a bad loss to Boston College immediately after his Virginia Tech team defeated No. 1 Duke in 2011 -- agreed. ""Especially in league play, you've got to learn from it, obviously, but you have to have a short-term memory because you've got another game in two, three days. Can't harbor on the past.""
NC State would certainly like to move on. According to ESPN Stats & Information, the Wolfpack hadn't scored fewer than 15 points in a half in the past decade (they didn't reach that mark in either half of this loss). They shot 17.3 percent from the field, the worst mark in school history.
But bad losses happen to everyone in basketball, as all our coaches say.
This week, in keeping with the spirit of the annual NBA and College Basketball Crossover on ESPN, NBA analyst P.J. Carlesimo joins Greenberg, Fraschilla and ESPN college hoops analyst Dan Dakich. Carlesimo coached at Wagner for six seasons before taking over at Seton Hall in 1982. He stayed there until he left for the NBA in 1994. He took the Pirates to the 1988-89 title game, in which they lost to Michigan 80-79 in overtime.
Two of ESPN's coach analysts point to a certain Tennessee head coach regarding similar coaching styles.
We asked our coaches to tell us about the technical fouls they remember best. Guess which coach got his 14 seconds into his first game?
Every week, we ask our coaches to tell us something we don't know. This week, a certain Michigan State coach is a popular subject.
Dan Dakich: In 1999, Bowling Green had started 6-1, and we were in the top 30 in the country. We'd beaten Hawaii at Hawaii and won a tournament. Then we went to West Virginia and played a bad WVU team. They didn't have a home court, and they had to play in a civic center in Charleston, and they beat us by 46 freaking points [final score: 100-54]. After the game, I told my players to hurry up and dress and get in the bus before West Virginia came down here to beat the hell out of them again. I used it for fire all season long. We won our last six and won the MAC East outright for the first time since 1983. Two years later, West Virginia hires me as head coach. [Dakich returned to coach Bowling Green eight days after accepting the Mountaineers job.] And during the introductory press conference, the athletic director says, ""Well, we've had our eye on Dan since we played them a few years ago."" And I said, ""Really? You know you beat me by 46 points, and you had your eye on me? What's wrong with you people?""

Seth Greenberg and Dan Dakich give you an all-access pass inside the world of college basketball. Listen now!
Seth Greenberg: My first year at Virginia Tech, we're in the Big East. We travel to Rutgers. Obviously, I'm a New Yorker, so I've got probably 100 people there: family, friends, college roommates, aunts, uncles, high school friends. We come out, score the first bucket, run a counter play, go up 4-nothing, my group's going crazy, and in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, ""You know what? This is pretty good!"" Then Rutgers scores the next 34 points. We get obliterated 85-52. I was so ticked off and mad after the game that we played so poorly that I waited in the locker room and told someone to send my mom home. I waited until everyone was gone, but my college roommate was hiding around the corner. So when I came out, he turns to me and goes, ""Hey, Greeny, you're really good at this coaching thing.""
Fran Fraschilla: In my first year attempting to rebuild St. John's basketball program, our December schedule included games against Michigan, Villanova and a very good Minnesota team that eventually went to the Final Four that year. We played competitively in the first two games, but in our third game, out at Williams Arena, we were beaten 77-39 by Clem Haskins' club. He left his starters in the entire game. It's not something I would have done, but I certainly wasn't mad at him for that; every coach coaches their own team. While I wanted to crawl underneath the stands, all I could think of was, ""We have to get better players."" They clearly had outclassed us that day. Luckily, that kind of loss fueled some competitive fire. We continued to get better in Year 1 and made it back to the NCAA tournament the next year. I don't care if you're Coach K or a young coach starting out in Division I: Everybody has had these experiences, often numerous times. It's part of competition.
Although coach Carlesimo didn't zone in on a single game, he talked about the challenges of turning around a program -- his modus operandi at the collegiate and professional levels -- and how tough it is for coaches to do so nowadays, in an era when quick wins and quick exits seem more common.
P.J. Carlesimo: I remember some bad losses in the NBA: the Denver Nuggets beating us [Seattle SuperSonics] by about 100 points [Denver won by 52] and the Utah Jazz beating us [Portland Trail Blazers] bad in the postseason. But college? I can't think of a specific game because there were so, so many. My first year at Wagner, my first Division I job, we won three games. [Their biggest loss that season was by 34 points to Villanova.] My first year at the Hall, we won six games, then nine the following season. We got drilled a bunch during my first four or five years there. The Big East was so good. The thing that was different about the Big East, though, which started with Dave Gavitt at Providence, was that coaches would go out of their way to not embarrass you -- and we were on the other end of that a lot. I vividly remember nights when teams would make a couple of extra passes, would stop pressing, stop fast-breaking. I coached for a lot of rebuilding programs, and some coaches -- probably smarter than me -- won't take those jobs, and there's nothing wrong with that.
The reason I took Wagner -- aside from it being a Division I job when I was 27 -- is it was a job a lot of people didn't want. Lots of losing seasons in a row in Division III, then the athletic director moved up to Division I. He wanted a young coach out of Division I -- I'd been at Fordham -- who wouldn't mind taking a lot of losses. Some coaches don't want those losses, which is totally fine. Others smarter than me could turn the programs around much quicker. I knew things would take a long time. Same with Seton Hall. It was in the Big East, but the bottom of the Big East, so a lot of people thought it was a bad job. Not a good facility on campus, either, especially compared to other teams in the conference. It's not easy when the losses accumulate or there are big losses. It's almost easier when you lose a close one, so you just change one or two things moving forward. The time and patience help.
Many of my most vivid memories of that 1988-89 Seton Hall team is that the school stayed with us. Virtually every other school would have fired me and my coaching staff. They allowed us to turn it around, even after a long time. That's why that run and success was so enjoyable. I remember thinking this team was good enough to make the Final Four, but it would have been with a different coaching staff. But the school stayed with us and gave us that opportunity to get our record back. Unfortunately, that's less and less the case. It's one of the really negative things that's more commonplace in college sports across the board lately. Totally unrealistic and unfair to coaches.

25902687,"De Sousa, a 6-foot-9 sophomore from Angola and a key reserve in Kansas' run to the Final Four last season, has been held out of competition by the Jayhawks since October, when former Adidas consultant T.J. Gassnola testified in federal court that he paid $2,500 to De Sousa's guardian, Fenny Falmagne.
""In my 30-plus years of coaching college basketball, I have never witnessed such a mean-spirited and vindictive punishment against a young man who did nothing wrong,"" Self said in a statement released shortly after the NCAA announced its ruling. ""To take away his opportunity to play college basketball is shameful and a failure of the NCAA.
""Silvio is a tremendous young man who absolutely deserves to be on the court with his teammates in a Jayhawk uniform. This process took way too long to address these issues. We will support Silvio as he considers his options.""
Former South Carolina and Oklahoma State assistant Lamont Evans has pleaded guilty, admitting to accepting $22,000 in bribes to steer players toward certain financial advisers and managers once they turned pro.
Former Adidas exec James Gatto, Merl Code and Christian Dawkins were found guilty in a pay-for-play scheme involving high-profile basketball recruits of Kansas, Louisville and NC State.
Text messages presented by defense attorneys on Monday indicated the Kansas coaches were at least aware of former Adidas consultant T.J. Gassnola's involvement in the Jayhawks' recruitment of current player Silvio De Sousa, a native of Angola.
In its statement, the NCAA said a student-athlete is responsible for the actions of any third party involved in the recruitment process, regardless of whether the athlete knew of any improprieties or not.
""Membership guidelines state the starting point for these violations is permanent ineligibility, but the NCAA staff recognized mitigation based on the specific circumstances of this case when making its decision,"" the NCAA said in its ruling on De Sousa's eligibility.
The NCAA said De Sousa, who has not played in any games this season, can appeal the decision to the Division I Student-Athlete Reinstatement Committee, which Kansas athletic director Jeff Long said would happen ""immediately.""
""This was clearly an unfair and punitive ruling for a young man who had no knowledge of any NCAA violation, nor did Silvio personally benefit from the violation,"" Long said in a statement. ""While we will continue to work with the NCAA on the broader matter, we have an obligation and a desire to advocate for our student-athletes, and will continue to do that for an outstanding young man.""
De Sousa's attorney, Scott Tompsett, called the decision ""outrageous.""
""It should shock the conscience of anyone who believes in fundamental fairness,"" Tompsett said. ""Silvio did absolutely nothing wrong. He was not involved in any wrongdoing by the adults, he did not know about any wrongdoing by the adults, and he did not benefit from any wrongdoing by the adults.
""... Let me be very clear: Silvio never received any illicit money from anyone. The NCAA's decision illustrates the absurdity of how the NCAA enforces its rules: A young man who did nothing wrong has had his life altered in a very negative way through no fault of his own. That is not how we do things in this country.""
De Sousa graduated early from IMG Academy in December 2017 and enrolled at Kansas for the spring semester last season. He made his debut Jan. 13, 2018, and appeared in 20 games for the Jayhawks.
Earlier this month, Tompsett demanded the NCAA reinstate his client, saying De Sousa has cooperated fully with the investigation and shouldn't be held responsible for the ""illicit"" actions of adults.
""Silvio came to the United States from Angola at the age of 15, and he did everything he was supposed to do and was asked to do to become an eligible student-athlete at the University of Kansas,"" Tompsett said. ""Silvio followed the rules. He did nothing wrong.""
Gassnola was accused of conspiring with Adidas director of global sports marketing for basketball James Gatto, who was found guilty in October on felony charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

25933062,"MANHATTAN, Kan. -- Sure as the celebration launched by the rush of humanity that flooded the court as the seconds ticked away on Kansas State's 74-67 win over Kansas on Tuesday, the Jayhawks' remarkable streak of Big 12 dominance is in danger.
This sixth KU loss in seven true road games felt different than the others, different than the rout at the hands of Iowa State and the late lead inexplicably blown at West Virginia.
It felt different because Kansas can always -- well, almost always -- count on righting its wrongs against rival K-State. Not on this night, which marked the first win by Kansas State over KU in nearly four years and just its fifth over the Jayhawks in 31 games at Bramlage Coliseum.
These Wildcats have hit their stride since the return of senior forward Dean Wade, the preseason Big 12 player of the year who missed six games in December and January with a foot injury.
His absence turned K-State into a dark horse. But you might remember that coach Bruce Weber's team danced within one win of the Final Four a year ago and began this season as the most real threat to dethrone Kansas in the league.
With five weeks to go, well, here they are -- alone atop the Big 12 standings at 7-2 as Baylor visits Texas on Wednesday with a chance to match K-State's mark. Iowa State is lurking, too, one back of the Wildcats in the loss column.
No. 13 Kansas, meanwhile, sits tied for fourth with Texas Tech at 6-4. Fourth place after 14 straight regular-season Big 12 titles. The last time the Jayhawks won fewer than seven of their first 10 league games? It was 25 years ago in the Big Eight.
KU has real concerns that extend beyond its conference record and the scoreboard in Manhattan. The Jayhawks remain without big men Udoka Azubuike, out for the season, and Silvio De Sousa, suspended for all of this year and next.
Veteran guard Marcus Garrett did not play Tuesday because of an ankle injury. Lagerald Vick logged just four minutes in the first half and did not start the second half because of an undisclosed concern.
As a result, a 15th straight Big 12 championship ought to rank down the list of Kansas' priorities.
""We ain't even worried about that,"" forward Dedric Lawson said. ""We're just worried about getting better.""
Good idea, coach Bill Self said. Despite the temptation to consider scenarios ahead of K-State's Feb. 25 visit to Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks are better off staying focused on their own issues, according to Self.
Here's your updated source for all of the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
""We shouldn't even be concerned about the damn race right now,"" he said.
""Are we in a great position to win the league? No. Do we deserve to be in a great position? Absolutely not. Can we flip the switch? It remains to be seen.""
Kansas possesses the skill, with Lawson and Vick as major scoring threats. Freshman Devon Dotson sparkled at times Tuesday, while fellow rookies Quentin Grimes and Ochai Agbaji struggled in their Sunflower Showdown debuts.
The Jayhawks committed 23 turnovers, prompting Self to describe the performance as ""one of the worst days of offensive execution"" that he could recall.
""It's leadership. It's toughness. It's inexperience,"" the coach said.
Mental toughness and physical toughness.
""This team doesn't have much of it right now,"" Self said.
""Our young kids have never been in a situation like that. They ate us up pretty good. We were never, ever remotely comfortable. And that's a credit to them.""
Yes, credit Kansas State. With Wade, senior guard Barry Brown and sophomore Cartier Diarra, whose windmill dunk in the final minute nearly blew the roof off Bramlage, Kansas State isn't going away.
""We could have come over here and played great tonight and still lost,"" Self said. ""They've got a really good team.""
After Baylor goes to Texas, Kansas State is the only Big 12 contender with five league road games remaining -- starting Saturday at Baylor. The Bears also must still travel to Lawrence.
""To me, the most important thing, we're in first place,"" Weber said. ""Long way to go. I hope it's not finished.""
Kansas State surely doesn't look finished. As for the Kansas streak, as Self said, it remains to be seen.

Adams, averaging 17 points per game, was injured just under six minutes into the game when Temple's J.P. Moorman II fell on Adams' leg during a scramble near the basket. Adams had to be helped to the locker room by a teammate.

25971936,"Another wild week calls for another round of What's Real and What's Fake in college basketball:
Tony Bennett's team put together an exemplary effort against Duke on Saturday in its 81-71 loss. The highlights (Duke's 61 percent clip from the 3-point line, Zion Williamson's wild block) rightfully led to additional adoration for a Blue Devils team that looks the part of a national champion.
But Virginia's strategy limited Duke's opportunities around the rim. The Cavaliers forced turnovers on nearly one-fourth of Duke's possessions. Duke might be the only team in the country that would have left Charlottesville with a win and a 54 percent success rate inside the arc on Saturday night.
Bennett probably wants no part of a third game with Duke in the ACC tournament or a rematch in the Final Four -- both possibilities -- but who else could foil this Virginia squad that did everything in its power to force Duke, which entered the game shooting under 31 percent from beyond the arc, to live on the perimeter for an entire game?
Had Duke produced a 3-point clip closer to its average -- let's say, 7-for-21 -- Virginia might have won by 10.
Tre Jones struggled to advance the ball past midcourt in the first half against Kihei Clark's pressure. Virginia robbed the Blue Devils of driving lanes and forced their stars to take difficult shots.
Virginia sustained its defensive pressure throughout the game, but a great Duke team got hot and neutralized the Cavs. Still, anyone who watched Bennett's squad play effective basketball on every possession knows how imposing this Virginia squad could be in March.
Whenever a new coach takes over a struggling program, he usually makes immediate changes aimed at eradicating the problems that led to his predecessor's dismissal. But it takes time. And Tom Crean, Georgia's first-year head coach, has apparently run out of patience with his group.
After his team's 16-point home loss to Ole Miss on Saturday, Crean said he blamed himself ""because I'm the one who decided to keep these guys."" Um ...OK?
He added: ""It doesn't mean that they are not great kids, but very few programs when there's a takeover, when you have guys that haven't done it at any point in time really in their career, a lot of those guys, they move on. That's what happens in a job change. And I didn't do that. So I'm not going to complain. We've just got to keep doing everything we can do to fix it and make it better.""
Georgia is 1-9 in the SEC. That's why Crean worked hard to land Anthony Edwards, the No. 5 recruit in the country per ESPN.com, and other elite prospects. But the idea that his team would have been better off if he'd kicked guys off the team when he took the job is a preposterous in-season statement.
Yes, coaches often remove players or encourage those that don't fit their culture to transfer when they take new jobs. But they usually don't demean the ones who remain because it's counterproductive. It's also a knock against former Georgia coach Mark Fox. And it's not like Crean left Archie Miller an abundance of talent at Indiana.
Crean is basically saying, ""You all stink and I should have booted you when I had the chance."" What a bizarre statement to make. He's bashing young men whose only sin was staying with this team.
The NBA teams that covet Zion Williamson not only want him for his unique skill set, but they're also aware of the frenzy around him and the potential to monetize it at the next level. The atmosphere Williamson generated during Duke's win over Virginia in Charlottesville is a significant element of his appeal.
Before the game, hundreds of fans lined the sidewalks as they waited to spill into the arena. Hours earlier, Cavaliers fans rose early to attend College GameDay.
The Blue Devils' pressure defense helped them rally from a 23-point second-half deficit.
Here's your updated source for all the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
New Georgia Bulldogs commit Anthony Edwards is only 17, but his skills invite comparisons to multiple NBA standouts.
A local hotel manager fielded calls from fans seeking to fill the handful of rooms available near the arena. Per Chris Leyden of SeatGeek.com, tickets were reselling for an average of $300 on the secondary market, a nearly 200 percent increase from Virginia's average home ticket price.
LeBron James, Rajon Rondo and Rich Paul were all there. Grant Hill, Ralph Sampson Jr. and ESPN's Michael Wilbon were, too. From start to finish, it was the loudest venue I've been to this season.
That Hollywood-like element is an underrated component of Williamson's appeal. No other player in the country can do what he did on Saturday night. The environment that he and his Duke teammates create when they hit the road is the reason NBA teams will do everything they can to secure his services.
We don't know whether Williamson will enjoy a dominant run in the NBA. But the arenas will look, feel and sound like John Paul Jones Arena did on Saturday night wherever he plays next year.
The matchup between Kentucky and Tennessee on Saturday in Lexington will feature some of the most talented players in the country: Grant Williams, Admiral Schofield, PJ Washington, Reid Travis and Keldon Johnson.
Several of those players will be All-Americans at the end of the season. Yep, the depth of both squads could prove to be the most important element of Saturday's game.
Since a loss to Alabama on Jan. 5, Tyler Herro has made 39 percent of his 3-point attempts. And EJ Montgomery and Nick Richards will give Kentucky reinforcements off the bench. Tennessee's John Fulkerson and Derrick Walker have to be ready to contribute, too.
Jordan Bone is averaging 14.5 PPG (50 percent from the 3-point line) over his past four games. He's also committed 16 turnovers in his past five outings, and Ashton Hagans is one of America's best defenders. Losing Yves Pons to a facial injury that could sideline him on Saturday is a problem for the Vols.
This is a rich matchup where the depth of two premier programs will be tested.
This season is stacked with national coach of the year candidates. Some -- Rick Barnes, Mark Few and John Beilein -- have been on the list all season.
But others have emerged in recent weeks. Matt Painter is doing some of his best work with a Purdue team that hasn't lost since Jan. 8. Chris Mack inherited a program that lost four starters, yet Louisville was listed as a top-four seed in the NCAA's initial pairings on Saturday.
Kelvin Sampson's Houston squad might enter the NCAA tournament with one loss.
This season's pool has a multitude of deserving candidates.

""We feel terrible for Killian,"" head coach Mark Few said in a statement. ""He is an incredible teammate and an absolute joy to coach. Killian is a tough kid. We are hopeful treatment will go well and get him back for the postseason.""
Tillie, a 6-foot-10 junior from France, missed the first 15 games of the season with an ankle injury and was still working his way back into the lineup. He was averaging 6.0 points and 4.2 rebounds in nine games this season but was one of the best players in the West Coast Conference last season.
When he was fully healthy a year ago, Tillie put up 12.9 points and 5.9 rebounds, while shooting 47.9 percent from 3-point range and establishing himself as one of the more versatile defensive players in the country.
With Tillie out, Gonzaga's frontcourt depth behind Rui Hachimura and Brandon Clarke will fall to senior Jeremy Jones and freshman Filip Petrusev, whose role has diminished considerably since Tillie returned to the fold.

25953759,"Less than a year removed from their 21-point throttling of Arizona in the NCAA tournament and a school-record 27-win season, and just weeks after the school's first win against Syracuse since 1963 (in the Carrier Dome, to boot) this is the new normal for the Buffalo Bulls.
The man at the forefront of it all is Nate Oats, a spry 44-year-old former high school math teacher who was coaching hoops at Romulus High School in greater Detroit less than six years ago. He's risen quickly behind the firm belief that the players come first, and on a style predicated on trust.
""We did a culture playbook two summers ago and our three main beliefs -- core values, we call them -- are max effort, continuous growth and selfless love,"" Oats said. He has expanded on the playbook by adding a blue-collar element to his program that reflects Buffalo itself -- a city with a rich history hit hard by various industrial changes, but with continued economic growth -- and a friendly, hardworking attitude.
During games, the staff charts what it calls blue-collar points -- deflections, hustle plays, charges -- any type of winning play that doesn't register in the box score. The player with the most points earns a construction helmet after the game.
""It gives us a visual representation of how we should conduct ourselves and how we should think out there on the court,"" says senior guard CJ Massinburg, a first-team All-MAC performer who tallied 43 points in an upset road win (Buffalo was an 11-point underdog) over West Virginia and who has received the award multiple times.
""We do whatever we can to make the players feel special,"" Oats told ESPN, ""but in return we're gonna demand a lot out of them. I think we've done a really good job building relationships with guys.""
After grinding it out as a successful Division III player at tiny Maranatha Baptist University in his hometown of Watertown, Wisconsin, Oats sought out coaching as a means to stay involved in the game he loved most. A quick search of his office reveals a slew of old coaching manuals -- tomes by Bob Huggins, Rick Majerus, Del Harris, Hubie Brown and Coach K are all favorites -- as well as a tediously organized drawer of old playbooks and notes.
""I love basketball. But I knew I wasn't gonna play for money,"" Oats said.
Oats -- whose Romulus teams were consistently ranked nationally and captured their first state title in nearly three decades under his guidance -- quickly built up equity among the Buffalo players as an assistant under Bobby Hurley. When Hurley accepted an offer to become the head coach at Arizona State nearly four years ago, Oats knew it was a tall order to expect the head-coaching position at UB, given his unconventional route up the coaching ladder.
But then-athletic director Danny White interviewed the players, and every single one of them advocated for Oats to get the job.
""What stood out is the connections [Nate] had with our players,"" White said. ""His reputation as a high school coach -- most people I asked said he ran it like a Division I college program. Players had a strong relationship with him.""
The positive sentiments were also echoed by Hurley, who informed White that his young assistant had already taken on a considerable coaching load in addition to building a strong rapport with the roster. And, if White didn't promote him, Hurley would surely retain his services in Tempe.
""I had a spot for Nate [at Arizona State] and I never gave that a second thought,"" Hurley said.
""I knew how passionate he was how and how hardworking he was. He was getting a lot out of our players. He's a really good recruiter. ... He invests building relationships with the guys.""
Additionally, Oats preaches a suffocating brand of both individual and team defense, along with a complex offensive playbook full of NBA sets and built-in counters. The Bulls are one of the few teams in college basketball to rank in the top 30 of both offensive and defensive efficiency, per KenPom.
""We don't care who we're playing -- we're gonna come out and be the aggressors,"" he said. ""As long as you play hard and you give us max effort with a great attitude, I'm going to let you play through slumps.""
Such a philosophy also manifests itself in recruiting, where the mission for Oats and his staff is not necessarily to get the highest-rated prospects, but the ones who best fit the program. Massinburg, for example, was a virtually unrecruited guard from Dallas with one Division I offer, from Prairie View A&M. Oats initially anticipated he would redshirt, but Massinburg worked his way into the rotation early, broke out with a 17-point effort at Duke, and never looked back. Massinburg -- who has a chance to become the school's all-time leading scorer -- has since become an indispensable member of the team and a perfect representation of that Buffalo blue-collar work ethic.
This season's freshman class, meanwhile, features Jeenathan Williams, a four-star recruit and the school's highest-ranked prospect ever to sign out of high school. The Bulls also inked Instagram sensation Ronaldo Segu, an electric point guard the staff has high hopes for and affectionately deems ""Rondo.""
""There are so many mistakes made in recruiting,"" Oats said. ""You don't have to get guys ranked in the top 100. ... We compete at everything. Even walk-throughs, shootarounds. Some kids that's not for them. What we really want, is talented, good-character kids. I want competitive kids.""
Competition even expanded into the summer, when the Bulls' coaching staff organized a four-day team retreat, in an effort to build camaraderie and trust, that omitted phones and included hill-running as well as players holding the same rope to climb a mountain.
Few players personify the significance of trust more than senior guard Dontay Caruthers -- a former MAC Defensive Player of the Year -- who leads the Bulls with a 44 percent clip from deep. Caruthers has been in the Buffalo program for three years.
""I didn't like school,"" he said. ""I love it now."" Caruthers is currently pursuing his master's degree in educational studies.
""I've been able to find my confidence thanks to him [Oats] and my teammates. I don't think any other coach would do that,"" Caruthers said.
Hurley says it's Oats' experience at inner-city Romulus that helps him connect with players.
""He worked with kids that didn't come from ideal backgrounds all the time,"" Hurley said. ""We have to be able to relate to our players and understand their struggles and their lives away from basketball.""
Confidence was forged throughout last season, when the Bulls felt they were really on the cusp of something special -- even if Oats wasn't always so sure.
""Here's what we said,"" he recalled. ""The first time that we play a high major on a neutral floor with our entire roster is gonna be in the NCAA tournament, and we're gonna beat 'em. That's what we said all year. Then we get to Sunday night. Arizona comes up as a 4-seed and you're like, 'Man, they got screwed.' They should have been at least a 3-seed, maybe even a 2. And then your name comes up two seconds later [a 13-seed].
""I thought we deserved an 11 or a 12. I wasn't excited, but I couldn't let the players see. You get back to the office later that night after the watch party and then you start studying the film. I actually convinced myself -- which you have to do, and then convince the players -- that this was a great matchup.""
The Wildcats had momentum and Deandre Ayton, the eventual No. 1 pick in the 2018 NBA draft. But the Bulls had both the experience and the belief that they were the better team.
And they were right. The Bulls won 89-68.
Success generates exposure to new situations and first-class problems. After his team knocked off Arizona, Oats provided bulletin board material for coach John Calipari and Kentucky, Buffalo's second-round opponent.
""I'm maybe too honest, too naive, too stupid, haven't dealt with media enough,"" Oats said. ""I made a comment before the Kentucky game. Basically a high school coach of mine had sent me a text, 'Cal's been whining about his youth.' So I said the same word [whining, to the media]; I should have just said Cal's been commenting about his lack of experience.""
Kentucky knocked off the Bulls 95-75.
""Lesson learned,"" Oats said. ""But I'm gonna say what I gotta say.""
""It left a bitter taste in our mouths,"" Massinburg said. ""We came into this year with the confidence we had last year.""
Success and confidence also amounts to expectations, to which Oats says: ""I don't want our guys thinking 'Final Four or bust.' Our thing was, let's talk about what our ceiling can be, and then let's be peaking at the end of the year.""
Today, the elephant in the room is whether or not Oats will look to climb the coaching ranks and join a Power 5 program with a larger budget and the bells and whistles to match.
""That's the question of the year right now,"" Oats acknowledged. But it's a question shaped by more than basketball.
More than three years ago, Oats and his wife, Crystal, discovered that she had a rare form of cancer called double-hit lymphoma. Oats' coaching career immediately became secondary.
The family was able to lean on the school's medical program to connect with a new doctor and begin treatment.
""I walked in and said, 'What are we gonna do? If I need to step away for however much time it takes, that's what I'll do.' Right away she says, 'No, no, no, you're not doing that. This is your dream. We can get through this. You're gonna coach this team,'"" Oats said. ""And the entire community of Buffalo just embraced our family through the whole thing.""
Crystal's cancer is now in remission.
""We love it here,"" Oats said of Buffalo. ""Ideally we don't leave; we've built something special here and want to continue developing it. There may be a job out there somewhere that would be hard to say no to -- I don't know what that would be, though. Any decisions we would make would be what is best for our family. And Buffalo has shown our family amazing support in many areas and we're confident they'll continue to support us here. We've got a good feeling they're gonna make it really hard to leave, and hopefully we stay here for a long time.""
The school does not want its bright young leader to leave either, especially after rewarding him with a salary raise to $600,000. It makes Oats the second-highest-paid coach in the MAC.
The mood at shootaround is light but focused. Associate head coach Jim Whitesell, a 35-year veteran of coaching, runs much of the Ball State scouting, walking through everything from specific sets to player tendencies and out-of-bounds specials. The top priority is for the scout team to properly execute the Ball State offense, which will provide a basis of what to expect in the game.
""Let's do diamond formation,"" Whitesell says, wanting to simulate one of the Cardinals' offensive sets. But things go awry and the intensity level drops momentarily.
""Run it again,"" Whitesell demands. ""Obviously we're not doing it right. Pay attention, pay attention. Offense, I need you guys to run their s---!""
""You gotta go with more pace, A.J.,"" he instructs redshirt guard Antwain Johnson, a Middle Tennessee transfer who will be eligible next season.

""Hands, hands, hands!"" Whitesell tells his defense.
""Can we try a game with zero moving screens?"" Oats implores his team. ""Let's try to get our turnovers back in single digits by eliminating stupid moving screens. ... If you pass up an open shot that ends up in a turnover, you're coming out of the game. I'm tired of passing up open shots. It's stupid.""
(In the game that night, Segu would pass up a wide-open 3 and subsequently turn the ball over, to which Oats yelled, ""Shoot the ball!"")
One constant to any Bulls practice is competition. It represents the fabric of everything they hope to accomplish. To conclude shootaround, the team must make 80 3-pointers in five minutes -- the caveat being that if you miss two in a row, you then have to make 10 at the other end of the floor to get back into the drill. In a vacuum, everything is a competition because that is precisely how you learn to win.
About 20 minutes before tipoff, the Bulls head back to their locker room for a visualization exercise conducted by Arnie Guin, the team's mental skills coach. Perhaps no message hits home more than a Bill Russell quote he asks the guys to consider: ""Concentration and mental toughness are the margin of victory.""
Assistant coach Bryan Hodgson, who has been instrumental in anchoring the Bulls' impressive recruiting efforts, shares his thoughts with the guards, who have a tough assignment defending second-team all-conference shooting guard Tayler Persons: ""Pressure him, but be solid. Don't need to reach, we've known that. You guys have guarded the s--- out of him for two years.""
True to form, Buffalo races out to a 7-0 lead behind suffocating defense. Despite an 0-3 shooting start, senior forward Jeremy Harris makes three successive winning plays -- two offensive boards and a pass that leads to free throw attempts.
More than halfway through the first half, Ball State has as many points (six) as it does turnovers. The only problem: Buffalo can't seem to find any sort of offensive rhythm either. One of the most lethal transition attacks in the country continually comes up empty-handed in the open floor and so too does the Bulls' normally well-oiled half-court offense.
""That was the worst half of offensive basketball I've ever seen,"" Oats tells his staff before speaking with his team at intermission. Even with the offense sputtering, though, this remains the type of gritty, blue-collar game Oats wants -- a formula he believes will serve his team well in a single-elimination tournament setting. Physicality, defense and toughness often prevail, even when you can't throw it in the ocean.
""Quit avoiding contact. Get your butt to the free throw line,"" Oats tells his team before tipoff. ""Soft teams can't win in March.""
Ultimately, though, the Bulls prove to be anything but soft, prevailing with an 83-59 win while holding Ball State to a woeful 32 percent from the floor on 2-23 (8.7 percent) from 3, while turning the Cardinals over 18 times. Persons -- who averages 17 PPG -- is held to just six points on 2-of-12 shooting, one of the worst games of his career.
These days, there is a familiar sight at Bulls games for Oats, one which brings tremendous comfort. With Crystal's cancer in remission, she and their three daughters regularly attend games, even on the road. In the wake of Crystal's battle for her life, Oats now sees both basketball and life through a different, more balanced lens.
""When you go through cancer, there's a lot that's changed about me since three years ago,"" he said. ""It puts everything in perspective. ... At the end of the day, there's no pressure. You're putting a ball through a ring. So I do think it's made me a better coach.
""There's stuff that you get as a teacher -- dealing with kids on an everyday basis -- that you don't get as an assistant. I taught these kids in class, but I taught their girlfriends. I had interactions with 150 kids a day for 11 years. There's all kinds of stuff that now I can relate better to. ... The unconventional route to where I've got, I wouldn't trade how I got here for anything.""

25907973,"DURHAM, N.C. -- As the ""Quit Tryin', Draft Zion"" bandwagon builds steam in the NBA, Duke superstar freshman Zion Williamson said he's just enjoying his ride in college.
The mighty Zion Williamson (naturally) is No. 1. But the burgeoning phenomenon that is Ja Morant isn't far behind.
The Blue Devils have been on a roll, so how do they rate in Week 2 of our not-too-serious rankings?
Williamson, who scored 29 points in the No. 2 Blue Devils' 91-61 win over St. John's on Saturday, said he can't help but imagine what the future holds, but he's in no rush to make it a reality.
""You do think about it, but this is the only time I get to experience college,"" Williamson said. ""And even if I could've went straight from high school [to the NBA], I would've come to college. I feel like college is something I couldn't miss out on.""
Williamson's performance -- Saturday was his 10th game with 25 or more points this season, the most ever by a Duke freshman -- has earned rave reviews from scouts, while his highlight-reel dunks made him a household name even before he arrived on Duke's campus.
The combination of skill and celebrity has made him unique, even in a sport with its share of talented one-and-done players dealing with a layover in college.
""The world has changed in the last couple years, and nobody brought in the exposure that he's brought in,"" coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ""He had a million, two million followers [on social media] before he ever got here. When's that happen? But it's happening for him. And we're so high profile, that everything is scrutinized. And his play is looked at by everybody. The thing about that kid is, he doesn't want all that attention, and he handles it so well.""

Williamson was alerted after Saturday's game to a New York newspaper back page, which featured an edited image of stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, along with himself, in Knicks jerseys, and even he couldn't help but smile about the potential.
""I mean, it would be dope to play with KD and Kyrie, but whichever team drafts me, I'll be ready to play hard and work,"" he said.
Williamson said he's appreciative of fans who are eager to see him play for their favorite NBA team, but he's reiterated numerous times that his time at Duke is something he cherishes.
Williamson's teammate, RJ Barrett, is also considered a top NBA draft pick, and he largely echoed the comments.
""I try to stay where I'm at and be in the moment, enjoy winning with my brothers,"" said Barrett, who claims he doesn't watch TV and hasn't followed any of the NBA draft talk. ""When the season's over, I'll think of everything else.""

25938262,"Louisville officials ruled Bowen, a five-star recruit from Saginaw, Michigan, ineligible after an FBI investigation uncovered that an Adidas employee and others conspired to pay his father $100,000 for him to sign with the Cardinals.
After Bowen transferred to South Carolina, the NCAA ruled him ineligible for the 2018-19 season. Bowen, 20, never played a game in college and is playing professionally in Australia.
Here's how watching VCU at George Washington on Wednesday on ESPN+ will help you build your bracket.
The late-season top 20 for both the men's and women's Wooden Award was announced on Monday night, with Duke's Zion Williamson and Oregon's Sabrina Ionescu leading the way.
In November 2018, Bowen sued Adidas, Adidas employees Chris Rivers and James Gatto, former Adidas consultants Merl Code and Thomas ""T.J."" Gassnola, former NBA runner Christian Dawkins and financial manager Munish Sood, alleging they violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act by engaging in bribery, fraud and money laundering at the expense of his eligibility and athletic development.
""Bowen purports to decry the state of amateur basketball in this country, but through the actions of his father over many years, Bowen was an active participant in and beneficiary of endemic recruiting violations,"" Adidas lawyers wrote in a motion filed in U.S. District Court in South Carolina on Wednesday.
""The Complaint is a cynical attempt to recover indirect damages from his father's alleged co-conspirators for speculative injuries that he has not suffered and which he may never incur. Even crediting Bowen's declarations of innocence -- which the court must at this stage -- a careful analysis of the Complaint's allegations show that it fails to state a claim under RICO and must be dismissed.""
Brian Bowen Sr., a former police officer, testified in federal court in October that he received thousands of dollars from Gassnola, Dawkins and Rivers for his son to play for Adidas-affiliated grassroots programs. Sood also testified that Bowen Sr. received $19,400 in cash as the first of four payments for Bowen II to attend Louisville.
Bowen Sr. also testified that a handful of colleges, including Arizona, Creighton, Oklahoma State and Texas, offered him tens of thousands of dollars in cash and other improper benefits for his son to play basketball at those schools.
Bowen II has maintained that he was unaware of his father's schemes.
Gatto, Code and Dawkins were convicted of felony charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in October's trial; Sood and Gassnola testified after reaching plea deals with federal prosecutors.
Rivers hasn't been charged in any of the cases.
""The injuries Bowen alleges, such as losing the experience of playing collegiate basketball or reduced future earnings on a hypothetical contract to play in the National Basketball Association, are almost entirely speculative expectation damages or intangible harms that cannot be collected under RICO,"" Adidas' lawyers wrote in the complaint.
""The lone exception is Bowen's purported lost scholarship at UofL. ... UofL's statement demonstrates that Bowen retained his scholarship even after being withheld from playing basketball and voluntarily relinquished it when he decided to leave UofL.""

Seth Greenberg and Dan Dakich give you an all-access pass inside the world of college basketball. Listen now!
And you, in the stands, or on your couch, shouting a few things, depending on your late-game philosophy:
""Foul him!""
Or ...
""Defense!""
Oh, those nerve-wracking final seconds. They're when a coach's ego and philosophy come out; when we see if the team has practiced and is confident enough to execute its late-game doctrine.
""This is the time of year where coaches must really sharpen their special-situation plays,"" coach Fran Fraschilla said, ""because at the end of a conference race, in the conference tournament, or in the NCAA tournament, one seemingly minor play could make the difference in your season.""
""Most guys develop a philosophy that fits their personnel and the competition they play and practice it and live with it,"" coach Seth Greenberg said.
Coach Dan Dakich pointed to a fouling trend: ""The sport's trending where teams foul more, because more teams shoot the ball better from more spots. More stretch-4s, stretch-5s. It used to be just guarding one or two guys close, and you take your chances with a guy who's maybe a 20, 25 percent 3-point shooter. Every game is different, and it depends on how much you practice, but I think more teams are fouling simply because more guys can shoot it better.""
We turned to our coaches to give us a breakdown of their own coaching philosophies.
Fran Fraschilla: ""My philosophy has evolved through the years -- mainly because of my role as a TV analyst here at ESPN, having watched so many games, and so many of those situations. When I was a young coach, I wanted my team to be smart and tough, and so we were not going to foul up three, but instead have that 'macho' approach and say: 'They're not hitting a 3 on our defense.' But as I've seen situations and recognize that the analytics may lend themselves to fouling being the smart play, I've adjusted my thought process.
I'd foul with five seconds or less because if you foul earlier, you give the other team a chance to foul you again, and gain an extra possession. So if you foul with 11 seconds to go, they make their free throws, and they foul you with eight seconds, we're right back in the same situation. So we're fouling five seconds or less. Either way is never 100 percent the right way. Whatever you decide: practice -- and this is the time of year to sharpen it.""
A good NC State team made headlines by scoring 24 points last week. We asked the coaches to recall nightmarish games of their own.
Two of ESPN's coach analysts point to a certain Tennessee head coach regarding similar coaching styles.
We asked our coaches to tell us about the technical fouls they remember best. Guess which coach got his 14 seconds into his first game?
Dan Dakich: ""In my world, I never really fouled: I wanted to play defense. That's changed -- I'd foul now. If there are eight seconds left, I'd make sure they dribble a few times, then with five seconds -- always five seconds -- I'd foul.
It happened that one time it cost us not going to the NCAA tournament. We'd won the MAC. We were up by three, playing Miami (Ohio); there was 16 seconds to go, and my thought was: 'All right. Too much time. We hadn't practiced it with that much time.' I had a pretty good defensive team, so we played great defense -- then Miami attempted a 2 with about six seconds to go. I thought, 'That's great!' But I'll never forget it -- my point guard didn't block out the guy who shot it, who then got it back, threw it to a kid standing somewhere between the top of the key and half court and he drilled a 3. It ended up going to overtime, and they beat us. At that time, I said I wouldn't foul, but after watching it and seeing so many teams come back, I think I would foul now.""
Seth Greenberg: ""When you're up three, you want to defend the full court, turn the ball handler, support with the inbounder, and any time you just count a second to dribble, so basically once you get under five seconds, I'm comfortable giving a foul. You must practice it, because if you don't, guys are so good at playing through the contact that it becomes a factor. But there is so much more that comes into it: if you're not a good free throw block-out team, if you're undersized -- let's say you're playing North Carolina. They're very good at back-tapping a missed free throw and getting an extra possession.
I lost a game to Tyler Hansbrough in the ACC tournament in a free throw situation. This wasn't the exact scenario, but there, we were up by one -- they missed a free throw, they back-tapped, and Hansbrough got the ball and scored on a jumper -- started running around like a gecko. The size of your frontcourt matters.
We lost a very tough game to Tulane with a chance to win a half of the C-USA championship when I was at South Florida on a half-court 3; and that famous shot obviously to Duke that lost us a game, that was the chance to give the foul. All decisions you make in a split-second. Hopefully you've practiced them.""

25909441,"During a brief news conference before the Kansas-Texas Tech game, Long said the school had provided the NCAA with all documents or information requested, and had held De Sousa out of competition in good faith all season.
""I have always respected the NCAA and trusted the process, but I must tell you that my faith has been shaken,"" Long said. ""We stand behind our student-athletes when we believe they've been wronged.""
At issue is not whether De Sousa's guardian, Fenny Falmagne, accepted a $2,500 payment from former Adidas consultant T.J. Gassnola to steer the prospect to Kansas. Rather, it's whether De Sousa, a native of Angola, had any knowledge of the pay-for-play scheme or benefited from it in any way.
De Sousa's name came up during Gassnola's testimony last summer amid the FBI's corruption probe into college basketball. Gassnola acknowledged making the payment to Falmagne, but he steadfastly denied coach Bill Self or anybody associated with Kansas knew of it.
Still, Long said the NCAA would consider De Sousa's reinstatement only under two conditions: The school had to declare him ineligible, which it did Jan. 13, and Kansas had to identify Gassnola as an agent or booster of its program ""only as a hypothetical for the purposes of reinstatement.""
""We disagreed on Gassnola's role in all of it,"" Long said.
But with no other alternatives, Long said Kansas agreed to the conditions and began the reinstatement process. That dragged on for three weeks before the NCAA handed down its punishment.
Kansas responded with a swift statement late Friday in which it vowed to challenge the decision.
""I do feel our university will do whatever they humanly can to create a situation to put our best foot forward to get that penalty reduced, without question,"" Self said Saturday. ""I know that Jeff and our chancellor are on board with fighting for [De Sousa] -- not that you wouldn't fight for every student-athlete, you should. But this one is a little more special the way he's handled everything so far.""
Self said that De Sousa has remained upbeat throughout the uncertainty, and he has remained a key part of Jayhawks practice. He will still be allowed to practice with the team and, assuming the NCAA grants him a waiver, will be allowed to accompany the team on road trips the rest of the season.
""Nothing really surprises me based on recent things we've read about other institutions,"" Self said, ""but I would say that I don't think it's time for us to move on. I don't think we go into this planning on having him -- we prepare like we don't, and if we ever get him it would be a bonus. But regardless of the situation, we have to and should and want to fight and advocate for him.""
Texas Tech coach Chris Beard was much more succinct.
""The NCAA does what they do,"" Beard said after his No. 16 Red Raiders were routed by the 11th-ranked Jayhawks 79-63, ""stuff that makes no sense.""

25961918,"In a series of statements released Friday through her attorney, Meredith Watson said a former Duke basketball player raped her in 1999. Watson also has said that Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax sexually assaulted her on Duke's campus in Durham, North Carolina, when they were both students in 2000.
The identity of the men's basketball player facing the allegation is not known.
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said both he and the university understand the severity of the matter.
""I think there was an allegation made, right?"" Krzyzewski said after Saturday night's victory at Virginia. ""So, I'm not sure that's true or not, but there's an allegation. I didn't find out about it until late last night, and I have no knowledge about it. ... Our university will take care of whatever actions and give whatever information that's needed to be done. I think our [athletic director] has put out a statement that we'll give to you. It's very ... something like that is serious. So, our school looks at it that way, and we'll do whatever we can to make sure that we answer whatever questions are posed to us.""
Duke distributed a statement after the Virginia game, detailing its intent to investigate the claims.
""Duke first learned of the allegations involving a student-athlete last night when they were reported by the media,"" the statement said. ""Coach Krzyzewski confirms that he had no knowledge of the alleged conduct from 1999. The university is looking into the matter and will have no further comment at this time.""
The 1998-99 Duke team was one of the most talented and highly touted teams in school history. It lost to UConn in the national title game that season.
""Ms. Watson was raped by a basketball player during her sophomore year at Duke,"" a portion of Watson's statement read. ""She went to the Dean, who provided no help and discouraged her from pursuing the claim further. Ms. Watson also told friends, including Justin Fairfax.""
Watson is the second woman to allege that Fairfax sexually assaulted her. Fairfax has been urged by leaders to step down.
The allegations against Fairfax are attached to one of the most turbulent weeks in the history of Virginia politics. Gov. Ralph Northam admitted to wearing blackface after a racially incendiary photo in his medical school yearbook surfaced. The state's attorney general, Mark Herring, also has admitted to donning blackface in the past.
Northam has refused to step down, despite demands from his peers and adversaries who want him to leave his post.
Fairfax was expected to succeed Northam if he had decided to step down.
