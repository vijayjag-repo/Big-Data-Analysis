It's Duke/Virginia, Take 2 (Saturday, 6 p.m. ET, ESPN). Who ya got?  Jeff Borzello, college basketball Insider: I thought Virginia would win the first matchup, and I was obviously wrong about that one. But I'm going with the Cavaliers again. I just feel like they match up well in terms of what Duke wants to do, which is play in transition and then get downhill in the half court. Virginia limits its turnovers and keeps drivers out of the lane. Assuming Ty Jerome is healthy, I think Virginia gets the win.Myron Medcalf, senior college basketball writer: Entering the season, I think most would have projected a Duke-Virginia split with each team winning their home game, and like Jeff, I think that still stands. Yes, a shorthanded Duke (Tre Jones didn't play) beat Virginia in the first matchup, but it was a two-point game and Virginia shot just 18 percent from the 3-point line, an odd result for a Cavaliers team that has made nearly 40 percent of its shots from beyond the arc this season. I think Virginia wins another tight game in the rematch, but scrap all of this if Jerome is hurt.John Gasaway, college basketball writer: I'll take Duke, even if Jerome does hobble dramatically onto the court for the opening tip. (We really need to get these two teams together sometime when we're not diverted into injury talk. Maybe it'll happen at the Final Four.) My hoops spidey sense keeps going back to what we saw in the first game: Virginia occasionally looked stymied on offense by the Blue Devils' switching. Conversely, RJ Barrett was 10-of-13 on his 2s and put up 30 points. Blue Devils in a close one.Jordan Schultz, Insider/analyst: Give me the young Dukies once again! While both teams rank in the top five of KenPom's offensive and defensive efficiency, this pick is in part because Jerome's injury casts a serious spell on the Hoos' offense. It's not as if UVa suddenly can't make shots -- it went 6-for-17 (35 percent) from 3 without him in a home win over Miami -- but Virginia still fell victim to a less efficient offense. In fact, its 56 points scored was the second-lowest total of the season. Even if Jerome plays, I like the Blue Devils for the same reasons I liked them the first time: Their rare combination of blue-chip talent and speed will prove to be the difference in Charlottesville. Expect Zion Williamson -- the likely Wooden Award winner -- to firmly put his stamp on this game with a 25-point double-double.Meanwhile, the Big East has become a two-team race and will pivot on Saturday's Villanova/Marquette contest in Milwaukee. The Golden Eagles have been tough at Fiserv Forum, but after falling to St. John's on Tuesday, could you see them beating Nova?Medcalf: I could see it since Marquette has made 40.5 percent of its 3-pointers in Big East play, the Golden Eagles have Markus Howard and they've already defeated comparable, if not superior, teams: Kansas State, Wisconsin and Louisville. But having the juice to win a game like this is a lot different than actually executing and getting the victory. The latter is a difficult ask because Villanova is playing the best basketball in the league right now, their best players (Eric Paschall, Phil Booth) avoid foul trouble while creating 40 minutes of matchup problems for opponents and their head coach has a couple of national titles.Borzello: I think Marquette bounces back and gets a huge win over Villanova. It's true the Wildcats are playing much better of late, but the winning streak has sort of papered over the cracks of their defense, which is giving up more than one point per possession in Big East play. St. John's has forced Howard into subpar games with length and athleticism; Villanova can't really match that on the perimeter. I think Howard gets hot and Marquette gets a win.Gasaway: The thing people miss about Marquette because of the Markus Howard Experience is that this might be the best defense in the Big East. That being said, the Golden Eagles' numbers for chasing conference opponents off the 3-point line are great in part because they haven't had to play Villanova yet. This is going to come down to the Villanova offense against the Marquette D, and I feel a patented Nova 3-point eruption coming after that subpar shooting game against Creighton. I'll take Jay Wright's guys.Schultz: Yes, Marquette bounces back with a key home victory over the fighting Jay Wrights, who have quietly notched 11 straight wins. Markus Howard -- whom I slotted on my midseason first-team All-American squad -- is a walking bucket and the most explosive scorer in the country (he already has had a 53-point game). The fact is Villanova simply does not have its typical assortment of top-flight guards or rim protectors to coerce Howard into an off day. This is the main reason why the Wildcats are ranked outside the top 80 in defensive efficiency, per KenPom, and outside the top 200 in blocked shots. This Big East affair will be tight in Milwaukee, but Howard will prove to be the difference.Keeping in mind that the last SIX Final Fours have included at least one 7-seed or worse, give us one team currently outside the AP top 25 that has the ability to make a realistic Final Four run come March.Medcalf: Mike Daum is averaging 24.9 points and 11.3 rebounds for a South Dakota State team that has made 42.7 percent of its 3-pointers this season, comparable to the mark Loyola-Chicago had when it began its Final Four run a year ago. The Jackrabbits, who have lost only one league game this season, and the 6-foot-9 Daum could get hot in March.Borzello: The easy way out would be to pick one of the teams in ""Others receiving votes."" The Washingtons, the Auburns, the Baylors. But I'll go a step further. I think St. John's will be an annoying team to play, and if Shamorie Ponds gets hot, the Red Storm can make a run. I tend to get infatuated with teams that have guys who can go get a bucket late in a game, and the Red Storm might have the best one in the country in Ponds. He can carry them.Gasaway: By the way, all those low seeds then promptly lose in the national semifinal. Well, except for 2014 (UConn). Anyway, on that hopeful note, I'll take Jeff's easy way out (he's trolling me) and toss a bouquet at Baylor. Pollsters and bracketologists can't get around the Bears' early-season losses to Texas Southern and Stephen F. Austin, and that's fair. But, somehow, this same group that lost to the Tigers and Lumberjacks has in fact been the best per-possession team in Big 12 play.Schultz: I would like to put Buffalo here, but the Bulls are still a top-25 team. So, how about Murray State? Admittedly, this is not the most balanced roster in America, but in case you haven't heard, Ja Morant is pretty darn good. The best point guard in America is tops in the nation with an incredible 10.3 APG to complement his robust scoring (24.1 PPG). This is a bit of a risky choice because Belmont -- which already beat the Racers on the road -- is also very good, and the Ohio Valley Conference is probably a one-bid league. Selfishly, we all deserve to see a little more Morant after he torched both Alabama and Auburn (31.5 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 6 APG) in near upsets. Why can't the potential top-three pick have a great run in March?ESPN.com expert picks for this week's top games(Lines, published as they become available, from the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook.)

25948768,"Wildcats head coach Sean Miller said after Thursday night's 67-60 loss to Washington that he backed the board's statement, though he declined to answer three of six questions about Phelps or the legal issues surrounding the Arizona program.
""If you guys would like to ask me questions about tonight's game I'll be more than happy to answer, but I'm not going to comment on anything related to off the court,"" Miller said at the end of his opening statement.
Arizona on Wednesday initiated the process to terminate Phelps, and a day later, regents chair Ron Shoopman said in a statement that the school removed Phelps ""following due process provided in policy.""
""The board is confident this decision was made to ensure the utmost integrity and highest standards in the UA men's basketball program,"" Shoopman said in the statement. ""As the governing body of Arizona's public universities, the board is committed to doing everything possible to uphold the excellence and quality of the institutions we oversee, including the athletic programs at the universities.""
Miller said of the board's comments, ""I support the statement that went out.""
The regents will reconvene for their final day of meetings Friday morning in Tempe, Arizona.
Phelps' attorney, Donald Maurice Jackson, of Montgomery, Alabama, said Phelps was removed because of an alleged NCAA rules violation.
The school said Wednesday in a statement that Phelps' removal was ""not related to the federal criminal proceedings in New York or the NCAA's review of the facts underlying the allegations of unlawful conduct.""
Sources told ESPN that Phelps is accused of a violation regarding former Arizona recruit Shareef O'Neal's academic transcripts. O'Neal, the son of former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal, committed to the Wildcats in 2017 before signing with UCLA. O'Neal sat out this season because of a heart condition.
Phelps, in his fourth season on Arizona's staff, denies wrongdoing and has cooperated with university and NCAA investigators, Jackson told ESPN.
Thursday marked the Wildcats' first game since Phelps' removal.
Afterward, Miller declined to answer questions about whether Arizona would miss Phelps, when he'll be able to comment about the ongoing investigation and what his level of concern was about being subpoenaed to testify in the federal trial.
Arizona junior center Chase Jeter said Phelps' absence ""doesn't affect practice,"" but senior guard Justin Coleman said the Wildcats played for Phelps on Thursday night.
""We love coach Phelps,"" Coleman said. ""He's still part of us as a team. The time he was here, he taught me how to be a better player, a better man. But from now one we just got to push forward, continue to get better.""

25960499,"Tennessee has been ranked No. 1 in The Associated Press poll the past three weeks, has one loss this season and owns Division I's longest winning streak.
But it wasn't enough for the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee to give the Volunteers the top overall seed in its initial rankings. The committee revealed its preliminary rankings Saturday and it was Duke, not the Vols, earning the No. 1 overall seed.
The Blue Devils were No. 1 in the East Region and the Vols topped the South, with Virginia in the Midwest and Gonzaga out West earning the other No. 1 seeds.
""They are heading to the East by the slightest of margins,"" committee chairman and Stanford athletic director Bernard Muir said. ""There was a very close conversation between the No. 1 seed and the No. 2 seed, but the strength of schedule won out in Duke's case.""
The Blue Devils crushed the competition last week ahead of a rematch with Virginia. Who's hot on the leaderboard heading into the showdown?
Here's your updated source for all of the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
Duke was slated to play in Washington, D.C., in an East Region that includes Michigan, Marquette and Iowa State. Tennessee tops a South Region in Louisville, Kentucky, with North Carolina, Purdue and Nevada. Virginia led a Midwest Region in Kansas City, Missouri, that also includes Kentucky, Houston and Wisconsin. The West Region in Anaheim, California, had Michigan State, Kansas and Louisville with the Zags.
The initial rankings offered a preview of the committee's thoughts five weeks before Selection Sunday, on March 17. The NCAA ditched the RPI this season for its own ranking system, the NCAA Evaluation Tool, to select teams for the NCAA tournament. The NET relies on game results, strength of schedule, game location, scoring margin, offensive and defensive efficiency and quality of wins and losses.
Duke (21-2, 9-1 ACC after beating Virginia on Saturday) has losses to Gonzaga and Syracuse, but blew out Kentucky in its season opener, knocked off Auburn and Texas Tech and plays in the loaded ACC. Tennessee's only loss was to then-No. 2 Kansas. It has the longest winning streak in school history, with 18 straight victories after beating Florida on Saturday.
The Vols (21-1, 10-0) moved to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 in Week 12 after Duke's loss to Syracuse.
""When I say they're the No. 2 seed, really, in the committee's mind, it was 1A and 1B,"" Muir said.
Muir went on to say defending national champion Villanova was the last team out of the rankings, with Virginia Tech, Texas Tech and LSU also being considered. Kentucky, the top No. 2 seed, was placed in Kansas City instead of playing just down the road in Louisville, so it can't play No. 1 Duke until the Final Four.
Kansas was moved out West for competitive balance in the bracket. Lawrence is about 40 miles from the Sprint Center in Kansas City. Nevada, No. 6 in the AP poll, was the No. 14 overall seed in the initial rankings after opening the season 21-1. The Wolf Pack's loss came at New Mexico on Jan. 5, and Muir said they were close to earning a No. 3 seed.
""We're so happy to be part of today, but we know there's five weeks of basketball to be played and a lot of work to be done by a lot of teams, including ourselves,"" Nevada coach Eric Musselman said. ""We just want to get better in all facets of the game. We have a lot of tough venues on the road. With eight games to play, anything can happen.""
Louisville was placed in Anaheim because the South Region will be played on the Cardinals' home court, giving them an unfair advantage.

25975401,"The Mountaineers announced the dismissals Monday night without elaboration.
Ahmad was the team's third-leading scorer this season at 12 points per game and the third-leading rebounder at 5.8. Harris averaged 7.9 points and 4.5 rebounds.
Ahmad is a senior and four-year starter. Harris is a junior in his second year as a starter.
The dismissals come during a tumultuous season for the Mountaineers (10-14, 2-9 Big 12), who are in last place in the league and have lost 10 of their past 12 games.
West Virginia is coming off a 75-53 home loss to Texas and plays at No. 14 Kansas (18-6, 7-4) on Saturday.

25961323,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- After No. 2 Duke beat No. 3 Virginia by double digits on Saturday night -- a game LeBron James and Rajon Rondo just had to see in person --  the Blue Devils returned to the visitors locker room and acted like a bunch of kids.
Alex O'Connell held up a shoe as if it were a microphone and asked Tre Jones to comment about his performance.
Zion Williamson claimed he didn't notice James, which prompted a teammate to yell, ""That's your big brother!""
""Stop it, bro,"" Williamson said.
They were screaming in the shower. They were interrupting each other. They were laughing about whatever 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds laugh about when they're around one another.
It belied the moment.
The presence of James and Rondo, coupled with a significant victory over a Virginia squad with Final Four aspirations, was all stitched together into the season's most pivotal realization: Duke has now reached the point where anything short of a national title will seem like an incomplete season for this talented group.
If these players understand they've reached that point, they do not conduct themselves like a team that notices -- or cares.
""What pressure?"" RJ Barrett said after scoring 26 points and finishing with a 6-for-10 clip from the 3-point line. ""We're just going in. We're young kids and we're just playing hard every night.""
The Blue Devils have wins over Kentucky, Texas Tech, Florida State, Auburn and Virginia (twice). Gonzaga is the only team that has defeated Duke at full strength.
But Saturday's win, on the road, against one of America's best, comprised the program's most impressive effort to date. The Blue Devils made 62 percent of their 3-pointers, despite entering the game with one of the nation's worst marks (30.8 percent) from beyond the arc. Even when Virginia made runs -- at one point cutting Duke's lead to four -- the Blue Devils always seemed ready to get serious again and put more space between them and the Cavaliers (and perhaps the rest of America).
""As good as the game in Durham was, this one was better,"" coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ""I thought both teams played outstanding basketball tonight. It's tough to single out a kid. We were fortunate we won. That's the best we shot from the 3-point line, and obviously that's a huge difference, and the fast breaks.
""They're outstanding and we were really good too. And it was that game. We feel very thankful that we won. I'm proud of my guys, but we beat a heck of a team and they're a great program. We're obviously very pleased.""
The Blue Devils now join a lengthy list of programs that seemed insurmountable at this point in the season. Some fell short of expectations.
That's why you'll likely hear the refrain ""anything can happen in March"" as Duke advances toward the NCAA tournament. That phrase is a reminder that teams are often set up for failure at this level. Last year, a soaring Virginia team became the first top seed to lose to a 16-seed in the opening round. This sport does not offer any guarantees in a single-elimination tournament.
Duke players said they remained ""focused"" on opponent Virginia on Saturday, despite Lakers stars LeBron James and Rajon Rondo in attendance.
Here's your updated source for all of the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
But Duke has displayed its potential to turn ""anything can happen"" into a positive message come March.
Anything can happen? True. Like hitting more than 60 percent of its 3-pointers on the road against a top-five team, which is what happened on Saturday. Or fighting through injuries -- Duke beat Virginia in the first game without Tre Jones and defeated Florida State although Williamson was sidelined most of the game with an eye injury.
For Duke, ""anything can happen"" means the Blue Devils seem capable of overcoming any scenario.
This might be Duke's year. Sure, its season could end without a national title. The list of teams that have fallen short is a lengthy one. That won't change, however, the expectations attached to these Blue Devils.
They do not feel that heat, though. And that will help them as they navigate the final months of the season.
""Obviously, it's not a lot I need to tell them,"" junior Marques Bolden said about his younger teammates. ""They were groomed for this moment. They've handled the season and all the things that have come to us very well, so for them to keep doing what they're doing at this level is special for them.""
By now, you've probably seen The Block.
Late in Saturday's win, Williamson broad-jumped across the John Paul Jones Arena court and sent De'Andre Hunter's 3-point attempt to Richmond.
""Coach said no 3s,"" Williamson explained. ""And I was trying to get out there and make him drive, but he shot it so I blocked it.""
You probably did not see, however, the reaction from the folks in the front row who caught Williamson as he hit the brakes. They seemed stunned, frustrated and impressed all at once.
They couldn't figure it out. How'd he do it? How'd Duke do it?
That's the question.
Williamson & Co. might lose again. They might lose in March. They might not reach Minneapolis.
But everyone watching, LeBron included, will expect this special season to end with a crown.
At this point, any alternative would make as much sense as the physics of Williamson's block.

25930994,"Federal Judge Kari Dooley in Bridgeport on Monday approved a motion by UConn to reject Ollie's request, deciding it was filed prematurely. Dooley did not rule on the merits of the request.
Ollie and UConn officials are in arbitration related to his internal grievance over his firing last March. Collective bargaining rules say UConn can end the arbitration if Ollie files a discrimination complaint with either the state Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities or the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Ollie is concerned that deadlines to file a discrimination complaint will pass before the arbitration is complete, and he asked the judge to allow him to move forward with the complaint during the arbitration. UConn has said it won't waive the collective bargaining rules if Ollie files a complaint.
The university fired Ollie in March after a 14-18 season, citing NCAA recruiting violations. The school said that because the firing was ""for cause,"" it did not have to pay Ollie about $10 million left on his contract.
Ollie, who is black, plans to file a racial discrimination complaint against UConn, saying the school treated him differently from former coach Jim Calhoun, who is white and wasn't fired after being penalized for recruiting violations.
Ollie's lawyers said Dooley's ruling will allow Ollie to raise the same issues at a later date and that they are confident Ollie will be able to file his discrimination claims after the arbitration.
""We are obviously disappointed by the court's decision,"" Ollie lawyer Jacques Parenteau said in a statement. ""We believe that the University of Connecticut's efforts to deter Coach Ollie from pursuing and preserving his discrimination claims are sufficient to trigger the jurisdiction of the federal court. We are reviewing the decision for purposes of appeal.
""Kevin Ollie understands that fighting for his rights against the University of Connecticut is a difficult undertaking, but make no mistake about it; Kevin Ollie is playing a long game,"" the statement said.
Messages seeking comment were left with UConn's lawyers.

25923557,"Editor's note: The NCAA tournament Bubble Watch has been updated through the games of Saturday.
We know that Kentucky, Tennessee and LSU are the three best teams in the SEC, we just don't know in what order. The Wildcats have muddied the picture by losing at home to the Tigers in the last second of the game but then beating the Volunteers by 17 at Rupp just four nights later.
The one thing we do know, however, is that collectively Kentucky, Tennessee and LSU form one of the strongest trios the league has seen in a long time. In fact, these are the best of times for SEC hoops.
For starters, the conference is poised to make its biggest splash on the top four seed lines of the NCAA tournament bracket in 17 years. Consider Joe Lunardi's projected bracket.
Lunardi has Tennessee as a No. 1 seed, Kentucky as a No. 2 and LSU on the No. 4 line. If those seeds hold on Selection Sunday, it will mark the SEC's best showing at the top of the bracket since 2002.
The actual bracket is still a month away from being released, of course, but current projections reveal the extent to which the SEC may be rising while other major conferences are in danger of taking a step back.
True, the ACC and Big Ten look about the same as last season in terms of throwing their top-four-seed weight around. But what appears likely is that the SEC's rise in this category is being fueled by significant year-to-year declines recorded by both the Big 12 and the Big East.
Here's how we're projecting the bubble right now:
Bids from traditional ""one-bid"" leagues: 23 teams
Locks: 17 teams
The bubble: 34  teams for 28 available spots
Should be in: 13 teams
Work to do: 21  teams
ACC | Big 12| Big East | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC | American | Others

Locks: Virginia, Duke, North Carolina, Louisville

Virginia Tech Hokies 
Virginia Tech's conference opponents are attempting a truly historic number of 3s. Meaning in the history of major-conference play dating back over the last decade and beyond, we've never seen a defense allow this many 3-point attempts. To be sure, this hasn't prevented the Hokies' D from clocking in right at the league average for points allowed per possession. Still, if this potential No. 5 seed is paired with a perimeter-oriented opponent in a March bracket (Villanova?), be aware that the potential exists for opponent-induced 3-point mayhem.

Florida State Seminoles 
With wins over not only Purdue and LSU but also Louisville, those mid-January losses at Boston College and at Pittsburgh actually loom a bit larger. Indeed, at the time, it seemed like the whole season might go sideways for Leonard Hamilton's men. Instead, those losses are now looking more and more like underachievement from a team whose other defeats came at the hands of Villanova, Virginia and Duke. Florida State's now won seven straight and is cruising toward a No. 6 seed (if not better) with the league's best 2-point FG defense in ACC play. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Syracuse Orange
It's not easy winning road games in the ACC, certainly, but the concern for Syracuse goes beyond a 15-point loss at NC State. The concern is that Jim Boeheim's group, never presumed to be a high-powered offense, is scoring at a rate that's low by even the most modest expectations. In the past three outings, Oshae Brissett, Tyus Battle and their teammates have produced just 0.89 points per possession. Scoring from beyond the arc has been in particularly short supply, and Syracuse has given the ball away on 21 percent of its possessions in those games. To recap, this is a team nominally in line for a No. 8 or 9 seed but one that's also in a scoring slump as it prepares to host Louisville and Duke at the Carrier Dome. There's a lot on the line for the Orange in the coming days. (Updated: Feb. 13)
NC State Wolfpack 
Bubble Watch is on the record as hyping the importance of NC State's current two-game swing. Well, halfway into said swing, Kevin Keatts' men are taking care of business. The Wolfpack beat Syracuse 73-58 in Raleigh, giving this group what could (depending what Clemson does) turn out to be its first win over an eventual NCAA tournament team since it defeated Auburn back in December. Now comes the mother of all ACC opportunities: Duke in Cameron Indoor. Torin Dorn and his teammates are being projected as a No. 9 or 10 seed, but needless to say, a win in Durham this weekend could alter that expectation. (Updated: Feb. 13)
Clemson Tigers
Brad Brownell's team has announced its arrival in Bubble Watch -- with back-to-back, one-point losses. That can happen. Bubble Watch, like the committee itself, takes the long, whole-season view, and losing consecutive nail-biters at Miami and at Louisville is not in itself a deal-breaker. At 5-7 in ACC play but with an eight-point win over Virginia Tech at Littlejohn Coliseum serving as this team's headline statement, the Tigers are projected as a No. 10 or 11 seed. Then again, the loss at the hand of the Hurricanes was Clemson's third Quad 2 defeat of the season. In sum, a 5-7 conference record in mid-February does raise the stakes for looming home dates against Florida State and North Carolina, not to mention upcoming road games against the Quad 2 likes of Pittsburgh and Notre Dame.(Updated: Feb. 16)

Iowa State Cyclones 
The loss at home to TCU was not only surprising, it reduced Iowa State's chances of winning a share of the Big 12 title. In terms of NCAA seeding impact, however, a single defeat at the hands of (one presumes) another at-large team, even at home, isn't going to move the needle all that much. Falling to the Horned Frogs represented the Cyclones' second Quad 2 loss of the season, but Wisconsin also made its way to the No. 4 line in the bracket preview and the Badgers had already lost two Quad 2 games. This isn't a deal-breaker for ISU, just as long as the Clones don't get it into their heads to keep doing this kind of thing. (Updated: Feb. 9)
Kansas State Wildcats 
It is time to ponder whether the team that might (repeat, might) end the incredible 14-year streak of Kansas conference titles might not also be a threat for a really nice seed. One thing we know already is that Kansas State is making opponents uncomfortable. For a second consecutive season, the Wildcats lead the Big 12 in opponent turnover percentage in conference play. That might sound like the mark of a team that's pressing full court and trying to speed up the tempo, but Bruce Weber's guys actually play at the slowest pace in the league. Most importantly, that strategy is working. Kansas State is a projected No. 6 seed right now, but that might not be the end of the story. (Updated: Feb. 12)
Baylor Bears 
Scott Drew's team is still struggling to get healthy and whole. King McClure has now missed three straight games due to an ailing knee, and Makai Mason has been in and out of action while struggling with a toe issue. Both players missed the Bears' 86-61 loss at Texas Tech. Devonte Bandoo has done some heroic work in February trying to fill the absence of two starters with 3-pointers, but a 25-point defeat in Lubbock suggests Drew needs McClure and Mason back sooner rather than later. The population of teams in a strong Big 12 that can beat a shorthanded version of a projected No. 8 seed such as Baylor is fairly large. (Updated: Feb. 16)
TCU Horned Frogs 
In a Big 12 that's hardly lacking for good defense, TCU is trending toward being the exception to that rule. Indeed, among the league's eight teams that are playing for NCAA tournament position, the Horned Frogs are the outlier on D, allowing 1.08 points per possession in conference play. That's not an outlandish figure, but TCU's interior defense in particular is looking shaky. The Big 12 has converted 54 percent of its 2-pointers against the Frogs, and in Oklahoma's nine-point win in Fort Worth, Kristian Doolittle lit up Jamie Dixon's guys to the tune of 21 points on 8-of-11 shooting inside the arc. If TCU does land around the No. 8 line as expected, a top seed could find the paint to its liking on offense in the round of 32. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Texas Longhorns 
Call it luck, karma or toughness in crunch time, but Texas looks stronger statistically than your ordinary 7-6 Big 12 team. Those six losses, by the way, have come by a combined 27 points. The Longhorns are expected to draw something in the neighborhood of a No. 9 seed, and this group could definitely give a top seed a game in the round of 32. With a neutral-floor win over North Carolina to their credit (not to mention wins at home over Purdue and Kansas), Shaka Smart's men make up possibly the most dangerous 15-11 team you've ever seen. Yes, that's a non sequitur. Sometimes those are true. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Oklahoma Sooners 
To this point in 2019 calendar year, OU has defeated one at-large-quality opponent, and now the Sooners have done so twice this season. In earning the season sweep over TCU, Lon Kruger's men looked more impressive than they have at any point in the conference season. Oklahoma threw a stingy zone defense at the Horned Frogs in Schollmaier Arena, and the visitors cruised to a 71-62 win. OU is still very much in double-digit seed territory (this is, after all, a team that's 4-9 in the Big 12 and 16-10 overall), but for the first time in a long time, the Sooners look capable of playing in a manner that will keep them in the bracket.

Villanova Wildcats 
Few coaches talk a better woe-are-we game than Jay Wright. By that, of course, Bubble Watch refers to the art of talking like you or your team isn't very good even though you or your team is in fact very good. The coach who has won two of the past three national titles has been at it again this month (""We're not a great team. We're just trying to keep getting better""), and it's true that this group of Wildcats is no match for what we saw a year ago. Nevertheless, presumptive 2019 No. 5 seed Villanova is doing highly impressive and indeed game-changing work in the area of shot volume. In particular, the Wildcat program can boast a ridiculously low, league-leading turnover percentage in Big East play for a second consecutive season. Listen to what Wright says but also watch what his team does. (Updated: Feb. 13)
St. John's Red Storm
""Welcome back to another episode of 'We swept Marquette.' We're your hosts, the St. John's Red Storm. We just won a home game against Butler, 77-73 in overtime. John Gasaway would probably say that's not that big a deal, but losing certainly would have been. Now we're up to .500 in Big East play, showing up in the mock brackets as a No. 9 seed and getting ready to host Villanova at the Garden this weekend. Sounds like we could be moving up to 'should be in' very soon. Join us again next time, and remember: We swept Marquette."" (Updated: Feb. 12)
Seton Hall Pirates 
Myles Powell was apparently tired of Markus Howard getting all the attention for high-volume scoring in the Big East. The junior went off for 30 points, punctuated by 10-of-10 shooting at the line, as Seton Hall cruised past Georgetown 90-75 in Newark. Just two weeks removed from a four-game losing streak, the Pirates are back to .500 in conference play, thanks to victories at home over Creighton and the Hoyas. That said, no team projected as a No. 12 seed can feel too comfortable, and this weekend's game against the Bluejays in Omaha could be tougher than it looks. Greg McDermott's team carries a 4-8 record in the Big East, but three of those losses came in overtime. (Updated: Feb. 13)
Butler Bulldogs 
At 6-7 in Big East play and with its marquee win being a neutral-floor victory over Florida, Butler badly needs to upgrade its profile. The Bulldogs have road games remaining at Marquette and Villanova, and a win in at least one of those contests is now looking more or less essential for a team listed as ""first four out"" by Lunardi.

Wisconsin Badgers 
Life is brutal at the top of the Big Ten. Ethan Happ has scored 38 points and pulled down 23 rebounds in the past two games, and all that got Wisconsin was losses to Michigan and Michigan State. Nick Ward was particularly effective on Happ for the Spartans, forcing the Badgers senior into six turnovers and making him take 20 shots to get his 20 points. Now Greg Gard's team, which is 0-2 since it was tapped as a No. 4 seed in the NCAA's bracket preview, gets a welcome six days of rest before returning to the court at home against Illinois. (Updated: Feb. 12)
Maryland Terrapins 
If you've watched Maryland this season, you've likely been told this is one of the youngest teams in the country. That is indeed correct, and it helps explain both how good this team is and how great it could become. As one would expect from a youthful group, the Terrapins have suffered from an exceedingly large turnover disparity in Big Ten play. Take turnovers out of that equation, however, and Bruno Fernando, Anthony Cowan and company can play with, literally, anyone. In the Terps' 13-point loss at Michigan, for example, this young team that's a presumed No. 6 seed actually came close (1.08 points per no-turnover possession) to matching the Wolverines (1.10) on turnover-neutral scoring. The fact that Maryland committed 16 turnovers and U-M had just six, however, translated into a double-digit margin of defeat. (Updated Feb. 16)
Iowa Hawkeyes 
If you're not watching Iowa, you're missing hands-down the most entertaining team in the nation, world, you name it. Not content to merely beat Northwestern with a last-second 3 by Jordan Bohannon in Iowa City, the Hawkeyes took their cardiac-kids routine to Rutgers. This time it was Joe Wieskamp who hit the last second game-winner off of a deflected full-court baseball pass, with the added kicker that it was a corner 3 that actually grazed the backboard. (Are you not entertained?) It's two wins, regardless of how Iowa happened to get it done. Fran McCaffery's men are 20-5 and heading toward a potential No. 6 seed.(Updated: Feb. 16)
Ohio State Buckeyes
A 63-56 loss at home to Illinois constitutes a Quad 3 defeat for Ohio State, the team's first such setback. In other words, the game is literally the Buckeyes' worst loss of the season in profile terms. Then again, Baylor's walking around whistling a happy tune in the brackets as a projected No. 8 seed even though the Bears have suffered two Quad 4 losses. Meaning the worry for OSU isn't necessarily the loss itself, one that this team's profile can well absorb. (Yet another reason why that win at Cincinnati is so valuable.) Rather, the concern is whether the outcome marks a new turn for the worse in performance. (Updated: Feb. 15)
Minnesota Golden Gophers 
When last we checked in on the Gophers, Bubble Watch had this to say: ""Minnesota is a 6-8 Big Ten team being shown as a No. 11 seed in mid-February. Everything in that sentence fairly screams, 'Win some games.'"" The good news for Richard Pitino's men is that they are now a 7-8 Big Ten team being shown as a No. 11 seed after they thrashed Indiana 84-63 at Williams Arena. Now the table is set for the big one: Michigan is coming to the Twin Cities, and a win there, paired with the road victory the Gophers already recorded at Wisconsin, would push this team a long way toward ""should be in"" status. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Indiana Hoosiers 
You're wondering why an Indiana team that's 4-10 in the Big Ten and has lost 10 of its past 11 is still here after losing by 21 on the road to a Minnesota team that is itself kind of bubbly. That's easy. The Hoosiers are here because they started that game as proud members of a number of reputable mock brackets. IU was able to attain that status, of course, because that 11th game in the recent stretch was, incredibly, a win at Michigan State. Pair that with victories against Marquette and Louisville and you have a profile that could get you in the field of 68 if Indiana decides to start winning games. But, right now, the Hoosiers really don't look like they're going to decide to start winning games.(Updated: Feb. 16)

Washington Huskies 
Mike Hopkins' men will likely reach Selection Sunday showing a road victory at Oregon as their best win. That may not sound particularly impressive, but this is in fact the Pac-12's best per-possession team by a healthy margin, one that's likely to post a gaudy W-L record in conference play. All of the above may well result in a seed in the middle of the bracket and, consequently, a game against a high seed in the round of 32.. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Arizona State Sun Devils 
The Sun Devils would likely be in the field of 68, barely, if the selection were held today. Absent the most extreme string of either wins or losses in the arid Quad-1-scarce savannah known as the Pac-12, ASU could remain in this state of bubbly uncertainty for the foreseeable future. True, the upcoming road game at Oregon would in fact qualify as Quad 1 at this writing. Nevertheless, Arizona State has already done its best work under this heading, having won at home against Kansas and Washington and in Las Vegas against Mississippi State and Utah State.

Mississippi State Bulldogs 
Just hours before MSU tipped off its game at Arkansas, the athletic department in Starkville announced that 6-foot-2 sophomore Nick Weatherspoon had been suspended indefinitely due to an unspecified violation of team rules. That was no issue against the Razorbacks, as Ben Howland's team won 77-67. Indeed, Howland can put Tyson Carter in Weatherspoon's starting spot, as the coach did in Fayetteville, and see a similar level of performance. Losing depth is never a positive, of course, but it's not clear the suspension will have a significant impact in the near term on a team that's being envisioned as a No. 7 seed. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Auburn Tigers 
The knock on the Tigers is that that they're an efficient bunch beloved of laptops but that, oh by the way, Auburn doesn't actually beat any good teams. Bruce Pearl's men are just 2-5 against SEC opponents listed as locks, should-be in's or work-to-do's by Bubble Watch, and the wins came at home against Alabama and Florida. AU won't get a chance to change its ""all stats, no statements"" reputation until it plays at Kentucky next weekend. In the meantime, a team that's being shown as anything from a No. 7 to a No. 9 seed would be well advised to take care of business mid-week at home against Arkansas.(Updated: Feb. 13)
Ole Miss Rebels
Ole Miss has what might be the cleanest profile an 18-7 team could construct for itself. Every one of those seven losses, for example, falls under the heading of Quad 1. Plus, the Rebels now own road wins not only against Auburn, but also at Mississippi State. If Kermit Davis and his men emerge at 20-7 after this current take-care-of-business interlude (Ole Miss won at home against Missouri and will now visit South Carolina before returning to Oxford to play Georgia), we might be envisioning the Rebels as a step up from a No. 8 seed. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Alabama Crimson Tide 
As a genre that has proliferated over the past decade or so, the bubble watch typically exists to overreact to the most recent game played. Naturally, we here capital-B-and-W Bubble Watch would never stoop to such hackery, so you can trust us when we say Alabama's most recent game was aberrantly damaging to the Crimson Tide's bracket position. Avery Johnson's team entered its home game against Florida as a projected No. 10 seed, but losing 71-53 in Tuscaloosa to an opponent that started the contest 13-11 and ranked No. 40 in the NET does you no seeding favors. Alabama would still likely make the tournament if the selection were held today, but something as low-profile as the upcoming road game at Texas A&M now takes on added importance. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Florida Gators 
Look who's still hanging around in ""first four out"" territory. The Gators are now 14-11 and 6-6 in SEC play, not numbers that necessarily translate seamlessly into ""at-large."" Then again, this is also a group with two Quad 1 wins (at Arkansas and at Alabama) and a NET ranking that has been hovering in the 30s and 40s. The 18-point victory at Tuscaloosa was, easily, the Gators' most complete performance of the conference season and could not have come at a better time. LSU is up next, in Baton Rouge.

Mick Cronin's team went scoreless over the final 6:11 of the game and lost 65-58 at Houston. Jarron Cumberland scored 27 points for UC (albeit on 25 shots), but it was not to be. The outcome represents a lost chance to earn a higher seed, far and away the best single opportunity the Bearcats will get before Selection Sunday. Then again, there's no shortage of teams in the American or, indeed, nationally, that would gladly switch places with a group cruising toward something in the neighborhood of a No. 7 seed. (Updated: Feb. 10)
UCF Knights
Give UCF credit. The Knights have shown an unmistakable ability to cling tenaciously to what's supposed to be a precarious spot: the very bottom of the at-large field. According to Joe Lunardi, Johnny Dawkins' team would be one of the last teams in the field not sent to Dayton if the season ended today. That status is holding steady after UCF took care of South Florida at home 78-65. The Knights will get the opportunity to strengthen their hold on an at-large bid thanks to two remaining games against Cincinnati and one at Houston. First up, however, is a home date against Memphis. (Updated: Feb. 13)
Temple Owls
Speaking of the very bottom of the at-large field, Temple is moving in somewhat the same bubble circles as UCF. The Knights have the superior NET ranking (in the 40s, versus the 50-something rank carried by the Owls), but of course, it's Fran Dunphy's men who have the win to end all American wins: Houston's only loss of the season came against Temple on Jan. 9 in the Liacouras Center. One potential worry for the Owls, however, is that barring an encounter in the conference tournament, their games against the Cougars and the Bearcats are already in the books. There'll be no more regular-season chances at the biggest wins in the conference. Then again, Temple and UCF meet head-to-head in the last game of the season in Philadelphia. That showdown could have a bubble implication or three. (Updated: Feb. 13)

Running the table would give Buffalo a 16-2 record in the MAC, but even dropping a game along the way, as UB already did at Northern Illinois and at Bowling Green, wouldn't wreck a profile that includes a win at Syracuse. UB appears to be heading for something in the neighborhood of a No. 7 seed.

Wofford Terriers
The Southern Conference has never sent an at-large team to the NCAA tournament, but there's a first time for everything. Wofford is in this discussion because the Terriers are 23-4, with the losses coming to North Carolina, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mississippi State. Mike Young's team additionally own Quad 1 wins at UNC Greensboro and East Tennessee State. Finally, it's worth noting Wofford won at South Carolina by 20, even though that shows up on the profile as a Quad 2 victory.(Updated: Feb. 16)
VCU Rams
If Bubble Watch is correct to be bullish on how well a somewhat underrated Texas team might perform the rest of the way, the correctness will be good news for VCU. Any impressive exploits yet to be recorded by the Longhorns can only add luster to the tournament profile of a Rams team that went to Austin on Dec. 5 and came away with a 54-53 win. (Feast your eyes, the score itself says ""hard-fought."") Will that profile be enough to get Mike Rhoades' team an at-large bid? Quite possibly, but make no mistake, recent selection history doesn't furnish too many feel-good precedents. It's likely to be a close call. (Updated: Feb. 13)

Welcome to the fun, Bisons. We here at Bubble Watch Mission Control have been watching you for a while now. You can be justly proud of Rob Marberry's Ethan Happ-like post mastery (with better foul shooting), the team-wide attention to detail and total mastery on the defensive glass and, yes, your road win at TCU in November. Historically speaking, the at-large-bid production of the Atlantic Sun has not been what one would term voluminous, but your combination of the marquee win with a 30-ish ranking in the NCAA Evaluation Tool promises to make this an interesting next few weeks. Congratulations, and one last thing. You can thank your ranked-60-something-in-the-RPI lucky stars that the old metric is gone. Bubble Watch rejoices with you there.

25909441,"During a brief news conference before the Kansas-Texas Tech game, Long said the school had provided the NCAA with all documents or information requested, and had held De Sousa out of competition in good faith all season.
""I have always respected the NCAA and trusted the process, but I must tell you that my faith has been shaken,"" Long said. ""We stand behind our student-athletes when we believe they've been wronged.""
At issue is not whether De Sousa's guardian, Fenny Falmagne, accepted a $2,500 payment from former Adidas consultant T.J. Gassnola to steer the prospect to Kansas. Rather, it's whether De Sousa, a native of Angola, had any knowledge of the pay-for-play scheme or benefited from it in any way.
De Sousa's name came up during Gassnola's testimony last summer amid the FBI's corruption probe into college basketball. Gassnola acknowledged making the payment to Falmagne, but he steadfastly denied coach Bill Self or anybody associated with Kansas knew of it.
Still, Long said the NCAA would consider De Sousa's reinstatement only under two conditions: The school had to declare him ineligible, which it did Jan. 13, and Kansas had to identify Gassnola as an agent or booster of its program ""only as a hypothetical for the purposes of reinstatement.""
""We disagreed on Gassnola's role in all of it,"" Long said.
But with no other alternatives, Long said Kansas agreed to the conditions and began the reinstatement process. That dragged on for three weeks before the NCAA handed down its punishment.
Kansas responded with a swift statement late Friday in which it vowed to challenge the decision.
""I do feel our university will do whatever they humanly can to create a situation to put our best foot forward to get that penalty reduced, without question,"" Self said Saturday. ""I know that Jeff and our chancellor are on board with fighting for [De Sousa] -- not that you wouldn't fight for every student-athlete, you should. But this one is a little more special the way he's handled everything so far.""
Self said that De Sousa has remained upbeat throughout the uncertainty, and he has remained a key part of Jayhawks practice. He will still be allowed to practice with the team and, assuming the NCAA grants him a waiver, will be allowed to accompany the team on road trips the rest of the season.
""Nothing really surprises me based on recent things we've read about other institutions,"" Self said, ""but I would say that I don't think it's time for us to move on. I don't think we go into this planning on having him -- we prepare like we don't, and if we ever get him it would be a bonus. But regardless of the situation, we have to and should and want to fight and advocate for him.""
Texas Tech coach Chris Beard was much more succinct.
""The NCAA does what they do,"" Beard said after his No. 16 Red Raiders were routed by the 11th-ranked Jayhawks 79-63, ""stuff that makes no sense.""

Seth Greenberg and Dan Dakich give you an all-access pass inside the world of college basketball. Listen now!
And you, in the stands, or on your couch, shouting a few things, depending on your late-game philosophy:
""Foul him!""
Or ...
""Defense!""
Oh, those nerve-wracking final seconds. They're when a coach's ego and philosophy come out; when we see if the team has practiced and is confident enough to execute its late-game doctrine.
""This is the time of year where coaches must really sharpen their special-situation plays,"" coach Fran Fraschilla said, ""because at the end of a conference race, in the conference tournament, or in the NCAA tournament, one seemingly minor play could make the difference in your season.""
""Most guys develop a philosophy that fits their personnel and the competition they play and practice it and live with it,"" coach Seth Greenberg said.
Coach Dan Dakich pointed to a fouling trend: ""The sport's trending where teams foul more, because more teams shoot the ball better from more spots. More stretch-4s, stretch-5s. It used to be just guarding one or two guys close, and you take your chances with a guy who's maybe a 20, 25 percent 3-point shooter. Every game is different, and it depends on how much you practice, but I think more teams are fouling simply because more guys can shoot it better.""
We turned to our coaches to give us a breakdown of their own coaching philosophies.
Fran Fraschilla: ""My philosophy has evolved through the years -- mainly because of my role as a TV analyst here at ESPN, having watched so many games, and so many of those situations. When I was a young coach, I wanted my team to be smart and tough, and so we were not going to foul up three, but instead have that 'macho' approach and say: 'They're not hitting a 3 on our defense.' But as I've seen situations and recognize that the analytics may lend themselves to fouling being the smart play, I've adjusted my thought process.
I'd foul with five seconds or less because if you foul earlier, you give the other team a chance to foul you again, and gain an extra possession. So if you foul with 11 seconds to go, they make their free throws, and they foul you with eight seconds, we're right back in the same situation. So we're fouling five seconds or less. Either way is never 100 percent the right way. Whatever you decide: practice -- and this is the time of year to sharpen it.""
A good NC State team made headlines by scoring 24 points last week. We asked the coaches to recall nightmarish games of their own.
Two of ESPN's coach analysts point to a certain Tennessee head coach regarding similar coaching styles.
We asked our coaches to tell us about the technical fouls they remember best. Guess which coach got his 14 seconds into his first game?
Dan Dakich: ""In my world, I never really fouled: I wanted to play defense. That's changed -- I'd foul now. If there are eight seconds left, I'd make sure they dribble a few times, then with five seconds -- always five seconds -- I'd foul.
It happened that one time it cost us not going to the NCAA tournament. We'd won the MAC. We were up by three, playing Miami (Ohio); there was 16 seconds to go, and my thought was: 'All right. Too much time. We hadn't practiced it with that much time.' I had a pretty good defensive team, so we played great defense -- then Miami attempted a 2 with about six seconds to go. I thought, 'That's great!' But I'll never forget it -- my point guard didn't block out the guy who shot it, who then got it back, threw it to a kid standing somewhere between the top of the key and half court and he drilled a 3. It ended up going to overtime, and they beat us. At that time, I said I wouldn't foul, but after watching it and seeing so many teams come back, I think I would foul now.""
Seth Greenberg: ""When you're up three, you want to defend the full court, turn the ball handler, support with the inbounder, and any time you just count a second to dribble, so basically once you get under five seconds, I'm comfortable giving a foul. You must practice it, because if you don't, guys are so good at playing through the contact that it becomes a factor. But there is so much more that comes into it: if you're not a good free throw block-out team, if you're undersized -- let's say you're playing North Carolina. They're very good at back-tapping a missed free throw and getting an extra possession.
I lost a game to Tyler Hansbrough in the ACC tournament in a free throw situation. This wasn't the exact scenario, but there, we were up by one -- they missed a free throw, they back-tapped, and Hansbrough got the ball and scored on a jumper -- started running around like a gecko. The size of your frontcourt matters.
We lost a very tough game to Tulane with a chance to win a half of the C-USA championship when I was at South Florida on a half-court 3; and that famous shot obviously to Duke that lost us a game, that was the chance to give the foul. All decisions you make in a split-second. Hopefully you've practiced them.""

25933062,"MANHATTAN, Kan. -- Sure as the celebration launched by the rush of humanity that flooded the court as the seconds ticked away on Kansas State's 74-67 win over Kansas on Tuesday, the Jayhawks' remarkable streak of Big 12 dominance is in danger.
This sixth KU loss in seven true road games felt different than the others, different than the rout at the hands of Iowa State and the late lead inexplicably blown at West Virginia.
It felt different because Kansas can always -- well, almost always -- count on righting its wrongs against rival K-State. Not on this night, which marked the first win by Kansas State over KU in nearly four years and just its fifth over the Jayhawks in 31 games at Bramlage Coliseum.
These Wildcats have hit their stride since the return of senior forward Dean Wade, the preseason Big 12 player of the year who missed six games in December and January with a foot injury.
His absence turned K-State into a dark horse. But you might remember that coach Bruce Weber's team danced within one win of the Final Four a year ago and began this season as the most real threat to dethrone Kansas in the league.
With five weeks to go, well, here they are -- alone atop the Big 12 standings at 7-2 as Baylor visits Texas on Wednesday with a chance to match K-State's mark. Iowa State is lurking, too, one back of the Wildcats in the loss column.
No. 13 Kansas, meanwhile, sits tied for fourth with Texas Tech at 6-4. Fourth place after 14 straight regular-season Big 12 titles. The last time the Jayhawks won fewer than seven of their first 10 league games? It was 25 years ago in the Big Eight.
KU has real concerns that extend beyond its conference record and the scoreboard in Manhattan. The Jayhawks remain without big men Udoka Azubuike, out for the season, and Silvio De Sousa, suspended for all of this year and next.
Veteran guard Marcus Garrett did not play Tuesday because of an ankle injury. Lagerald Vick logged just four minutes in the first half and did not start the second half because of an undisclosed concern.
As a result, a 15th straight Big 12 championship ought to rank down the list of Kansas' priorities.
""We ain't even worried about that,"" forward Dedric Lawson said. ""We're just worried about getting better.""
Good idea, coach Bill Self said. Despite the temptation to consider scenarios ahead of K-State's Feb. 25 visit to Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks are better off staying focused on their own issues, according to Self.
Here's your updated source for all of the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
""We shouldn't even be concerned about the damn race right now,"" he said.
""Are we in a great position to win the league? No. Do we deserve to be in a great position? Absolutely not. Can we flip the switch? It remains to be seen.""
Kansas possesses the skill, with Lawson and Vick as major scoring threats. Freshman Devon Dotson sparkled at times Tuesday, while fellow rookies Quentin Grimes and Ochai Agbaji struggled in their Sunflower Showdown debuts.
The Jayhawks committed 23 turnovers, prompting Self to describe the performance as ""one of the worst days of offensive execution"" that he could recall.
""It's leadership. It's toughness. It's inexperience,"" the coach said.
Mental toughness and physical toughness.
""This team doesn't have much of it right now,"" Self said.
""Our young kids have never been in a situation like that. They ate us up pretty good. We were never, ever remotely comfortable. And that's a credit to them.""
Yes, credit Kansas State. With Wade, senior guard Barry Brown and sophomore Cartier Diarra, whose windmill dunk in the final minute nearly blew the roof off Bramlage, Kansas State isn't going away.
""We could have come over here and played great tonight and still lost,"" Self said. ""They've got a really good team.""
After Baylor goes to Texas, Kansas State is the only Big 12 contender with five league road games remaining -- starting Saturday at Baylor. The Bears also must still travel to Lawrence.
""To me, the most important thing, we're in first place,"" Weber said. ""Long way to go. I hope it's not finished.""
Kansas State surely doesn't look finished. As for the Kansas streak, as Self said, it remains to be seen.

25953759,"Less than a year removed from their 21-point throttling of Arizona in the NCAA tournament and a school-record 27-win season, and just weeks after the school's first win against Syracuse since 1963 (in the Carrier Dome, to boot) this is the new normal for the Buffalo Bulls.
The man at the forefront of it all is Nate Oats, a spry 44-year-old former high school math teacher who was coaching hoops at Romulus High School in greater Detroit less than six years ago. He's risen quickly behind the firm belief that the players come first, and on a style predicated on trust.
""We did a culture playbook two summers ago and our three main beliefs -- core values, we call them -- are max effort, continuous growth and selfless love,"" Oats said. He has expanded on the playbook by adding a blue-collar element to his program that reflects Buffalo itself -- a city with a rich history hit hard by various industrial changes, but with continued economic growth -- and a friendly, hardworking attitude.
During games, the staff charts what it calls blue-collar points -- deflections, hustle plays, charges -- any type of winning play that doesn't register in the box score. The player with the most points earns a construction helmet after the game.
""It gives us a visual representation of how we should conduct ourselves and how we should think out there on the court,"" says senior guard CJ Massinburg, a first-team All-MAC performer who tallied 43 points in an upset road win (Buffalo was an 11-point underdog) over West Virginia and who has received the award multiple times.
""We do whatever we can to make the players feel special,"" Oats told ESPN, ""but in return we're gonna demand a lot out of them. I think we've done a really good job building relationships with guys.""
After grinding it out as a successful Division III player at tiny Maranatha Baptist University in his hometown of Watertown, Wisconsin, Oats sought out coaching as a means to stay involved in the game he loved most. A quick search of his office reveals a slew of old coaching manuals -- tomes by Bob Huggins, Rick Majerus, Del Harris, Hubie Brown and Coach K are all favorites -- as well as a tediously organized drawer of old playbooks and notes.
""I love basketball. But I knew I wasn't gonna play for money,"" Oats said.
Oats -- whose Romulus teams were consistently ranked nationally and captured their first state title in nearly three decades under his guidance -- quickly built up equity among the Buffalo players as an assistant under Bobby Hurley. When Hurley accepted an offer to become the head coach at Arizona State nearly four years ago, Oats knew it was a tall order to expect the head-coaching position at UB, given his unconventional route up the coaching ladder.
But then-athletic director Danny White interviewed the players, and every single one of them advocated for Oats to get the job.
""What stood out is the connections [Nate] had with our players,"" White said. ""His reputation as a high school coach -- most people I asked said he ran it like a Division I college program. Players had a strong relationship with him.""
The positive sentiments were also echoed by Hurley, who informed White that his young assistant had already taken on a considerable coaching load in addition to building a strong rapport with the roster. And, if White didn't promote him, Hurley would surely retain his services in Tempe.
""I had a spot for Nate [at Arizona State] and I never gave that a second thought,"" Hurley said.
""I knew how passionate he was how and how hardworking he was. He was getting a lot out of our players. He's a really good recruiter. ... He invests building relationships with the guys.""
Additionally, Oats preaches a suffocating brand of both individual and team defense, along with a complex offensive playbook full of NBA sets and built-in counters. The Bulls are one of the few teams in college basketball to rank in the top 30 of both offensive and defensive efficiency, per KenPom.
""We don't care who we're playing -- we're gonna come out and be the aggressors,"" he said. ""As long as you play hard and you give us max effort with a great attitude, I'm going to let you play through slumps.""
Such a philosophy also manifests itself in recruiting, where the mission for Oats and his staff is not necessarily to get the highest-rated prospects, but the ones who best fit the program. Massinburg, for example, was a virtually unrecruited guard from Dallas with one Division I offer, from Prairie View A&M. Oats initially anticipated he would redshirt, but Massinburg worked his way into the rotation early, broke out with a 17-point effort at Duke, and never looked back. Massinburg -- who has a chance to become the school's all-time leading scorer -- has since become an indispensable member of the team and a perfect representation of that Buffalo blue-collar work ethic.
This season's freshman class, meanwhile, features Jeenathan Williams, a four-star recruit and the school's highest-ranked prospect ever to sign out of high school. The Bulls also inked Instagram sensation Ronaldo Segu, an electric point guard the staff has high hopes for and affectionately deems ""Rondo.""
""There are so many mistakes made in recruiting,"" Oats said. ""You don't have to get guys ranked in the top 100. ... We compete at everything. Even walk-throughs, shootarounds. Some kids that's not for them. What we really want, is talented, good-character kids. I want competitive kids.""
Competition even expanded into the summer, when the Bulls' coaching staff organized a four-day team retreat, in an effort to build camaraderie and trust, that omitted phones and included hill-running as well as players holding the same rope to climb a mountain.
Few players personify the significance of trust more than senior guard Dontay Caruthers -- a former MAC Defensive Player of the Year -- who leads the Bulls with a 44 percent clip from deep. Caruthers has been in the Buffalo program for three years.
""I didn't like school,"" he said. ""I love it now."" Caruthers is currently pursuing his master's degree in educational studies.
""I've been able to find my confidence thanks to him [Oats] and my teammates. I don't think any other coach would do that,"" Caruthers said.
Hurley says it's Oats' experience at inner-city Romulus that helps him connect with players.
""He worked with kids that didn't come from ideal backgrounds all the time,"" Hurley said. ""We have to be able to relate to our players and understand their struggles and their lives away from basketball.""
Confidence was forged throughout last season, when the Bulls felt they were really on the cusp of something special -- even if Oats wasn't always so sure.
""Here's what we said,"" he recalled. ""The first time that we play a high major on a neutral floor with our entire roster is gonna be in the NCAA tournament, and we're gonna beat 'em. That's what we said all year. Then we get to Sunday night. Arizona comes up as a 4-seed and you're like, 'Man, they got screwed.' They should have been at least a 3-seed, maybe even a 2. And then your name comes up two seconds later [a 13-seed].
""I thought we deserved an 11 or a 12. I wasn't excited, but I couldn't let the players see. You get back to the office later that night after the watch party and then you start studying the film. I actually convinced myself -- which you have to do, and then convince the players -- that this was a great matchup.""
The Wildcats had momentum and Deandre Ayton, the eventual No. 1 pick in the 2018 NBA draft. But the Bulls had both the experience and the belief that they were the better team.
And they were right. The Bulls won 89-68.
Success generates exposure to new situations and first-class problems. After his team knocked off Arizona, Oats provided bulletin board material for coach John Calipari and Kentucky, Buffalo's second-round opponent.
""I'm maybe too honest, too naive, too stupid, haven't dealt with media enough,"" Oats said. ""I made a comment before the Kentucky game. Basically a high school coach of mine had sent me a text, 'Cal's been whining about his youth.' So I said the same word [whining, to the media]; I should have just said Cal's been commenting about his lack of experience.""
Kentucky knocked off the Bulls 95-75.
""Lesson learned,"" Oats said. ""But I'm gonna say what I gotta say.""
""It left a bitter taste in our mouths,"" Massinburg said. ""We came into this year with the confidence we had last year.""
Success and confidence also amounts to expectations, to which Oats says: ""I don't want our guys thinking 'Final Four or bust.' Our thing was, let's talk about what our ceiling can be, and then let's be peaking at the end of the year.""
Today, the elephant in the room is whether or not Oats will look to climb the coaching ranks and join a Power 5 program with a larger budget and the bells and whistles to match.
""That's the question of the year right now,"" Oats acknowledged. But it's a question shaped by more than basketball.
More than three years ago, Oats and his wife, Crystal, discovered that she had a rare form of cancer called double-hit lymphoma. Oats' coaching career immediately became secondary.
The family was able to lean on the school's medical program to connect with a new doctor and begin treatment.
""I walked in and said, 'What are we gonna do? If I need to step away for however much time it takes, that's what I'll do.' Right away she says, 'No, no, no, you're not doing that. This is your dream. We can get through this. You're gonna coach this team,'"" Oats said. ""And the entire community of Buffalo just embraced our family through the whole thing.""
Crystal's cancer is now in remission.
""We love it here,"" Oats said of Buffalo. ""Ideally we don't leave; we've built something special here and want to continue developing it. There may be a job out there somewhere that would be hard to say no to -- I don't know what that would be, though. Any decisions we would make would be what is best for our family. And Buffalo has shown our family amazing support in many areas and we're confident they'll continue to support us here. We've got a good feeling they're gonna make it really hard to leave, and hopefully we stay here for a long time.""
The school does not want its bright young leader to leave either, especially after rewarding him with a salary raise to $600,000. It makes Oats the second-highest-paid coach in the MAC.
The mood at shootaround is light but focused. Associate head coach Jim Whitesell, a 35-year veteran of coaching, runs much of the Ball State scouting, walking through everything from specific sets to player tendencies and out-of-bounds specials. The top priority is for the scout team to properly execute the Ball State offense, which will provide a basis of what to expect in the game.
""Let's do diamond formation,"" Whitesell says, wanting to simulate one of the Cardinals' offensive sets. But things go awry and the intensity level drops momentarily.
""Run it again,"" Whitesell demands. ""Obviously we're not doing it right. Pay attention, pay attention. Offense, I need you guys to run their s---!""
""You gotta go with more pace, A.J.,"" he instructs redshirt guard Antwain Johnson, a Middle Tennessee transfer who will be eligible next season.

""Hands, hands, hands!"" Whitesell tells his defense.
""Can we try a game with zero moving screens?"" Oats implores his team. ""Let's try to get our turnovers back in single digits by eliminating stupid moving screens. ... If you pass up an open shot that ends up in a turnover, you're coming out of the game. I'm tired of passing up open shots. It's stupid.""
(In the game that night, Segu would pass up a wide-open 3 and subsequently turn the ball over, to which Oats yelled, ""Shoot the ball!"")
One constant to any Bulls practice is competition. It represents the fabric of everything they hope to accomplish. To conclude shootaround, the team must make 80 3-pointers in five minutes -- the caveat being that if you miss two in a row, you then have to make 10 at the other end of the floor to get back into the drill. In a vacuum, everything is a competition because that is precisely how you learn to win.
About 20 minutes before tipoff, the Bulls head back to their locker room for a visualization exercise conducted by Arnie Guin, the team's mental skills coach. Perhaps no message hits home more than a Bill Russell quote he asks the guys to consider: ""Concentration and mental toughness are the margin of victory.""
Assistant coach Bryan Hodgson, who has been instrumental in anchoring the Bulls' impressive recruiting efforts, shares his thoughts with the guards, who have a tough assignment defending second-team all-conference shooting guard Tayler Persons: ""Pressure him, but be solid. Don't need to reach, we've known that. You guys have guarded the s--- out of him for two years.""
True to form, Buffalo races out to a 7-0 lead behind suffocating defense. Despite an 0-3 shooting start, senior forward Jeremy Harris makes three successive winning plays -- two offensive boards and a pass that leads to free throw attempts.
More than halfway through the first half, Ball State has as many points (six) as it does turnovers. The only problem: Buffalo can't seem to find any sort of offensive rhythm either. One of the most lethal transition attacks in the country continually comes up empty-handed in the open floor and so too does the Bulls' normally well-oiled half-court offense.
""That was the worst half of offensive basketball I've ever seen,"" Oats tells his staff before speaking with his team at intermission. Even with the offense sputtering, though, this remains the type of gritty, blue-collar game Oats wants -- a formula he believes will serve his team well in a single-elimination tournament setting. Physicality, defense and toughness often prevail, even when you can't throw it in the ocean.
""Quit avoiding contact. Get your butt to the free throw line,"" Oats tells his team before tipoff. ""Soft teams can't win in March.""
Ultimately, though, the Bulls prove to be anything but soft, prevailing with an 83-59 win while holding Ball State to a woeful 32 percent from the floor on 2-23 (8.7 percent) from 3, while turning the Cardinals over 18 times. Persons -- who averages 17 PPG -- is held to just six points on 2-of-12 shooting, one of the worst games of his career.
These days, there is a familiar sight at Bulls games for Oats, one which brings tremendous comfort. With Crystal's cancer in remission, she and their three daughters regularly attend games, even on the road. In the wake of Crystal's battle for her life, Oats now sees both basketball and life through a different, more balanced lens.
""When you go through cancer, there's a lot that's changed about me since three years ago,"" he said. ""It puts everything in perspective. ... At the end of the day, there's no pressure. You're putting a ball through a ring. So I do think it's made me a better coach.
""There's stuff that you get as a teacher -- dealing with kids on an everyday basis -- that you don't get as an assistant. I taught these kids in class, but I taught their girlfriends. I had interactions with 150 kids a day for 11 years. There's all kinds of stuff that now I can relate better to. ... The unconventional route to where I've got, I wouldn't trade how I got here for anything.""

25923528,"""Win or lose, you've got to have amnesia,"" former coach and ESPN college basketball analyst Fran Fraschilla said. ""One close loss, one blowout loss, one great win doesn't define your season. My motto was, 'All we wanna do is start a one-game winning streak.'""
Former coach and ESPN analyst Seth Greenberg -- who recalled a bad loss to Boston College immediately after his Virginia Tech team defeated No. 1 Duke in 2011 -- agreed. ""Especially in league play, you've got to learn from it, obviously, but you have to have a short-term memory because you've got another game in two, three days. Can't harbor on the past.""
NC State would certainly like to move on. According to ESPN Stats & Information, the Wolfpack hadn't scored fewer than 15 points in a half in the past decade (they didn't reach that mark in either half of this loss). They shot 17.3 percent from the field, the worst mark in school history.
But bad losses happen to everyone in basketball, as all our coaches say.
This week, in keeping with the spirit of the annual NBA and College Basketball Crossover on ESPN, NBA analyst P.J. Carlesimo joins Greenberg, Fraschilla and ESPN college hoops analyst Dan Dakich. Carlesimo coached at Wagner for six seasons before taking over at Seton Hall in 1982. He stayed there until he left for the NBA in 1994. He took the Pirates to the 1988-89 title game, in which they lost to Michigan 80-79 in overtime.
Two of ESPN's coach analysts point to a certain Tennessee head coach regarding similar coaching styles.
We asked our coaches to tell us about the technical fouls they remember best. Guess which coach got his 14 seconds into his first game?
Every week, we ask our coaches to tell us something we don't know. This week, a certain Michigan State coach is a popular subject.
Dan Dakich: In 1999, Bowling Green had started 6-1, and we were in the top 30 in the country. We'd beaten Hawaii at Hawaii and won a tournament. Then we went to West Virginia and played a bad WVU team. They didn't have a home court, and they had to play in a civic center in Charleston, and they beat us by 46 freaking points [final score: 100-54]. After the game, I told my players to hurry up and dress and get in the bus before West Virginia came down here to beat the hell out of them again. I used it for fire all season long. We won our last six and won the MAC East outright for the first time since 1983. Two years later, West Virginia hires me as head coach. [Dakich returned to coach Bowling Green eight days after accepting the Mountaineers job.] And during the introductory press conference, the athletic director says, ""Well, we've had our eye on Dan since we played them a few years ago."" And I said, ""Really? You know you beat me by 46 points, and you had your eye on me? What's wrong with you people?""

Seth Greenberg and Dan Dakich give you an all-access pass inside the world of college basketball. Listen now!
Seth Greenberg: My first year at Virginia Tech, we're in the Big East. We travel to Rutgers. Obviously, I'm a New Yorker, so I've got probably 100 people there: family, friends, college roommates, aunts, uncles, high school friends. We come out, score the first bucket, run a counter play, go up 4-nothing, my group's going crazy, and in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, ""You know what? This is pretty good!"" Then Rutgers scores the next 34 points. We get obliterated 85-52. I was so ticked off and mad after the game that we played so poorly that I waited in the locker room and told someone to send my mom home. I waited until everyone was gone, but my college roommate was hiding around the corner. So when I came out, he turns to me and goes, ""Hey, Greeny, you're really good at this coaching thing.""
Fran Fraschilla: In my first year attempting to rebuild St. John's basketball program, our December schedule included games against Michigan, Villanova and a very good Minnesota team that eventually went to the Final Four that year. We played competitively in the first two games, but in our third game, out at Williams Arena, we were beaten 77-39 by Clem Haskins' club. He left his starters in the entire game. It's not something I would have done, but I certainly wasn't mad at him for that; every coach coaches their own team. While I wanted to crawl underneath the stands, all I could think of was, ""We have to get better players."" They clearly had outclassed us that day. Luckily, that kind of loss fueled some competitive fire. We continued to get better in Year 1 and made it back to the NCAA tournament the next year. I don't care if you're Coach K or a young coach starting out in Division I: Everybody has had these experiences, often numerous times. It's part of competition.
Although coach Carlesimo didn't zone in on a single game, he talked about the challenges of turning around a program -- his modus operandi at the collegiate and professional levels -- and how tough it is for coaches to do so nowadays, in an era when quick wins and quick exits seem more common.
P.J. Carlesimo: I remember some bad losses in the NBA: the Denver Nuggets beating us [Seattle SuperSonics] by about 100 points [Denver won by 52] and the Utah Jazz beating us [Portland Trail Blazers] bad in the postseason. But college? I can't think of a specific game because there were so, so many. My first year at Wagner, my first Division I job, we won three games. [Their biggest loss that season was by 34 points to Villanova.] My first year at the Hall, we won six games, then nine the following season. We got drilled a bunch during my first four or five years there. The Big East was so good. The thing that was different about the Big East, though, which started with Dave Gavitt at Providence, was that coaches would go out of their way to not embarrass you -- and we were on the other end of that a lot. I vividly remember nights when teams would make a couple of extra passes, would stop pressing, stop fast-breaking. I coached for a lot of rebuilding programs, and some coaches -- probably smarter than me -- won't take those jobs, and there's nothing wrong with that.
The reason I took Wagner -- aside from it being a Division I job when I was 27 -- is it was a job a lot of people didn't want. Lots of losing seasons in a row in Division III, then the athletic director moved up to Division I. He wanted a young coach out of Division I -- I'd been at Fordham -- who wouldn't mind taking a lot of losses. Some coaches don't want those losses, which is totally fine. Others smarter than me could turn the programs around much quicker. I knew things would take a long time. Same with Seton Hall. It was in the Big East, but the bottom of the Big East, so a lot of people thought it was a bad job. Not a good facility on campus, either, especially compared to other teams in the conference. It's not easy when the losses accumulate or there are big losses. It's almost easier when you lose a close one, so you just change one or two things moving forward. The time and patience help.
Many of my most vivid memories of that 1988-89 Seton Hall team is that the school stayed with us. Virtually every other school would have fired me and my coaching staff. They allowed us to turn it around, even after a long time. That's why that run and success was so enjoyable. I remember thinking this team was good enough to make the Final Four, but it would have been with a different coaching staff. But the school stayed with us and gave us that opportunity to get our record back. Unfortunately, that's less and less the case. It's one of the really negative things that's more commonplace in college sports across the board lately. Totally unrealistic and unfair to coaches.

25972895,"The NCAA Division I Basketball Committee slated Duke as the No. 1 overall seed in its initial tournament rankings over the weekend. Voters in the AP Top 25 stuck with Tennessee as their top team.
The Vols received 40 of 64 first-place votes from a media panel in the poll released Monday, remaining ahead of Duke for fourth straight week. The No. 2 Blue Devils had 24 first-place votes.
First-place votes in parentheses
No. 3 Gonzaga and No. 4 Virginia, the other top seeds in the NCAA's initial rankings Saturday, rounded out the top five with Kentucky.
Tennessee (22-1, 10-0 SEC) moved to the No. 1 spot in the AP poll after Duke (21-2, 9-1 ACC) lost to Syracuse on Jan. 14.
The Vols continued winning, stretching their school-record streak to 18 games with wins over Missouri and Florida last week.
Committee chair Bernard Muir said the decision for the top overall seed was close, but Blue Devils edged the Vols based on strength of schedule.
Tennessee was No. 1 in the South Region.
""I want these guys to enjoy what they're doing and I'm probably not the easiest guy to let that happen because I'm always thinking of ways we can get better, and I want to do it right now,"" Vols coach Rick Barnes said. ""I appreciate how hard they're competed and the fact that they want to get better.""
The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee gives Duke the top seed over Tennessee in its initial rankings. ""It was 1A and 1B,"" committee chairman Bernard Muir said.
Duke won both of its games last week, rolling over Boston College by 25 before winning a rematch with Virginia 81-71 on Saturday. The Blue Devils needed overtime to beat the Cavaliers the first meeting and shot them out of the gym in the second, making 13 of 21 from the 3-point arc.
""We were just in our zone and it's great to see when our team is like that,"" said Duke's RJ Barrett, who had 26 points and was 6-for-10 on 3s.
Virginia dropped one spot after losing to the Blue Devils.
BIG 12 RACE
Kansas State moved back into the poll this week at No. 18.
Perhaps more importantly, the Wildcats are in control of the Big 12 race after knocking off rival Kansas and Baylor last week.
The Wildcats (18-5) are 8-2 in the Big 12, putting them 1½ games ahead of the 14th-ranked Jayhawks, No. 15 Texas Tech and No. 23 Iowa State. Kansas State plays Texas and Iowa State this week.
Kansas will need to make a late-season run for the second straight year if it is going to stretch its record run of conference titles to 15. The Jayhawks play TCU and West Virginia.
ZIGGING ZAGS
Gonzaga moved up a spot in the AP poll this week, was selected as the top overall seed in the West by the NCAA's selection committee and crushed WCC rival Saint Mary's 94-46 on Saturday.
But it wasn't all good news for the Zags last week.
Gonzaga forward Killian Tillie did not play against the Gaels and is out indefinitely after suffering a torn ligament in his right foot against San Francisco on Thursday. He missed the first two months of the season due to a foot injury and has played just nine games.
MOVING UP
No. 17 Florida State had the biggest jump in this week's poll, climbing five spots after beating Syracuse and Louisville, which remained at No. 16 despite the loss.
No. 9 Houston and No. 12 Purdue each moved up three spots.
MOVING DOWN
No. 22 Virginia Tech had a precipitous drop this week, falling 11 spots after losses to Louisville and Clemson.

""We need him here for a couple weeks,"" La La Vick told The Star. ""I need him. There's a lot going on. It'll work out.""
Vick played a season-low 19 minutes in Kansas' loss at Kansas State on Tuesday, scoring just seven points. The 6-foot-5 guard's scoring performances have trended downward as the season has progressed, after he averaged 24.6 points and made 28 3-pointers during a five-game stretch in November and early December. Since scoring 29 points against Villanova on Dec. 15, Vick has hit the 15-point mark just twice.
On the season, he's averaging 14.1 points and four rebounds and shooting 45.5 percent from 3-point range. In Kansas' six losses, however, Vick's numbers drop to 10 points on 32.4 percent 3-point shooting.
Vick originally was not expected back in Lawrence for his senior season. He declared for the NBA draft following Kansas' Final Four campaign, and Self proceeded as if Vick would not be back with the Jayhawks this season. Vick then withdrew his name from the draft much to the surprise of Self.
""The talk we had at the end of the season would be that he would go somewhere else if he decided to stay in school,"" Self told ESPN in June. ""That was something we talked about; we kind of agreed on that.""
After Self flew to Memphis to meet with Vick and his mother, though, the school announced in late June that Vick was returning to the team.
Kansas is chasing its 15th straight Big 12 regular-season title, but the Jayhawks have dropped into a tie for fourth place after the loss to Kansas State earlier this week. In addition to Vick, Kansas lost center Udoka Azubuike for the season with an injury in early January and has been without sophomore Silvio De Sousa all season because of an NCAA eligibility issue. Marcus Garrett has also missed the past two games with an ankle injury.
The Jayhawks (17-6, 6-4 Big 12) host Oklahoma State on Saturday.

Weber did not say when Diarra would have surgery, nor did he say whether the sophomore would be back this season. Weber said only that ""I know he will work hard to come back strong.""

25960724,"MILWAUKEE -- The play that might define Marquette's renaissance season is one the Golden Eagles probably don't make a year ago. Ed Morrow certainly couldn't have made that play. He wasn't even on the court.
UK has teased us before, but Saturday's takedown of top-ranked Tennessee was impossible to fake.
Here's your updated source for all the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
Morrow, a backup forward who sat out last season after transferring from Nebraska, found himself squarely in the path of Marquette triumph or heartbreak Saturday at Fiserv Forum. Marquette led 66-65, but it was winning time for No. 14 Villanova, the defending national champion, which had the ball in the hands of the ultimate winner -- fifth-year senior guard Phil Booth. Villanova is 155-20 when Booth plays. Another tick on the left side of the ledger seemed inevitable for a Wildcats team riding a program-record 10-0 start to Big East play. Also inevitable, a second straight one-point, final-possession home loss for No. 10 Marquette. Especially when Booth turned the corner with six seconds left.
But Morrow moved to his right, cutting off Booth under the basket. With no room to shoot, Booth chucked the ball toward teammate Jermaine Samuels, who flung a no-chance shot as time expired.
""Booth got by his man, and Ed stepped up and protected our basket like we wanted him to, like was in our game plan,"" coach Steve Wojciechowski said. ""So we made Booth pass. Obviously, it was a game-winning play.""
Marquette became a top-10 team because it has started making more winning plays on defense. It will stay there because of the play Morrow made under his own basket. And if Marquette makes its first meaningful NCAA tournament run since it reached the Elite Eight under Buzz Williams in 2013 -- it will be because of its growth on defense. No one recognizes this more than Markus Howard, which is kind of ironic. He's the show here, the national star. He's what those outside Marquette know about the program. He showed why on Saturday, scoring 38 points -- his 14th career 30-point performance -- including 21 of Marquette's 30 first-half points. On an afternoon when the Hauser brothers, Sam  and Joey, combined for just four points in more than 61 combined minutes, Howard carried the offense as he so often does, getting help from Sacar Anim in the second half.
""He single-handedly beat us,"" Villanova coach Jay Wright said. ""It would be stupid not to say that.""
Career (2016-17 season - present) 
But Howard knows he simply would be the frontman of a going-nowhere band if Marquette hadn't significantly improved on defense. Howard averaged 20.4 points per game last season. Marquette went to the NIT. It also ranked 182nd in adjusted defensive efficiency, according to KenPom data. This year, Marquette has jumped to 38th, and leads the Big East in opponent field goal percentage defense, more than seven percentage points better than last year. It defends well enough to beat a team like Villanova despite getting 56 of 66 points Saturday from only two players, Howard and Anim (18 points on 8-of-10 shooting).
""Our guys have really owned the fact we had to get better on the defensive end, and we have,"" Wojciechowski said.
Marquette held only four opponents to below 40 percent shooting last year. It has done so 10 times already this season, winning every contest. It would have been 11 if not for a Villanova burst late in the second half. The Wildcats opened the game with a 3-pointer but then missed 13 of their first 14 attempts from long range.
""In the offseason, when we were working out, I could just see a difference in how we defended,"" Howard told ESPN. ""With our length, our size, our commitment to it. I could just see it as soon as we started.""
Marquette's defensive commitment wasn't there Tuesday, as St. John's scored 40 first-half points on 53.3 percent shooting. The Golden Eagles steadied themselves but surrendered a layup to Shamorie Ponds with 16 seconds left that gave St. John's the victory. Wojciechowski admitted his team lacked the connectivity and even the fight that had spurred an eight-game win streak.
""That was not the team we were, not the team we've been,"" Howard said. ""Tonight, we really just wanted to bounce back, and the best way we could is to pick it up on the defensive end.""
When Villanova erased a 15-point deficit in less than six minutes behind Booth and surging freshman Saddiq Bey, Marquette's newfound defensive edge seemed to crack. After Bey stole the ball from Howard with 12.8 seconds left, Marquette was headed toward a reality-check loss against a more proven foe.
But there's a new reality with this team. Forward Theo John, the Big East's best shot-blocker, had two swats and a game-high seven rebounds before fouling out. Anim was active on defense during Villanova's push, and the Hauser brothers didn't let forgettable offensive showings carry over to defense. Morrow, who replaced John, finished with no points but six rebounds and two steals in more than 21 minutes.
""Defense is as much team-oriented as it is individuals playing defense, and they're really well-connected as a team,"" Wright said of Marquette. ""Howard, Anim, [Sam] Hauser, they all get older, and when you get older, you get better defensively. You get more connected.""
Villanova isn't the same team that resoundingly won it all last year, but few teams nationally had played better recently. It's why Anim considered Saturday ""a statement win,"" which will propel the Golden Eagles toward March and possibly their own deep tournament run.
""You kind of figure things out as time goes on,"" Howard said, ""and we have this group of guys that really buy into the process of wanting to play defense. [Wojciechowski] has been on it since I've been here, so I think us as a team, we're willing to do the things necessary to win, and defense is a big part of that.""

25907973,"DURHAM, N.C. -- As the ""Quit Tryin', Draft Zion"" bandwagon builds steam in the NBA, Duke superstar freshman Zion Williamson said he's just enjoying his ride in college.
The mighty Zion Williamson (naturally) is No. 1. But the burgeoning phenomenon that is Ja Morant isn't far behind.
The Blue Devils have been on a roll, so how do they rate in Week 2 of our not-too-serious rankings?
Williamson, who scored 29 points in the No. 2 Blue Devils' 91-61 win over St. John's on Saturday, said he can't help but imagine what the future holds, but he's in no rush to make it a reality.
""You do think about it, but this is the only time I get to experience college,"" Williamson said. ""And even if I could've went straight from high school [to the NBA], I would've come to college. I feel like college is something I couldn't miss out on.""
Williamson's performance -- Saturday was his 10th game with 25 or more points this season, the most ever by a Duke freshman -- has earned rave reviews from scouts, while his highlight-reel dunks made him a household name even before he arrived on Duke's campus.
The combination of skill and celebrity has made him unique, even in a sport with its share of talented one-and-done players dealing with a layover in college.
""The world has changed in the last couple years, and nobody brought in the exposure that he's brought in,"" coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ""He had a million, two million followers [on social media] before he ever got here. When's that happen? But it's happening for him. And we're so high profile, that everything is scrutinized. And his play is looked at by everybody. The thing about that kid is, he doesn't want all that attention, and he handles it so well.""

Williamson was alerted after Saturday's game to a New York newspaper back page, which featured an edited image of stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, along with himself, in Knicks jerseys, and even he couldn't help but smile about the potential.
""I mean, it would be dope to play with KD and Kyrie, but whichever team drafts me, I'll be ready to play hard and work,"" he said.
Williamson said he's appreciative of fans who are eager to see him play for their favorite NBA team, but he's reiterated numerous times that his time at Duke is something he cherishes.
Williamson's teammate, RJ Barrett, is also considered a top NBA draft pick, and he largely echoed the comments.
""I try to stay where I'm at and be in the moment, enjoy winning with my brothers,"" said Barrett, who claims he doesn't watch TV and hasn't followed any of the NBA draft talk. ""When the season's over, I'll think of everything else.""

Barnes said that Pons would be held out of contact Monday but should play Wednesday against the Gamecocks as long as the mask is ready by then.

Routt moved his legs together and in the process trapped Mooney's leg between them, which caused the Texas Tech senior to trip and fall to the court.
After consulting video of the play, officials issued Routt with a Flagrant 2 foul, which carries an automatic ejection.
""I didn't see it personally. Two of our coaches did. The refs did a good job of finding the play,'' Texas Tech coach Chris Beard said.
Moretti made both free throws after the flagrant technical, and Mooney hit a 3-pointer to finish the possession for a 49-22 lead.

25976301,"The lawyer for Meredith Watson said in a statement Friday that Watson had been raped by a former Duke basketball player but did not identify the player. The Times reported Monday that both a childhood friend of Watson's, and Facebook messages Watson exchanged with another friend, identified the player in question as Maggette, who went on to play 14 years in the NBA after attending Duke for one year.
Maggette denied the allegations in a statement to the Times.
""It has only been through media accounts and a statement from Meredith Watson's lawyer that I first learned or heard of anything about these sexual assault allegations,"" he said. ""I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge.""
Watson also has said that Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax sexually assaulted her on Duke's campus in Durham, North Carolina, when they were both students in 2000. A Facebook message from Watson acquired by the Times said she did not report the alleged Fairfax assault after the university discouraged her from pursuing the earlier case against Maggette.
Duke said Saturday it was opening an investigation into the sexual assault allegation made against a former basketball player.
""Duke first learned of the allegations involving a student-athlete last night when they were reported by the media,"" the statement said. ""Coach [Mike] Krzyzewski confirms that he had no knowledge of the alleged conduct from 1999. The university is looking into the matter and will have no further comment at this time.""
Krzyzewski reiterated that after Duke's win against Louisville on Tuesday night.
""At that level for that serious an accusation, it's always university level,"" the coach said. ""Our university, they'll handle everything and that's what should happen.""
Maggette played for the Blue Devils during the 1998-99 season, which culminated in a loss to UConn in the national championship game.
Maggette retired from the NBA in 2013 and now works as an analyst for Fox Sports, which told the Times it was also ""looking into the matter.""

25971936,"Another wild week calls for another round of What's Real and What's Fake in college basketball:
Tony Bennett's team put together an exemplary effort against Duke on Saturday in its 81-71 loss. The highlights (Duke's 61 percent clip from the 3-point line, Zion Williamson's wild block) rightfully led to additional adoration for a Blue Devils team that looks the part of a national champion.
But Virginia's strategy limited Duke's opportunities around the rim. The Cavaliers forced turnovers on nearly one-fourth of Duke's possessions. Duke might be the only team in the country that would have left Charlottesville with a win and a 54 percent success rate inside the arc on Saturday night.
Bennett probably wants no part of a third game with Duke in the ACC tournament or a rematch in the Final Four -- both possibilities -- but who else could foil this Virginia squad that did everything in its power to force Duke, which entered the game shooting under 31 percent from beyond the arc, to live on the perimeter for an entire game?
Had Duke produced a 3-point clip closer to its average -- let's say, 7-for-21 -- Virginia might have won by 10.
Tre Jones struggled to advance the ball past midcourt in the first half against Kihei Clark's pressure. Virginia robbed the Blue Devils of driving lanes and forced their stars to take difficult shots.
Virginia sustained its defensive pressure throughout the game, but a great Duke team got hot and neutralized the Cavs. Still, anyone who watched Bennett's squad play effective basketball on every possession knows how imposing this Virginia squad could be in March.
Whenever a new coach takes over a struggling program, he usually makes immediate changes aimed at eradicating the problems that led to his predecessor's dismissal. But it takes time. And Tom Crean, Georgia's first-year head coach, has apparently run out of patience with his group.
After his team's 16-point home loss to Ole Miss on Saturday, Crean said he blamed himself ""because I'm the one who decided to keep these guys."" Um ...OK?
He added: ""It doesn't mean that they are not great kids, but very few programs when there's a takeover, when you have guys that haven't done it at any point in time really in their career, a lot of those guys, they move on. That's what happens in a job change. And I didn't do that. So I'm not going to complain. We've just got to keep doing everything we can do to fix it and make it better.""
Georgia is 1-9 in the SEC. That's why Crean worked hard to land Anthony Edwards, the No. 5 recruit in the country per ESPN.com, and other elite prospects. But the idea that his team would have been better off if he'd kicked guys off the team when he took the job is a preposterous in-season statement.
Yes, coaches often remove players or encourage those that don't fit their culture to transfer when they take new jobs. But they usually don't demean the ones who remain because it's counterproductive. It's also a knock against former Georgia coach Mark Fox. And it's not like Crean left Archie Miller an abundance of talent at Indiana.
Crean is basically saying, ""You all stink and I should have booted you when I had the chance."" What a bizarre statement to make. He's bashing young men whose only sin was staying with this team.
The NBA teams that covet Zion Williamson not only want him for his unique skill set, but they're also aware of the frenzy around him and the potential to monetize it at the next level. The atmosphere Williamson generated during Duke's win over Virginia in Charlottesville is a significant element of his appeal.
Before the game, hundreds of fans lined the sidewalks as they waited to spill into the arena. Hours earlier, Cavaliers fans rose early to attend College GameDay.
The Blue Devils' pressure defense helped them rally from a 23-point second-half deficit.
Here's your updated source for all the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
New Georgia Bulldogs commit Anthony Edwards is only 17, but his skills invite comparisons to multiple NBA standouts.
A local hotel manager fielded calls from fans seeking to fill the handful of rooms available near the arena. Per Chris Leyden of SeatGeek.com, tickets were reselling for an average of $300 on the secondary market, a nearly 200 percent increase from Virginia's average home ticket price.
LeBron James, Rajon Rondo and Rich Paul were all there. Grant Hill, Ralph Sampson Jr. and ESPN's Michael Wilbon were, too. From start to finish, it was the loudest venue I've been to this season.
That Hollywood-like element is an underrated component of Williamson's appeal. No other player in the country can do what he did on Saturday night. The environment that he and his Duke teammates create when they hit the road is the reason NBA teams will do everything they can to secure his services.
We don't know whether Williamson will enjoy a dominant run in the NBA. But the arenas will look, feel and sound like John Paul Jones Arena did on Saturday night wherever he plays next year.
The matchup between Kentucky and Tennessee on Saturday in Lexington will feature some of the most talented players in the country: Grant Williams, Admiral Schofield, PJ Washington, Reid Travis and Keldon Johnson.
Several of those players will be All-Americans at the end of the season. Yep, the depth of both squads could prove to be the most important element of Saturday's game.
Since a loss to Alabama on Jan. 5, Tyler Herro has made 39 percent of his 3-point attempts. And EJ Montgomery and Nick Richards will give Kentucky reinforcements off the bench. Tennessee's John Fulkerson and Derrick Walker have to be ready to contribute, too.
Jordan Bone is averaging 14.5 PPG (50 percent from the 3-point line) over his past four games. He's also committed 16 turnovers in his past five outings, and Ashton Hagans is one of America's best defenders. Losing Yves Pons to a facial injury that could sideline him on Saturday is a problem for the Vols.
This is a rich matchup where the depth of two premier programs will be tested.
This season is stacked with national coach of the year candidates. Some -- Rick Barnes, Mark Few and John Beilein -- have been on the list all season.
But others have emerged in recent weeks. Matt Painter is doing some of his best work with a Purdue team that hasn't lost since Jan. 8. Chris Mack inherited a program that lost four starters, yet Louisville was listed as a top-four seed in the NCAA's initial pairings on Saturday.
Kelvin Sampson's Houston squad might enter the NCAA tournament with one loss.
This season's pool has a multitude of deserving candidates.

2592355,"Editor's note: The NCAA tournament Bubble Watch has been updated through the games of Saturday, Feb. 16.
Put away the jokes about the Southeastern Conference being ""just"" a football conference. These are actually the best of times for SEC hoops.
In fact, the conference is poised to make its biggest splash on the top four seed lines of the NCAA tournament bracket in 17 years. Consider Joe Lunardi's projected bracket.
Lunardi has Tennessee as a No. 1 seed, Kentucky as a No. 2 and LSU on the No. 4 line. If those seeds hold on Selection Sunday, it will mark the SEC's best showing at the top of the bracket since 2002.
The actual bracket is still a month away from being released, of course, but current projections reveal the extent to which the SEC may be rising while other major conferences are in danger of taking a step back.
True, the ACC and Big Ten look about the same as last year in terms of throwing their top-4-seed weight around. But what appears likely is that the SEC's rise in this category is being fueled by significant year-to-year declines recorded by both the Big 12 and the Big East.
The SEC's also performing well in terms of its sheer number of projected bids. After placing eight teams in the NCAA tournament field last spring (an all-time high for the league), the SEC is poised to again send a large contingent into the field of 68.
Granted, repeating the eight-bid performance of 2018 may be a stretch (Florida catching fire would be a big help), but seven teams is looking entirely feasible: Tennessee, Kentucky, LSU, Auburn, Mississippi State, Ole Miss and Alabama. Bear in mind that even a seven-bid performance would mark the SEC's second-best showing since the introduction of the 64-team field in 1986.
Here's how we're projecting the bubble right now....
Bids from traditional ""one-bid"" leagues: 23 teams
Locks: 14 teams
The bubble: 36 teams for 31 available spots

Virginia Tech Hokies 
Virginia Tech's conference opponents are attempting a truly historic number of 3s. Meaning in the history of major-conference play dating back over the last decade and beyond, we've never seen a defense allow this many 3-point attempts. To be sure, this hasn't prevented the Hokies' D from clocking in right at the league average for points allowed per possession. Still, if this potential No. 5 seed is paired with a perimeter-oriented opponent in a March bracket (Villanova?), be aware that the potential exists for opponent-induced 3-point mayhem.
(Updated: Feb. 14)
Florida State Seminoles 
With wins over not only Purdue and LSU but also Louisville, those mid-January losses at Boston College and at Pittsburgh actually loom a bit larger. Indeed, at the time, it seemed like the whole season might go sideways for Leonard Hamilton's men. Instead, those losses are now looking more and more like underachievement from a team whose other defeats came at the hands of Villanova, Virginia and Duke. Florida State's now won seven straight and is cruising toward a No. 6 seed (if not better) with the league's best 2-point FG defense in ACC play. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Syracuse Orange
It's not easy winning road games in the ACC, certainly, but the concern for Syracuse goes beyond a 15-point loss at NC State. The concern is that Jim Boeheim's group, never presumed to be a high-powered offense, is scoring at a rate that's low by even the most modest expectations. In the past three outings, Oshae Brissett, Tyus Battle and their teammates have produced just 0.89 points per possession. Scoring from beyond the arc has been in particularly short supply, and Syracuse has given the ball away on 21 percent of its possessions in those games. To recap, this is a team nominally in line for a No. 8 or 9 seed but one that's also in a scoring slump as it prepares to host Louisville and Duke at the Carrier Dome. There's a lot on the line for the Orange in the coming days. (Updated: Feb. 13)
NC State Wolfpack 
Bubble Watch is on the record as hyping the importance of NC State's current two-game swing. Well, halfway into said swing, Kevin Keatts' men are taking care of business. The Wolfpack beat Syracuse 73-58 in Raleigh, giving this group what could (depending what Clemson does) turn out to be its first win over an eventual NCAA tournament team since it defeated Auburn back in December. Now comes the mother of all ACC opportunities: Duke in Cameron Indoor. Torin Dorn and his teammates are being projected as a No. 9 or 10 seed, but needless to say, a win in Durham this weekend could alter that expectation. (Updated: Feb. 13)
Clemson Tigers
Brad Brownell's team has announced its arrival in Bubble Watch...with back-to-back one-point losses. That can happen. Bubble Watch, like the committee itself, takes the long whole-season view, and losing consecutive nail-biters at Miami and at Louisville is not in itself a deal-breaker. At 5-7 in ACC play but with an eight-point win over Virginia Tech at Littlejohn Coliseum serving as this team's headline statement, the Tigers are projected as a No. 10 or 11 seed. Then again, the loss at the hand of the Hurricanes was Clemson's third Quad 2 defeat of the season. In sum, a 5-7 conference record in mid-February does raise the stakes for looming home dates against Florida State and North Carolina, not to mention upcoming road games against the Quad 2 likes of Pittsburgh and Notre Dame.(Updated: Feb. 16)

Iowa State Cyclones 
The loss at home to TCU was not only surprising, it reduced Iowa State's chances of winning a share of the Big 12 title. In terms of NCAA seeding impact, however, a single defeat at the hands of (one presumes) another at-large team, even at home, isn't going to move the needle all that much. Falling to the Horned Frogs represented the Cyclones' second Quad 2 loss of the season, but Wisconsin also made its way to the No. 4 line in the bracket preview and the Badgers had already lost two Quad 2 games. This isn't a deal-breaker for ISU, just as long as the Clones don't get it into their heads to keep doing this kind of thing. (Updated: Feb. 9)
Kansas State Wildcats 
It is time to ponder whether the team that might (repeat, might) end the incredible 14-year streak of Kansas conference titles might not also be a threat for a really nice seed. One thing we know already is that Kansas State is making opponents uncomfortable. For a second consecutive season, the Wildcats lead the Big 12 in opponent turnover percentage in conference play. That might sound like the mark of a team that's pressing full court and trying to speed up the tempo, but Bruce Weber's guys actually play at the slowest pace in the league. Most importantly, that strategy is working. Kansas State is a projected No. 6 seed right now, but that might not be the end of the story. (Updated: Feb. 12)
Baylor Bears 
Scott Drew's team is still struggling to get healthy and whole. King McClure has now missed three straight games due to an ailing knee, while Makai Mason's been in and out of action while struggling with a toe issue. Both players missed the Bears' 86-61 loss at Texas Tech. Devonte Bandoo has done some heroic work in February trying to fill the absence of two starters with 3-pointers, but a 25-point defeat in Lubbock suggests Drew needs McClure and Mason back sooner rather than later. The population of teams in a strong Big 12 that can beat a shorthanded version of a projected No. 8 seed like Baylor is fairly large. (Updated: Feb. 16)
TCU Horned Frogs 
In a Big 12 that's hardly lacking for good defense, TCU is trending toward being the exception to that rule. Indeed, among the league's eight teams that are playing for NCAA tournament position, the Horned Frogs are the outlier on D, allowing 1.08 points per possession in conference play. That's not an outlandish figure, but TCU's interior defense in particular is looking shaky. The Big 12's converted 54 percent of its 2-pointers against the Frogs, and, in Oklahoma's nine-point win in Fort Worth, Kristian Doolittle lit up Jamie Dixon's guys to the tune of 21 points on 8-of-11 shooting inside the arc. If TCU does land around the No. 8 line as expected, a top seed could find the paint to its liking on offense in the round of 32. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Texas Longhorns 
Call it luck, karma or toughness in crunch time, but Texas looks stronger statistically than your ordinary 7-6 Big 12 team. Those six losses, by the way, have come by a combined 27 points. The Longhorns are expected to draw something in the neighborhood of a No. 9 seed, and this group could definitely give a top seed a game in the round of 32. With a neutral-floor win over North Carolina to their credit (not to mention wins at home over Purdue and Kansas), Shaka Smart's men make up possibly the most dangerous 15-11 team you've ever seen. Yes, that's a non sequitur. Sometimes those are true. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Oklahoma Sooners 
To this point in calendar year 2019, OU has defeated one at-large-quality opponent, and, now, the Sooners have done so twice. In earning the season sweep over TCU, Lon Kruger's men looked more impressive than they have at any point in the conference season. Oklahoma threw a stingy zone defense at the Horned Frogs in Schollmaier Arena, and the visitors cruised to a71-62 win. OU's still very much in double-digit seed territory (this is, after all, a team that's 4-9 in the Big 12 and 16-10 overall), but, for the first time in a long time, the Sooners look capable of playing in a manner that will keep them in the bracket.

Few coaches talk a better woe-are-we game than Jay Wright. By that, of course, Bubble Watch refers to the art of talking like you or your team isn't very good even though you or your team is in fact very good. The coach who has won two of the past three national titles has been at it again this month (""We're not a great team. We're just trying to keep getting better""), and it's true that this group of Wildcats is no match for what we saw a year ago. Nevertheless, presumptive 2019 No. 5 seed Villanova is doing highly impressive and indeed game-changing work in the area of shot volume. In particular, the Wildcat program can boast a ridiculously low, league-leading turnover percentage in Big East play for a second consecutive season.

""Welcome back to another episode of 'We swept Marquette.' We're your hosts, the St. John's Red Storm. We just won a home game against Butler, 77-73 in overtime. John Gasaway would probably say that's not that big a deal, but losing certainly would have been. Now we're up to .500 in Big East play, showing up in the mock brackets as a No. 9 seed and getting ready to host Villanova at the Garden this weekend. Sounds like we could be moving up to 'should be in' very soon. Join us again next time, and remember: We swept Marquette."" (Updated: Feb. 12)
Seton Hall Pirates 
Myles Powell was apparently tired of Markus Howard getting all the attention for high-volume scoring in the Big East. The junior went off for 30 points, punctuated by 10-of-10 shooting at the line, as Seton Hall cruised past Georgetown 90-75 in Newark. Just two weeks removed from a four-game losing streak, the Pirates are back to .500 in conference play, thanks to victories at home over Creighton and the Hoyas. That said, no team projected as a No. 12 seed can feel too comfortable, and this weekend's game against the Bluejays in Omaha could be tougher than it looks. Greg McDermott's team carries a 4-8 record in the Big East, but three of those losses came in overtime. (Updated: Feb. 13)
Butler Bulldogs 
At 5-7 in Big East play after an overtime loss at St. John's and with its marquee neutral-floor win over Florida looking less marquee with each passing week, Butler badly needs to refurbish its profile. The Bulldogs have road games remaining at Marquette and Villanova, and a win in at least one of those contests is now looking more or less essential for a team listed as ""first four out"" by Lunardi.

Wisconsin Badgers 
Life is brutal at the top of the Big Ten. Ethan Happ has scored 38 points and pulled down 23 rebounds in the past two games, and all that got Wisconsin was losses to Michigan and Michigan State. Nick Ward was particularly effective on Happ for the Spartans, forcing the Badgers senior into six turnovers and making him take 20 shots to get his 20 points. Now Greg Gard's team, which is 0-2 since it was tapped as a No. 4 seed in the NCAA's bracket preview, gets a welcome six days of rest before returning to the court at home against Illinois. (Updated: Feb. 12)
Maryland Terrapins 
If you've watched Maryland this season, you've likely been told this is one of the youngest teams in the country. That is indeed correct, and it helps explain both how good this team is and how great it could become. As one would expect from a youthful group, the Terrapins have suffered from an exceedingly large turnover disparity in Big Ten play. Take turnovers out of that equation, however, and Bruno Fernando, Anthony Cowan and company can play with, literally, anyone. In the Terps' 13-point loss at Michigan, for example, this young team that's a presumed No. 6 seed actually came close (1.08 points per no-turnover possession) to matching the Wolverines (1.10) on turnover-neutral scoring. The fact that Maryland committed 16 turnovers while UM had just six, however, translated into a double-digit margin of defeat. (Updated Feb. 16)
Iowa Hawkeyes 
If you paused in hitting ""refresh"" on this page, you know the Iowa writeup before this one waxed eloquent on how the Hawkeyes don't have any truly bad losses. Well, that's still true, but, man, did Iowa come close. Fran McCaffery's guys needed a last-second 3 from Jordan Bohannon to escape with an 80-79 win at home over Northwestern. Absent the Hawkeyes' amazing rally from 11 down with 2 minutes, 5 seconds remaining, the Wildcats would have handed the home team a Quad 2 loss. Instead, Iowa's profile is still unblemished by anything close to that. Well done, Hawkeyes. Your projected No. 6 seed is looking solid after all. (Updated: Feb. 10)
Ohio State Buckeyes
A 63-56 loss at home to Illinois constitutes a Quad 3 defeat for Ohio State, the team's first such setback. In other words, the game is literally the Buckeyes' worst loss of the season in profile terms. Then again, Baylor's walking around whistling a happy tune in the brackets as a projected No. 8 seed even though the Bears have suffered two Quad 4 losses. Meaning the worry for OSU isn't necessarily the loss itself, one that this team's profile can well absorb. (Yet another reason why that win at Cincinnati is so valuable.) Rather, the concern is whether the outcome marks a new turn for the worse in performance. (Updated: Feb. 15)
Minnesota Golden Gophers 
When last we checked in on the Gophers, Bubble Watch had this to say: ""Minnesota is a 6-8 Big Ten team being shown as a No. 11 seed in mid-February. Everything in that sentence fairly screams, 'Win some games.'"" The good news for Richard Pitino's men is that they are now a 7-8 Big Ten team being shown as a No. 11 seed after they thrashed Indiana 84-63 at Williams Arena. Now the table's set for the big one: Michigan's coming to the Twin Cities, and a win there, paired with the road victory the Gophers already recorded at Wisconsin, would push this team a long way toward ""should be in"" status. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Indiana Hoosiers 
You're wondering why an Indiana team that's 4-10 in the Big Ten and has lost 10 of its last 11 is still here after losing by 21 on the road to a Minnesota team that is itself kind of bubbly. That's easy. The Hoosiers are here because they started that game as proud members of a number of reputable mock brackets. IU was able to attain that status, of course, because that 11th game in the recent stretch was, incredibly, a win at Michigan State. Pair that with victories against Marquette and Louisville, and you have a profile that could get you in the field of 68 if Indiana decides to start winning games. But, right now, the Hoosiers really don't look like they're going to decide to start winning games.(Updated: Feb. 16)

Work to do: Arizona State
Washington Huskies 
Now we know that Washington won't run the table in the Pac-12. The loss at Arizona State means Mike Hopkins' men will likely reach Selection Sunday showing road victories at Arizona and Oregon as their best wins. This is still the Pac-12's best per-possession team by a healthy margin, one that's likely to post a gaudy record in conference play. All of that might well result in a seed in the middle of the bracket and, consequently, a game against a very high seed in the round of 32. (Updated: Feb. 9)
Arizona State Sun Devils 
Recording a 77-73 loss at Colorado qualifies as a Quad 2 defeat, so, no, that's not ideal for an Arizona State team straddling the line between ""last four byes"" and plain old ""last four in."" But hey, this is Arizona State we're talking about. Losing in Boulder is the least extreme thing this team has done in days. Whether you're speaking of the 21-point Quad 4 loss at home to Washington State or the ensuing 75-63 win over Washington in Tempe, the Sun Devils do nothing halfway. Bottom line, ASU would likely be in, barely, if the selection were held today. Absent the most extreme string of either wins or losses in the arid Quad 1-free savanna known as the Pac-12, the Sun Devils could remain in this state of bubbly uncertainty for the foreseeable future.

LSU Tigers 
Remember last season (and several seasons before that) when it seemed as if Kansas won every single close game that it played? That crunch-time magic has somehow been replicated in Baton Rouge in 2019. LSU did lose a nail-biter at home to Arkansas, but the Tigers are 6-1 overall in SEC games decided by single digits. Most impressively, Will Wade's men brought their 40th minute mastery to hallowed Rupp Arena and came away with a somewhat controversial but nevertheless impressive 73-71 win over Kentucky. The Tigers are the only visiting team that has won a game in Lexington this season. That, plus a 10-1 SEC record, could presage an even higher seed in the bracket than the currently projected No. 4 line for Wade's group. (Updated: Feb. 12)
Mississippi State Bulldogs 
No team has done more with a sub.-500 conference record than MSU, which is 5-6 in the SEC but popping up as a No. 7 seed in mock brackets. Well, there's a reason for that. The Bulldogs have more Quad 1 wins (six) than they do SEC wins. Ben Howland's team will get the chance to add to both win totals, of course, when it plays on the road in the coming weeks at Arkansas, Auburn and Tennessee. Meanwhile, Quinndary Weatherspoon is continuing to do a pretty fair imitation of Buddy Hield by displaying uncommon accuracy all over the court, on 2s, 3s and free throws alike. (Updated: Feb. 12)
Auburn Tigers 
The knock on the Tigers is that that they're an efficient bunch beloved of laptops but that, oh by the way, Auburn doesn't actually beat any good teams. Bruce Pearl's men are just 2-5 against SEC opponents listed as locks, should-be in's or work-to-do's by Bubble Watch, and the wins came at home against Alabama and Florida. AU won't get a chance to change its ""all stats, no statements"" reputation until it plays at Kentucky next weekend. In the meantime, a team that's being shown as anything from a No. 7 to a No. 9 seed would be well advised to take care of business mid-week at home against Arkansas.(Updated: Feb. 13)
Ole Miss Rebels
Ole Miss has what might be the cleanest profile an 18-7 team could construct for itself. Every one of those seven losses, for example, falls under the heading of Quad 1. Plus the Rebels now own road wins not only against Auburn but also at Mississippi State. If Kermit Davis and his men emerge at 20-7 after this current take-care-of-business interlude (Ole Miss won at home against Missouri and will now visit South Carolina before returning to Oxford to play Georgia), we may be envisioning the Rebels as something a step up from a No. 8 seed. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Alabama Crimson Tide 
As a genre that has proliferated over the last decade or so, the bubble watch typically exists to overreact to the most recent game played. Naturally, we here capital B and W Bubble Watch would never stoop to such hackery, so you can trust us when we say Alabama's most recent game was aberrantly damaging to the Crimson Tide's bracket position. Avery Johnson's team entered its home game against Florida as a projected No. 10 seed, but losing 71-53 in Tuscaloosa to an opponent that started the contest 13-11 and ranked No. 40 in the NET does you no seeding favors. Alabama would still likely make the tournament if the selection were held today. (Updated: Feb. 16)
Florida Gators 
Look who's still hanging around in ""first four out"" territory. The Gators are now 14-11 and 6-6 in SEC play, not numbers that necessarily translate seamlessly into ""at-large."" Then again, this is also a group with two Quad 1 wins (at Arkansas and at Alabama) and a NET ranking that's been hovering in the 30s and 40s. The 18-point victory at Tuscaloosa was, easily, the Gators' most complete performance of the conference season and could not have come at a better time. LSU is up next, in Baton Rouge.

Cincinnati Bearcats
Mick Cronin's team went scoreless over the final 6:11 of the game and lost 65-58 at Houston. Jarron Cumberland scored 27 points for UC (albeit on 25 shots), but it was not to be. The outcome represents a lost chance to earn a higher seed, far and away the best single opportunity the Bearcats will get before Selection Sunday. Then again, there's no shortage of teams in the American or, indeed, nationally, that would gladly switch places with a group cruising toward something in the neighborhood of a No. 7 seed. (Updated: Feb. 10)
UCF Knights
Give UCF credit. The Knights have shown an unmistakable ability to cling tenaciously to what's supposed to be a precarious spot: the very bottom of the at-large field. According to Joe Lunardi, Johnny Dawkins' team would be one of the last teams in the field not sent to Dayton if the season ended today. That status is holding steady after UCF took care of South Florida at home 78-65. The Knights will get the opportunity to strengthen their hold on an at-large bid thanks to two remaining games against Cincinnati and one at Houston. First up, however, is a home date against Memphis. (Updated: Feb. 13)
Temple Owls
Speaking of the very bottom of the at-large field, Temple is moving in somewhat the same bubble circles as UCF. The Knights have the superior NET ranking (in the 40s, versus the 50-something rank carried by the Owls), but of course, it's Fran Dunphy's men who have the win to end all American wins: Houston's only loss of the season came against Temple on Jan. 9 in the Liacouras Center. One potential worry for the Owls, however, is that barring an encounter in the conference tournament, their games against the Cougars and the Bearcats are already in the books. There'll be no more regular-season chances at the biggest wins in the conference. Then again, Temple and UCF meet head-to-head in the last game of the season in Philadelphia. That showdown could have a bubble implication or three. (Updated: Feb. 13)

Nevada Wolf Pack
Eric Musselman went after Pac-12 opponents in making his 2018-19 schedule, and, well, that league isn't having its best season. The dip in what was supposed to be major-conference opponent strength explains why Nevada is currently being projected as a No. 4 seed with a 21-1 record. It also accounts for the fact that Musselman's team has yet to play a Quad 1 game this season. That will change, at last, when the Wolf Pack visit Utah State at the beginning of next month.

Buffalo Bulls 
Congratulations, Bulls. You navigated what on paper looked to be a challenging two-game road swing and came away passing with flying colors. Wins at Akron and at Toledo mean Nate Oats' team now has a realistic shot at winning out the rest of the way. Running the table would give Buffalo a 16-2 record in the MAC, but even dropping a game along the way, as UB already did at Northern Illinois and at Bowling Green, wouldn't wreck a profile that includes a win at Syracuse. UB appears to be heading for something in the neighborhood of a No. 7 seed.

Wofford Terriers
The Southern Conference has never sent an at-large team to the NCAA tournament, but there's a first time for everything. Wofford is in this discussion because the Terriers are 22-4, with the losses coming to North Carolina, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mississippi State. Mike Young's team additionally own Quad 1 wins at UNC Greensboro and East Tennessee State. Finally, it's worth noting Wofford won at South Carolina by 20, even though that shows up on the profile as a Quad 2 victory. (Updated: Feb. 15)
VCU Rams
If Bubble Watch is correct to be bullish on how well a somewhat underrated Texas team might perform the rest of the way, the correctness will be good news for VCU. Any impressive exploits yet to be recorded by the Longhorns can only add luster to the tournament profile of a Rams team that went to Austin on Dec. 5 and came away with a 54-53 win. (Feast your eyes, the score itself says ""hard-fought."") Will that profile be enough to get Mike Rhoades' team an at-large bid? Quite possibly, but make no mistake, recent selection history doesn't furnish too many feel-good precedents. It's likely to be a close call. (Updated: Feb. 13)

25916301,"Brown's nephew confirmed the death. Details were not immediately available.
Brown officiated in four of UCLA's Final Fours in the 1960s and '70s. He forged strong working relationships with everyone from Bob Knight to Dick Vitale, who tweeted that Brown had the whistle for his last appearance as a coach in the NCAA tournament in 1977.
Brown was a fixture on talk radio in Denver, working with longtime partner Joe Williams on shows that spanned four decades.
He also coached baseball at Colorado before that program was shut down in 1980. Always quick with a quip, he once said: ""I made CU baseball what it is today. Extinct.""
Brown was in the booth for ESPN's first college football telecast, a game between Colorado and Oregon in 1979.
""ESPN is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Denver legend, Irv Brown,"" the company said in a statement Sunday. ""A pioneer in sports talk radio for more than four decades, he contributed to a variety of live events on ESPN in the company's formative years. He will be missed by listeners and colleagues alike.""

25979854,"Zion who? Ja Morant, an AAU pal of Duke's Zion Williamson, has taken college hoops by storm with his viral dunks. But he's more than his highlights. Morant leads the Ohio Valley Conference in points per game (23.9) and the country in assists per game (10.2). His coach, Matt McMahon, said he noticed right away that the 6-foot-3 point guard was special.
But can a barely recruited kid from Murray State really dominate March and then make it at the next level? We asked an NBA scout to assess Morant ... then had Morant assess that assessment.
Next up for Morant: A big-time showdown with fellow Ohio Valley front-runner Austin Peay on Thursday (9 p.m. ET on ESPN2).
The scout
""Morant has great explosiveness and athleticism -- I can see why he's compared to Russell Westbrook (1). He has a thin frame, but he'll easily bulk up. I like his aggressiveness and attacking mentality. He really finishes at the rim and uses all dribbles to gain an advantage (2). He sees the floor very well, has a great handle, and he's unselfish (3). His 3-point shooting [33 percent] is not a red flag; I don't see anything wrong with his form, and that's one of the easiest skills to improve in the NBA (4). On defense, he's often not in a stance and flat-footed. He's got great hands and causes deflections, but that's not enough for the next level. He should be better on defense with his physical skills (5). Morant is a definite top-10 pick, and he could be top-three.""
Morant
1) ""Westbrook is my favorite player and who I try to model my game after -- the aggressiveness, the chip on his shoulder. That's how I play, just from being under the radar and really trying to work hard to get to where I'm at.""
2) ""I try not to take a lot of dribbles. I look to attack almost on every dribble, just reading the defender's body and looking to get to my spot on the floor.""
3) ""I really love sharing the ball. Just to see my teammates succeed. If there's any time I can [help teammates succeed], I will. I look to pass the ball before I look to score.""
4) ""I feel like I'm a good shooter. But sometimes in a game, when I settle, that's when I miss a shot instead of just playing in rhythm. Most of the shots I miss are forced.""
5) ""Some of my defensive mistakes are because of fatigue from playing a lot of minutes. I have to get more locked in and get some breaks on the offensive end to catch my breath.""

25961918,"In a series of statements released Friday through her attorney, Meredith Watson said a former Duke basketball player raped her in 1999. Watson also has said that Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax sexually assaulted her on Duke's campus in Durham, North Carolina, when they were both students in 2000.
The identity of the men's basketball player facing the allegation is not known.
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said both he and the university understand the severity of the matter.
""I think there was an allegation made, right?"" Krzyzewski said after Saturday night's victory at Virginia. ""So, I'm not sure that's true or not, but there's an allegation. I didn't find out about it until late last night, and I have no knowledge about it. ... Our university will take care of whatever actions and give whatever information that's needed to be done. I think our [athletic director] has put out a statement that we'll give to you. It's very ... something like that is serious. So, our school looks at it that way, and we'll do whatever we can to make sure that we answer whatever questions are posed to us.""
Duke distributed a statement after the Virginia game, detailing its intent to investigate the claims.
""Duke first learned of the allegations involving a student-athlete last night when they were reported by the media,"" the statement said. ""Coach Krzyzewski confirms that he had no knowledge of the alleged conduct from 1999. The university is looking into the matter and will have no further comment at this time.""
The 1998-99 Duke team was one of the most talented and highly touted teams in school history. It lost to UConn in the national title game that season.
""Ms. Watson was raped by a basketball player during her sophomore year at Duke,"" a portion of Watson's statement read. ""She went to the Dean, who provided no help and discouraged her from pursuing the claim further. Ms. Watson also told friends, including Justin Fairfax.""
Watson is the second woman to allege that Fairfax sexually assaulted her. Fairfax has been urged by leaders to step down.
The allegations against Fairfax are attached to one of the most turbulent weeks in the history of Virginia politics. Gov. Ralph Northam admitted to wearing blackface after a racially incendiary photo in his medical school yearbook surfaced. The state's attorney general, Mark Herring, also has admitted to donning blackface in the past.
Northam has refused to step down, despite demands from his peers and adversaries who want him to leave his post.
Fairfax was expected to succeed Northam if he had decided to step down.

25930674,"Well, we'll take a stab at it, giving you both sides of the argument: the case for keeping a coach and the case for replacing him. And we'll leave it up to you from there.
What his detractors would say: Not many high-major head coaches get eight seasons at the same school without making the NCAA tournament -- and Penn State isn't going to come close this season. The Nittany Lions enter Tuesday with just one Big Ten victory and are going to finish at the bottom of the standings. They've never finished above .500 in the conference during Chambers' tenure.
Why his firing would be unjust: There were clear signs of progress last season, beating Ohio State three times to earn a spot on the NCAA tournament bubble and then winning the NIT. Chambers signed a contract extension last spring to keep him until 2022; why even give that in the first place if one down season after losing Tony Carr was going to seal his fate? This isn't an easy job; the Nittany Lions have been to the NCAA tournament four times since 1965. -- Jeff Borzello
What his detractors would say: Christian has one .500-plus season at Boston College (2017-18). This season's team has won just two games since Dec. 22. Athletic director Martin Jarmond, who arrived in 2017 and did not hire Christian, might be interested in putting his stamp on the program by recruiting his preferred candidate.
Why his firing would be unjust: Coaches are charged with developing elite talent, and last year, Jerome Robinson was the school's highest draft pick since 1982. Christian is navigating through a tough league with multiple national title contenders, too. Not easy to do. And because of injuries, only three players on this season's roster have participated in all 22 games. -- Myron Medcalf
What his detractors would say: It has been a truly dreadful season for the Green Wave. They haven't won a conference game yet, and lost nonconference games to the likes of South Alabama, Southeastern Louisiana, Towson and Alabama A&M. They've won eight American Athletic Conference games total in three seasons. Dunleavy will be 65 in March; maybe he's just not cut out for college.
Why his firing would be unjust: What did you expect when he was hired? Dunleavy had never coached a minute of college basketball before the Green Wave made the call. And he took over a program that went 3-15 in the league the season before. There were some positive signs last season, and he has had some success on the recruiting trail since taking over. -- Jeff Borzello
What his detractors would say: It's pretty simple: The Broncos haven't won a game in the Mid-American Conference this season. They're 0-10 heading into Tuesday. Although Western Michigan has been competitive for most of Hawkins' tenure, the Broncos have gone to the NCAA tournament only twice in 16 seasons and have finished .500 or below in MAC play in three of the past four seasons.
Why his firing would be unjust: Hawkins and the Broncos won the West Division title two seasons ago and have won at least 20 games in seven of his 16 seasons at the helm. This season's 0-10 league start is terrible, yes, but this will be just the fourth season since Hawkins took over that Western Michigan will finish below .500 in league play. What's the rush? -- Jeff Borzello
What his detractors would say: It's simple, really. Jones just hasn't won enough games. Rather than conduct an exhaustive national search, the school handed him the job after Cuonzo Martin left for Missouri two years ago. But this outcome is even worse than anticipated for a team that has lost to Seattle, UC-Riverside, Chaminade and Central Arkansas under Jones.
Why his firing would be unjust: Money is a problem for Cal, which invested nearly $500 million in a football stadium renovation that will tie the school up in massive debt payments for decades. According to Bloomberg, the school's debt payments will rise to $37 million per year beginning in 2039. Jones makes $1 million per season, a below-average sum for a Power 5 coach. Cal might not have the cash to pay a replacement for Jones. -- Myron Medcalf
What his detractors would say: A disastrous third season for Joseph, who won 20 games after replacing Mike Lonergan as an interim head coach in 2016, has turned into a free fall. George Washington, which is 7-16 overall, has one of the worst offenses in America, and it entered the week ranked 251st in the NCAA Evaluation Tool.
Why his firing would be unjust: He helped this program salvage its reputation after Lonergan was dismissed for his alleged verbal abuse of players. That has to count for something. And he's only 33. When Mike Krzyzewski was 33, he finished 10-17 in his second season at Duke and then 11-17 a year later. Maybe Joseph just needs more time. -- Myron Medcalf
What his detractors would say: There were the Sweet 16 appearances in 2016 and 2018 ... and nothing else. The Aggies have missed the NCAA tournament in five of Kennedy's seven seasons in College Station, and they're certainly not getting there this season. A&M is 2-8 in the league and 9-13 overall entering Tuesday, with a 15-point home loss to Texas Southern back in December. There's too much talent in the state of Texas and on the current roster to be toward the bottom of the SEC.
Why his firing would be unjust: We just said it. The guy has been to two of the past three Sweet 16s. The Aggies are in the midst of a down season after losing three starters to the NBA draft and another to a season-ending injury. It's hard to fault Kennedy for that. Throw in the fact A&M is bringing in a top-20 recruiting class next season while also having just one senior on this season's roster, and the Aggies should be poised for a turnaround. -- Jeff Borzello
What his detractors would say: We're not asking him to be Tony Bennett, but come on, at least be competitive in a bad Pac-12. The Cougars haven't finished with more than seven conference wins since Kent took over and haven't come close to finishing .500 overall. He has won 20 total conference games in four-plus seasons. The former athletic director parted ways with Ken Bone after five seasons, and Bone had a couple of competitive seasons in there.
Why his firing would be unjust: Did you not see this past weekend? Washington State went on the road and swept the Arizona schools. The Cougars have arguably the best player in the league in Robert Franks. Kent is signed through 2022, and really, who is going to come to Pullman and have consistent success right off the bat? It's not an easy job. -- Jeff Borzello
What his detractors would say: The Sycamores are sitting in a tie for last place in the Missouri Valley Conference this season, their fourth consecutive season in the bottom half of the league and the fourth in a row below .500 in conference play. They haven't finished with an overall winning record since the 2013-14 season, and Lansing saw his automatic contract rollover canceled back in 2017.
Why his firing would be unjust: Before the past four seasons, he was one of the better coaches in the Missouri Valley. The Sycamores went to the NCAA tournament in his first season in charge and finished .500 or better in the league in four of his first five seasons. It's important to keep in mind that during Lansing's first few years, there was a Creighton-Wichita State hegemony atop the league -- that factors into his overall record -- but both schools have moved on. -- Jeff Borzello
What his detractors would say: He won nine, nine and 11 games in three previous seasons, without a hint of NCAA tournament consideration. And that problem is secondary to the testimony in federal court by Brian Bowen Sr., who alleged that assistant Shane Heirman and a grassroots program formerly run by fellow assistant Tim Anderson both paid him thousands of dollars for the services of his son, Brian Bowen Jr. Leitao's losses and his hiring decisions could help end his time at DePaul.
Why his firing would be unjust: C'mon, man. Leitao's squad is 13-9 entering Tuesday and 5-6 in the Big East after a two-game win streak. Plus, he has signed a top-25 recruiting class anchored by Romeo Weems and Markese Jacobs. This could be the class that changes things for DePaul. -- Myron Medcalf
What his detractors would say: After an NCAA tournament at Tulsa, more was expected from Manning. Instead, the Demon Deacons have sandwiched four awful seasons around a First Four appearance in 2017. They're 2-8 in the ACC this season and lost to the likes of Houston Baptist and Gardner-Webb at home in the nonconference season. They're sliding further and further behind the rest of the ACC.
Why his firing would be unjust: The talent is there. Manning is recruiting quality players to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, led by five-star Jaylen Hoard in 2018 and two other ESPN 100 players in the past three classes. Also, Manning signed an extension in 2017 that keeps him at the school through 2025 -- and it's fully guaranteed. It's going to take a lot of money to make a move and still hire a high-level replacement. -- Jeff Borzello
What his detractors would say: Do you see what's going on in Reno? UNLV has taken a back seat to its in-state rival. Nevada has been getting better high school players and better transfers -- and is ranked in the top 10 nationally. Menzies has failed to even get the Runnin' Rebels in a conference title race in his first three seasons.
Why his firing would be unjust: One, it has been just short of three seasons. Two, it hasn't been that bad in Vegas. The Runnin' Rebels are above .500 in the Mountain West this season and have improved tremendously since an 11-21 (4-14 in the MWC) debut season for Menzies. They won 20 games last season, for crying out loud. It's a different Mountain West than it was five to 10 years ago; it's a one-team league for now, but that team won't always be Nevada. -- Jeff Borzello
What his detractors would say: He has gone from the fun coach who used to tweet at halftime to the coach whose team has experienced high turnover and won more than 20 games only once. Nebraska, which has reached the NCAA tournament only once under Miles, has lost seven in a row. Plus, Nebraska can shred the final year of his deal by paying him a $2.5 million buyout this offseason. The school would owe Miles nearly $4 million total if it made the move after next season.
Why his firing would be unjust: Nebraska has opened a great arena and practice facility within the past five years. The school has invested millions to rebrand itself as a viable basketball program. That's not easy to do for a program that's never won an NCAA tournament game. Firing Miles could erase the momentum the program has built during his time in Lincoln. -- Myron Medcalf
What his detractors would say: Well, this one is easy. Three of Miller's former assistants (Mark Phelps, Book Richardson and Joe Pasternack) have been connected to significant violations that could lead to hefty penalties for the program. That, coupled with the fact that Miller has never reached the Final Four despite securing multiple elite recruiting classes, could become justification for his dismissal at season's end.
Why his firing would be unjust: He's still here. After an ESPN report last season tied him to an alleged pay-for-play scheme involving Deandre Ayton, the school and its key supporters backed him. Those backers seem content to dismiss anyone but Miller, who has ESPN's No. 1 recruiting class for 2019 in spite of the issues surrounding the program. He has also won 76 percent of his games as head coach in Tucson. Why would the school fire him now when it has fought so hard to keep him? -- Myron Medcalf
What his detractors would say: Monson hasn't led Long Beach State to a Big West tournament championship since 2012 or a conference regular-season title since 2013. He took a $75,000 pay cut in the offseason after facing scrutiny for his unique contract, which last season allowed him to rack up more than $300,000 from nonconference buy games. Monson's team is 1-6 in its past seven games after back-to-back losing seasons under the 57-year-old leader.
Why his firing would be unjust: Monson, who has been with Long Beach State since the 2007-08 season, when he won just six games, is the face of that program. His team has been able to schedule nonconference games against America's best teams based on his ties within the business. And before last season, he hadn't finished lower than fourth in league play since his first season on campus. -- Myron Medcalf
What his detractors would say: John Hardt, Richmond's athletic director, wouldn't address Mooney's status last week. ""This is not the time,"" he told reporters. ""The focus right now is on the team and competing on the court."" That's not a favorable response for a coach who hasn't reached the NCAA tournament since 2011's Sweet 16 run and has a 4-7 record in the Atlantic 10 this season.
Why his firing would be unjust: Few coaches can match his consistency. Before last season's tumultuous 12-20 campaign, Mooney hadn't had a losing season since 2007, when he finished 8-22 in the second year of his tenure. His top three scorers this season (Grant Golden, Jacob Gilyard and Nathan Cayo) are all sophomores, too. He can build on this. -- Myron Medcalf
What his detractors would say: The Red Storm have arguably the most talented roster in the Big East this season -- and they're below .500 in the league, fighting for their NCAA tournament lives. They've yet to finish above .500 in the Big East since Mullin took over, and haven't played in a postseason tournament yet. There have been questions about Mullin's commitment level, and on the recruiting front, they haven't been able to keep New York/New Jersey kids home for college.
Why his firing would be unjust: Despite Saturday's loss to Providence, this team is still on track to make the NCAA tournament if the season ended today. Even if Shamorie Ponds leaves for the NBA, the Red Storm will still bring back most of the rotation, and they have three talented transfers sitting out. Athletic director Mike Cragg took over in September; his first order of business is going to be forcing out the school's all-time greatest player? Stop. -- Jeff Borzello
What his detractors would say: Things are going progressively downhill at Rose Hill Gym. After winning 17 games overall and eight Atlantic 10 games in his first season, Neubauer now has the Rams with a 1-9 record in the A-10 and poised for a second consecutive season at the bottom of the standings. And even though basketball in New York City is down compared with what it used to be, the presence of just two players on the roster from New York is surprising.
Why his firing would be unjust: Did you see how it was when Neubauer took over in the Bronx? Tom Pecora had won 13 A-10 games total in five seasons, never winning more than 10 overall in a single season. Neubauer has shown he can win games at Fordham, even if hasn't happened the past two seasons. -- Jeff Borzello
What his detractors would say: Saturday's 20-point road loss to Miami (Ohio), Ohio's chief rival, punctuated a 3-7 start in MAC play for Phillips, who hasn't reached the NCAA tournament with the Bobcats. The Bobcats have had two losing seasons in conference play since 2010 -- both under Phillips, who could endure No. 3 this season and lose his job.
Why his firing would be unjust: He won 43 games from 2015 to 2017, a promising start. He has proved he can win big at Ohio. And two of his best players, Teyvion Kirk and Jason Carter, are underclassmen. The Bobcats are a top-100 defensive team, too. It's not all bad at Ohio. -- Myron Medcalf
What his detractors would say: His first full season as head coach in 2012-13 is the only winning season on his résumé. It was also the only season Air Force finished higher than ninth in the Mountain West during his tenure. This could be Pilipovich's sixth consecutive losing season.
Why his firing would be unjust: It's a difficult, complicated job. And Pilipovich, who has been with Air Force as a head coach or assistant for more than a decade, understands that. He has a growing young point guard in A.J. Walker and a modest 5-6 record in league play. That's better than par for the course in a program with four NCAA tournament appearances in its history. -- Myron Medcalf
What his detractors would say: He has made one trip to the NCAA tournament since he was hired in 2014. That he has even failed to duplicate former coach Tubby Smith's modest success in Minneapolis is a problem for a guy who has had better resources, including an elite practice facility, but no home run recruits. Multiple assistants have left the program. And the stain of Reggie Lynch, who was dismissed last year after facing multiple sexual assault allegations, remains.
Why his firing would be unjust: This isn't Kentucky or Duke in terms of on-court expectations -- Pitino's team might reach the NCAA tournament if it can finish strong. And if that happens, it will be difficult for athletic director Mark Coyle to justify firing Pitino, who has actually become a more likable and approachable figure in the Twin Cities this season. His handling of the recent death of guard Dupree McBrayer's mother gave him an opportunity to display his softer side. -- Myron Medcalf
What his detractors would say: The Owls are headed for another finish in the bottom half of the Atlantic Sun, on Saturday getting just their third win over a Division I team this season. Since arriving in 2015, Skinner hasn't finished above .500 in the league and hasn't won more than 14 games in a season. This is a job you have to grind on the recruiting trail; is Skinner still up for that?
Why his firing would be unjust: The former Boston College and Rhode Island coach has been at the helm for four seasons -- and Skinner has actually been a slight improvement on his predecessors. Jimmy Lallathin went 4-10 in the league in his lone season, and Lewis Preston won five Atlantic Sun games total in three seasons. Before this season, Skinner was 20-22 in league play. It's Kennesaw State; you're really going to fire him over that? -- Jeff Borzello

25945883,"More than 35 years ago, long before the days of cellphones, the internet and cable television (at least for me), Tony and I were connected by a mutual friend, and we hit it off immediately. Two boys from the Carolinas who, in the fall of 1983, found their way to the University of Tennessee and forged a lifelong friendship.
When Tennessee hired Rick Barnes in 2016, did anyone envision the Vols (No. 1 in the country) being here?
And, of course, there was our connection to basketball. We both played in high school, but that was the extent of any hoops comparisons between the two of us. Tony went on to become one of the most prolific scorers in Volunteers hoops lore before playing professionally overseas. I went on to become a reporter and cover college sports. It is a bond that has endured the time and separation that tests most friendships, always finding a way to reconnect.
Given those years of friendship, it was hard not to get emotional when I recently accompanied Tony to address the current Tennessee men's basketball team.
""The Wizard"" is facing the fight of his life.
I learned of Tony's cancer diagnosis from one of his former teammates at Tennessee. A close mutual friend, Anthony Richardson (Slim Dog to those of us who know him best), was coming to town that weekend and heard Tony was in the hospital. After Anthony relayed the information, we all met at the hospital.
Tony entered the hospital on Sept. 18, 2018, the first of nearly 100 nights he has collectively spent at UT Medical Center. He received the cancer diagnosis, acute myeloid leukemia M5, the next day and immediately began 30 days of inpatient chemotherapy. In all, he has undergone four rounds of chemotherapy, is extremely susceptible to any kind of infection and has been confined to a hospital bed for much of the past five months.
It was sobering to see our buddy in such a weakened state and hooked up to all those machines in the hospital.
But ask anyone who tried to guard Tony back in the day. He might be 6-foot-2 and 175 pounds soaking wet, but he attacked the rim like he was 6-foot-9 and 275 pounds. And that's the way he is attacking this disease.
""Full-court press, baby,"" Tony said to me with that familiar toothy grin.
That's been his mantra ever since receiving the diagnosis, but it has pretty much been his mantra his entire life. The skinny kid out of Independence High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, wasn't offered a scholarship by Duke, North Carolina or NC State and instead came across the Smoky Mountains to carve out a legendary career at Tennessee. And it was a Charlotte basketball enthusiast, Sam Reavis, who reached out to a contact inside the Tennessee basketball office and made the staff aware of Tony's talent.
""And what a blessing it's been,"" said Tony, who grew up in a two-bedroom apartment in inner-city Charlotte with four other siblings and didn't regularly sleep in his own bed until he got to college.
As fiercely competitive as Tony was on the court, he loved just being himself when we were in school. That's what made our relationship so much fun. While we talked hoops -- and, yes, he's still peeved about some of those calls he didn't get in Rupp Arena and Memorial Gymnasium -- we also talked about all the frivolous things 19- and 20-year-old college kids typically talk about. We'd make our weekly Sunday night pilgrimage to Captain D's because all of the cafeterias on campus were closed or do our best impersonations of Don DeVoe, Tony's old coach at Tennessee.
DeVoe's voice is unmistakable, and Tony still has it down pat. ""Ball, you, man, Tony. See the ball,"" ... Tony would start laughing before finishing the impersonation.
Tony would call me ""Home Boy"" when we were in school because of our Carolina roots. I worked for the UT student newspaper, The Daily Beacon, and it was always interesting to see the looks on some of the reporters' faces when Tony would greet me with his customary ""Home Boy"" in the interview room after games.
It seems surreal, but it was 32 years ago to the date -- Feb. 14, 1987 -- that Tony set Tennessee's single-game scoring record with 51 points in a 103-84 victory against Auburn. I was there that night in the old Stokely Athletics Center to see Tony put on a scoring exhibition with an array of pull-up jumpers, his patented spin move and an 18-of-19 performance from the free throw line.
(And, in the spirit of full disclosure, I was also there for the postgame celebration down on the Cumberland Avenue strip. Thankfully, there was no such thing as social media or camera phones back then, although it was Tony who mostly kept me out of trouble, instead of the other way around.)
He went on to graduate as the second-leading scorer in Tennessee basketball history and was named the SEC's Player of the Year in 1987.
From the time I first met Tony, the one thing that matched his incredible scoring prowess was his humility. The two-time SEC scoring leader agreed to play on my team during the annual Lambda Chi Alpha 3-on-3 basketball tournament one spring.
Just picture this: Tony going at it on an old rundown outdoor court behind what was then the Lambda Chi Alpha house with a bunch of frat guys, Tennessee football players and regular students ... and loving every bit of it.
But, then, that's Tony in a nutshell. It's why he has endeared himself to so many, namely this current Tennessee basketball team that's making the kind of waves that take Vol fans back to the ""Ernie and Bernie Show"" days of the mid-1970s when Ernie Grunfeld and Bernard King were the toast of Knoxville.
""Tony is family and somebody who's made an impact on all of us,"" Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said. ""We're right there with him in his fight and blessed that he's part of our lives.""
Barnes, a North Carolina boy himself, has been to UT Medical Center multiple times to visit Tony, and several other current and former players have visited or checked in with him in some capacity. Grant Williams, Dale Ellis, Michael Brooks, Gary Carter, Chris Lofton, Reggie Johnson, Steve Ray, Mark Griffin, Fred Jenkins and Clarence Swearengen, to name a few. Tennessee athletic director and former head football coach Phillip Fulmer has also visited.
Anthony Richardson, Tony's roommate at the old Gibbs Hall athletic dorm, made a special trip up from Atlanta this past weekend, and we watched the Florida-Tennessee basketball game together at my house.
""A lot of those guys I didn't even play with, and some I haven't seen in a long time, but Tennessee basketball is a brotherhood, and Coach Barnes has helped make that brotherhood even stronger,"" Tony said. ""To see what he's done with the program and the way he's done it makes us all proud to be a part of it.""
There is an old sign inside Tennessee's basketball offices commemorating Tony's 51-point performance, and Barnes plans to present that sign to Tony for him to keep. Williams, one of the best players in the country, recently told Tony he was going to take that sign (and the record) from him at some point, to which Tony shot back, ""You can't stay in the game long enough to break that record.""
Williams has battled foul trouble at times this season, and Tony scolded him about committing ill-advised infractions when Williams visited him in the hospital.
""Man, we need you in there at the end. Let those silly fouls go,"" Tony barked playfully at Williams, who fouled out and didn't play in the overtime period in the Vols' only loss of the season, to Kansas in November.
Of course, a few nights after Tony visited with the team before the Alabama game, Williams made a run at the record when he poured in a career-high 43 points in the 88-83 overtime win against Vanderbilt. One of the first things Williams did after that game was to give a shout-out to Tony during the postgame news conference.
""I thought about him during the night and told him I was going to try and break his scoring record one day,"" said Williams, who is also from Charlotte. ""I didn't get there, but I just wanted to show him some love. I wanted to do something special for him.""
The only Tennessee player in the past 50 years to score more points in a single game than Williams' 43 was White during the 1986-87 season when he scored 49 against Florida State at the Citrus Bowl Classic in Orlando and then his record 51 against Auburn.
""I don't mind passing the record from Charlotte to Charlotte,"" Tony joked.
One by one, the Tennessee players lined up to hug or shake hands with Tony and his wife, Barbie. Speaking to the players following a morning shootaround prior to a Jan. 19 clash against Alabama, Tony had bits of advice for just about every player.
Tony, admittedly running on fumes at times with the chemo being pumped into his body, received a warm reception from the crowd when he was introduced on the court during a first-half timeout and was in the victorious locker room afterward, a game the then-No. 3 Vols had to grind out for a 71-68 victory and their 12th straight triumph, a winning streak that now sits at a school-record 19 in a row entering Saturday night's showdown with No. 5-ranked Kentucky.
""I'm going through a battle right now, leukemia, and just to see the joy that you guys play the game with and what you're doing lifts me up and gives me that fight and energy when I see y'all out there battling, and that's what it's all about,"" White told the team that morning.
""It's inspiring, especially to hear him say we inspire him and to keep fighting,"" Tennessee senior Admiral Schofield said. ""It really touched me and makes you step back and realize that it's bigger than basketball. Life is hard and life can hit you in many different ways, and any way you can impact lives, through basketball, off the court or through your platform, you've got to be able to connect with people.
""For someone like him, a legend here, to say we inspire him -- and he's fighting something that's real. We're not talking about a basketball game -- that puts it all into perspective. It's just amazing to see the way he's taking something that's a lot bigger than we're facing head-on.""
Tony has three sons: Marquise, Tony Jr. and Ronrico. Ronrico is a graduate assistant on Gardner-Webb's basketball staff and loves to joke with his dad that there must have been 100,000-plus in the building the night he dropped 51 on Auburn if everybody who tells Ronrico they were there were genuinely there.
""Stokely only held about 12,000 people, but I felt every one of them that night ... and still do,"" Tony said.
There are many within the Tennessee community who have also made generous donations to an account set up to help the White family with Tony's medical costs. The people donating money to Tony's cause include everybody from Mike Strange, a former sportswriter for the Knoxville News Sentinel who covered Tony at Tennessee; to former Tennessee assistant coach Jack Fertig, who recruited Tony; to former Tennessee sports information director David Grim; to former UT manager Bo Braswell; to random fans from Greece who watched Tony play professionally. Tony even received a phone call from former Indiana star guard and former UCLA coach Steve Alford. The two matched up against each other in the 1985 NIT Final Four.
""As we sat there and combed through all the different people who donated money, there were a lot of tears,"" Barbie said. ""You just feel the love.""
While it has been heartwarming to see the way the Tennessee basketball family has rallied around Tony, his most divine angel has been Barbie. She spends every night with him in the hospital, sleeps on the pullout lounger in the hospital room, gets up and goes to work and then returns that evening.
""She is my heart,"" Tony said.
Barbie echoes what Tony has told people repeatedly ever since he was diagnosed with cancer. They have leaned on their Christian faith, especially during some of the darker times and late-night trips to the hospital.
""God never promised us sunshine without rain,"" she said. ""He just promised to be there if we call on him.""
The encouraging news is Tony's cancer is in remission, but doctors have told him the type of cancer he has will evolve and come back even stronger if he remains solely on maintenance chemotherapy. The next step is a bone marrow transplant, which is scheduled for the second week of March at the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center in Nashville. Tony's brother, Gene, will be the donor after tests recently determined that Gene's marrow was a perfect 10-for-10 match. The entire procedure and recovery will keep Tony in Nashville for 100 days, and doctors have told him he has a 70 percent chance of living a normal life if the transplant is successful.
Through it all, Tony has usually been the one to cheer up everybody around him, even on some of his most difficult days, when a lymph node on his neck might swell up to scary proportions or when he's especially frail after going days without eating because he couldn't keep anything down.
For me, it is Tony's heart, his determination and faith that have been the best motivation for all of us who love him so dearly.
Emblazoned on the wall in Tennessee's new sprawling, state-of-the-art locker room is a passage from Proverbs 18:24 ""... but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.""
Tony looks at the passage and nods assuredly as he eases into one of the comfy couches in the Vols' locker room following the Alabama game. As a guest of the Vol Network, he watched the game from a luxury suite high atop Thompson-Boling Arena, much of the time while wearing a mask over his mouth, per his doctor's orders.
It was a long and tiring day, but one Tony wouldn't have missed for the world. He said it was the first time he'd really felt ""normal"" since learning that he had cancer in September.
""I've had a chance to travel the world and to play basketball all over the world. I've truly been blessed, but this is a day I'll always remember,"" said Tony, his voice oozing with conviction.
That makes two of us, Wiz. And there are going to be a lot more of those days, too.

25963527,"Heeke, speaking to reporters at halftime of the Wildcats' 69-55 loss to visiting Washington State, wouldn't talk about the Phelps case or any other issues related to a possible NCAA investigation.
""We're fully supportive of the coaching staff, the leadership of the basketball program,"" Heeke said. ""We're supporting, as I have said before, we support Coach Miller. Those things that have been said to the contrary to that are not true.""
Robert Franks matched his career high for the second straight game with 34 points and Washington State ended a 13-game losing streak against Arizona by beating the Wildcats 69-55 on Saturday night.
After a meeting Thursday morning in Phoenix, the Arizona Board of Regents publicly supported the University of Arizona's decision to fire basketball assistant coach Mark Phelps.
Arizona on Wednesday initiated the process to terminate Phelps, and on Thursday, board of regents chair Ron Shoopman said in a statement that the school removed Phelps ""following due process provided in policy.""
""The board is confident this decision was made to ensure the utmost integrity and highest standards in the UA men's basketball program,"" Shoopman said. ""As the governing body of Arizona's public universities, the board is committed to doing everything possible to uphold the excellence and quality of the institutions we oversee, including the athletic programs at the universities.""
Phelps' attorney, Donald Maurice Jackson, of Montgomery, Alabama, said Phelps was removed because of an alleged NCAA rules violation.
The school said Wednesday in a statement that Phelps' removal was ""not related to the federal criminal proceedings in New York or the NCAA's review of the facts underlying the allegations of unlawful conduct.""
Sources told ESPN that Phelps is accused of a violation regarding former Arizona recruit Shareef O'Neal's academic transcripts. O'Neal, the son of former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal, committed to the Wildcats in 2017 before signing with UCLA. O'Neal sat out this season because of a heart condition.
Phelps, in his fourth season on Arizona's staff, denies wrongdoing and has cooperated with university and NCAA investigators, Jackson told ESPN.
Information from ESPN's Mark Schlabach and Josh Weinfuss and The Associated Press was used in this report.

25923215,"It's another edition of What's Real/What's Fake in college basketball, and if it's your first time with us here, this is where we separate the real from the hype in the college hoops landscape. So, let's get to it ...
At this point in most seasons, with the Super Bowl in the books, a multitude of casual fans prepping for their office pools will usually wander over to college basketball. If you're in that category, you should know you've missed an abundance of developments in the first three months of the season.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
Indiana's win at Michigan State can be a launching pad to the tourney, and other college hoops hot takes I can prove.
But we'll do our best to help you get caught up:
1. The Big 12 title streak might end for Kansas .... or not. Kansas has endured every possible problem. Udoka Azubuike is out for the season and now Silvio De Sousa has been ruled ineligible, a byproduct of the FBI's bribery investigation. And the Jayhawks, who have lost three of their past five games, have been a middle-of-the-pack offensive and defensive team in Big 12 play. Plus, they lost Marcus Garrett (7.2 PPG) to an ankle injury before Saturday's game against Texas Tech.
With a collection of teams -- Baylor, Iowa State, Kansas State and Texas Tech -- in the mix at the top of the league, Kansas hasn't looked this vulnerable in years. But Saturday's 16-point win over Texas Tech at Allen Fieldhouse highlighted KU's potential, especially when Dedric Lawson (25 points, 10 rebounds, 2 blocks) is dominant. The Jayhawks still have road games against Kansas State and Texas Tech ahead. But don't put your money on another team winning the Big 12 title and stopping KU from extending its run to 15 consecutive titles just yet. With four home games remaining on its conference schedule and Lawson playing like an All-American, it's still too early to make any assumptions in the Big 12 race.
2. If you thought Pac-12 football was bad, check out basketball in that league. The conference sent three teams to the NCAA tournament last year, and with a month to go in the regular season, it does not have any guaranteed invites beyond its automatic berth.
3. Gonzaga's Brandon Clarke (16.4 PPG, 3.0 BPG) is an athletic marvel.
4. Tennessee will be the king of the SEC again ... unless a Kentucky squad that hasn't lost since Jan. 5 and has risen into the top 10 in adjusted defensive efficiency after a stint in the 60s earlier this season catches the Vols.
5. The only way we're going to see Ja Morant (24.1 PPG, 10.3 APG) and his viral dunks, passes and layups in the NCAA tournament will be if Murray State wins the Ohio Valley Conference tournament, so you should root for that outcome. Trust us.
6. Zion Williamson. Google him.
7. Memphis Tigers coach Penny Hardaway said other coaches have some ""jealousy"" of him and his staff, which includes former NBA players Mike Miller and Sam Mitchell, before losing to Tulsa by 16 points and entering halftime of a road loss at South Florida on Saturday down 38-13. Hardaway has signed a top-10 recruiting class that's anchored by James Wiseman, the No. 1 recruit in the country. Hardaway is already taking steps toward reviving this program. But the timing of these comments wasn't good.
8. The Big Ten might not have a great team, but it has a bunch of good ones. And that's why the conference could send up to 10 teams -- no joke -- to the NCAA tournament.
9. After a hot and cold November and December, North Carolina, which has won its past five games by an average of 13.8 PPG, is shaping up to be a handful for any opponent in the postseason. And freshman Coby White (14.8 PPG, 4.2 APG) has matured into a young leader for a Tar Heels squad that has two matchups against Duke and a home game against Virginia remaining on their schedule.
10. Villanova lost three first-round picks and the Wooden Award winner after winning the national title last year, but the Wildcats are 9-0 atop the Big East with Phil Booth (18.7 PPG) and Eric Paschall (17.0 PPG) leading the way.
If you believe what's above, you clearly didn't watch Virginia Tech at NC State. The Wolfpack scored 24 points during a 23-point home loss to the Hokies. Per ESPN Stats & Information, 92 players scored at least 24 points on Saturday. NC State had 14 points at halftime. The over/under for the game was 152. They only missed it by 81 points.
Houston's head coach has won 21 or more games in four consecutive seasons. His current Houston squad is his second consecutive top-20 defensive team, too.
He's underrated even within the American Athletic Conference, where Gregg Marshall and Mick Cronin have been deservedly praised for their achievements in recent years. But Sampson's team has one loss this season and it's in a tie with Cincinnati for first place in the conference.
Corey Davis Jr. and Armoni Brooks are two of the most talented players in the country.
Sampson belongs in the national coach of the year convos.
The immediate reaction to the initial unveiling of the NET rankings was an emotional one. The NCAA had dropped this new barometer on us without really explaining the nuances of its formula. But the current rankings don't stray too far from what most believe about the hierarchy of college basketball. Still, until we fully understand how the NCAA came up with this formula and how it will be used on Selection Sunday, we cannot say that all is well with the NET.
Let's see what happens in February, when more teams might be searching for blowout wins because the NET caps credit for margin of victory at 10 points but heavily rewards teams according to efficiency margin. That part doesn't make sense, but coaches are clearly aware of the latter's impact on their NET standing. It'll be interesting to see what the NET looks like in March.
But don't give the NCAA too much credit yet.
Entering this week, a KenPom-record 136 teams have taken at least 40 percent of their shots this season from beyond the 3-point line. Two years ago, 84 teams had hit that 40 percent mark. Ten years ago, 38 teams hit that mark.
These numbers matter because the positionless basketball wave has impacted college basketball at a rapid rate. And more teams than ever have diversified their strategies to include more shots from beyond the arc.

Raw stats (+10): Averaged 22.5 PPG, 11.5 RPG, 4.5 SPG in wins over St. John's and Boston College.
Advanced stats (+10): His five blocks and nine steals this week back Synergy Sports' ""excellent"" rating for his isolation defense.
Best assist (+10): To whoever is feeding him at Duke. What is he eating? He looked like a protein powder commercial against normal players on Boston College's roster.
The casual, two-step, broad-jump dunk bonus (+11): When he got the steal on Shamorie Ponds in the first half of the St. John's game, took a few steps and just sailed to the rim, it looked like a trailer for another Marvel film. That why's all of these kids will be wearing the Air Zions next year.
Unintentionally endangering an opponent's future deduction (3): Check the tape. Early in the Boston College win, Ky Bowman (6-foot-1, 188 pounds) tried to put a body on Williamson on the block. It was a commendable, albeit, dangerous effort. Bowman caught a shoulder to the chest and moved back about four feet before Williamson grabbed a rebound and scored on a putback. Bowman had that ""What are the chances I'm bleeding on the inside?"" look after that play. Go play with the big kids, Zion!
Missed dunk deduction (-6): I'm just mad he missed it. Had Williamson pulled off that fast-break reverse on Boston College, the ACC would have been forced to temporarily boot the Eagles out of the league. But we were robbed on that fast break. A guy in the front row hugged his friend after realizing he was so close to an ""I was there"" moment.
2. Tre Jones (33 points)

25924062,"Waters' plan -- to graduate from Norman North (Okla.) High School, take a prep year at the prestigious Brewster Academy in New Hampshire to get bigger and stronger, and then start his career as a Division I basketball player -- had gone off course. It was all happening so fast now, like he'd taken a wrong turn and was sent careering down a steep cliff. He tried to treat his time at Sunrise as if it were just another weekend basketball tournament, but he knew better. He knew he wasn't returning to his family and friends on Monday, and he knew exactly why.
Auburn grabs a No. 4 seed after a resounding victory over Tennessee in the SEC title game.
Here's your updated source for all of the latest on the NCAA tournament bubble.
Which of the top 16 teams can make a Champ Week, bracket-improving move?
He could tell himself it wasn't fair, that it was all a big misunderstanding and an even bigger overreaction. He could say it was a careless prank that was supposed to stay among friends and instead broke into the open. He could blame it on a lack of due process. When his mother, Lisa, got the call saying he was no longer welcome at Norman North, there wasn't much of a conversation. ""OK. ... All right. ... Thanks,"" is all Waters overheard her say before hanging up. Rather than receiving a three-day suspension as they'd imagined, she informed her son he was suspended the fall and spring semesters of his senior year. In effect, he'd been expelled.
All of this because of a bet over a game of ""NBA 2K""? Waters played with the Bulls, his friend the Trail Blazers. He lost by five, and as a result, he had to take a photo holding an Airsoft gun and share it on Snapchat. His face out of the frame, he sent it to four friends and didn't give it another thought. It was Monday and he was excited to visit Brewster the following day. They had the rest of the week off for fall break.
When he landed in Detroit the next day to catch a connecting flight, his phone regained a signal and a tidal wave of notifications lit up his screen. Where are you? Everyone is looking for you! Panicked, he asked why, wracking his brain for what he might have done. The response was a gut punch: There's a picture of you with a gun.
He couldn't believe it and slowly put together the puzzle: Someone took a screen-grab of his Snapchat and shared it; traced the AAU jersey he was wearing back to him; and although the black plastic Airsoft gun had an orange tip, it was mistaken for being the real thing. And it all was tied to a message written on a bathroom stall that Monday warning of a school shooting. It was crazy how the cops and helicopters descended on campus. The entire school went on lockdown.
From the airport, Waters called the principal to explain. He hadn't made any threats. It was all a big mistake, he said. He thought the conversation went well and it would blow over. But it kept picking up steam.
""It was a little overwhelming,"" Waters recalled. College coaches such as Tony Bennett and Travis Ford, who were recruiting him, called his father to try to get to the bottom of what happened. How could this kid with offers from Harvard and Yale get expelled? This son of school administrators? And what was the deal with the gun?
When Waters' mother told him he'd need to find a new school, he went into shock. He couldn't lift himself off the couch for hours. Brewster wasn't planning on him coming for another year and didn't have a scholarship available. Other schools wouldn't allow him to enroll in light of the incident. It took a one-on-one conversation with Sunrise's president to get the all-clear to go there, and even then Waters wasn't thrilled with the possibility.
""This is what my life is now,"" he told himself. ""I need to move on.""
At Sunrise, he would be shut off from the world. Books and ball; that was it. They weren't allowed to use their phones during the day, and they couldn't leave. But the siloed nature of the academy focused him. He gained confidence going against better competition on the basketball court. He matured off it.
""It made me grow up extremely fast,"" he said. ""If it had been a real gun, if I had been on campus -- I was 18 and could have been charged with something. I came to the realization that I need to be careful -- who I'm around, what I'm doing, think about how it's going to impact my future.""
A few months later, Norman North rescinded his suspension and he returned home. After sitting out several games, he was allowed back on the basketball team and helped it make a run all the way to the state title game. He no longer needed a prep year, he thought. Inadvertently, he'd already gone through that experience. He was ready to go to Oklahoma State.
He had no idea the surprises in his life weren't over, his journey from cautionary tale to role model of the Native American community only beginning.
It's not that Waters didn't embrace his Native American heritage. That was never the case. According to his father, it was ""critical"" he did. So he was raised in it and grew up knowing where he came from. That he was of Kiowa and Cherokee descent. That his great-great-great-grandmother was an Irish captive in the 1800s, and how his great-grandparents had their native languages beaten out of them in grade school.
As a kid, he'd visit tribal lands, attend powwows and stomp dances. Back home, his father, who worked for more than a decade in Native American outreach at the University of Oklahoma, would take him to cultural events at the Lloyd Noble Center on campus.
But while Waters enjoyed the music and dancing that took place -- he often found himself humming along -- he shied away from actually participating himself. He was just like his father, Lindy Jr., when he was younger. If you wanted to find the former NAIA All-American power forward on the reservation, the first place to look was the gym.
It was there -- not back home at Norman North with teammates such as Trae Young, but on the road playing with his fellow Native Americans -- where Waters' hobby and heritage began to intersect. It would teach him a type of basketball he didn't know existed -- ""rez ball"" -- and help elevate him to a platform he didn't realize was possible.
Waters was in the seventh grade when he was invited to his first Native American basketball tournament. His father saw how nervous his son was during that long drive to Henryetta, Oklahoma. He'd never been around so many Native Americans, and when they got there the other kids mockingly called him ""white boy."" (Waters' father is a full-blooded Native American, and his mother is of both Cherokee and white heritage.) They were the same taunts he got when he played in the city, and every time he wanted to correct them.
He'd just hit a growth spurt to reach 6-foot-4 by then, but was still only 140 pounds. To him, everyone on the court looked like a grown man. And right away, things got chippy. The first shot he attempted, someone took his legs out from under him. The next time down, a defender hit his elbow. Neither drew a foul.
It was then, after a teammate was practically tackled attempting a layup, that the competitor in him took over.
""I'm like, 'All right, you want to play like that? I'm just here to play basketball, but if you want to get physical, we can,'"" Waters recalled. ""And then I start using my sweep move.""
As an accurate midrange shooter, it wasn't uncommon for defenders to crowd him. So he used an old trick his father taught him to create space. Holding the ball with both hands, he would lean forward and move it in a circular, sweeping motion up above his head and back down to his chest. That way if the defender was cheating in too close, they'd catch a face full of elbows. It was legal as long as he kept his elbows tucked in.
The first sweep move in the tournament made contact and nearly broke his defender's nose. A scuffle had to be broken up. It got more physical after that, and the game eventually ended in a brawl.
""Technically, the rules are the same,"" Waters said of rez ball. ""Technically.""
""I still point to that time in his basketball career when his basketball IQ went through the roof,"" Lindy Jr. said. ""Everything changed with him. He got more aggressive.""
A few years later, at an AAU tournament in high school, that newfound edge helped him when he went head-to-head with Dennis Smith Jr. and held the future NBA first-round pick to roughly 10 points. Waters, meanwhile, scored more than 20. Soon after, the Ivy League and mid-major schools offered him scholarships. Power 5 programs such as Oklahoma State followed.
Waters wasn't a mega-watt recruit, per se. ESPN ranked him as a respectable three-star prospect and the third-best player in the state, just ahead of an undiscovered Trae Young. His hometown university, Oklahoma, slow-played his recruitment enough to prop the door open for in-state rival Oklahoma State to eventually gain his commitment. But when the largely anonymous guard arrived on the Stillwater campus in 2016, it was as if the entire Native American community stood up and took notice of him.
Ever since his freshman season, the website NDNSports.com, which covers Native American athletics exclusively, has attended Waters' games, written feature stories on him and filed regular updates on his progress. The response, according to one of the site's founders, Brent Cahwee, has been overwhelming.
As one of only seven Native American Division I basketball players last season, Waters has become a role model in the community. And, more importantly, he has embraced the opportunity because he knows there haven't been many athletes historically for Native Americans to look up to. He'd grown up with antique photos of Jim Thorpe to hang on his wall. When the Oklahoma City Thunder wanted to honor Native American basketball players before a game in 2010, his father was one of only three people asked to appear -- one from the '50s, one for the '70s and one from the '80s. You couldn't help but think: Was there really no one from then until now?
So when Native Americans reach out to Waters, he takes care to respond. When they want an autograph, he signs whenever it's possible. Last May, he and his father hosted basketball clinics for Native American kids, teaching them the game and answering questions.
""It was wild,"" Waters said. ""My first day we had two camps -- one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The first one there were 30-40 kids, and then the next one we were in a high school gym with 150 kids. We didn't have enough basketballs. It was just eye-opening.""
Cahwee heard about those camps through the grapevine and points to acts like that as being the real difference-maker. Waters is a solid Big 12 player -- not quite a star -- but the reason he draws such a strong response from the Native American community is, as Cahwee put it, ""He embraces his heritage.""
In August, the American Indian Exposition took the extraordinary step of naming him -- a 21-year-old college basketball player -- ""Indian of the Year."" At the parade an hour west of Norman, he was blown away by the response. He looked out and saw a sea of Oklahoma apparel. ""Just crimson everywhere,"" he said, ""and a little bit of orange."" And yet they were all there for him, blurring party lines.
""It didn't matter who we cheered for, we were all Native Americans coming together,"" he said.
When asked why they gravitate toward him, he said he thought basketball played only a small role.
""I think for the most part they acknowledge me because I acknowledge them back. I talk about it. I express it. I tell everyone how important it is to me. I go to clinics. I help Native American kids, teach them basketball, answer any questions. I'm a part of them.""
His is an eminently relatable story. He made a stupid mistake when he was young and has learned from it. He encountered obstacles along the way and persevered.
Lindy Jr. remembers his son showing up at home unexpectedly during the summer of his freshman year. He was crying and wouldn't say why. Then, after a few hours, he composed himself and told his parents how his teammate, Tyrek Coger, had died earlier that day.
Not just that, Waters was there when it happened. When Coger collapsed in the middle of a workout, Waters was the one asked to pump the CPR mask delivering oxygen while emergency personnel tried in vain to resuscitate the 21-year-old Coger, who had recently transferred to OSU.
If the incident with the Airsoft gun didn't make him grow up, seeing Coger die before his eyes from what was later deemed to be an enlarged heart did. Although Waters doesn't talk about it much -- same for his tumultuous senior year of high school, which many of his teammates don't even know about -- both instances made an impact on him, Lindy Jr. said.
There was a scripture passage the family had come to identify with that would later find itself written inside Waters' sneakers. The passage is Philippians 3:13, which is about moving on for a higher purpose. But the specific phrase that has become a mantra for both father and son is, ""I press on.""
As it turns out, his time in Stillwater would demand the patience and perspective he picked up along the way.
During his freshman season, Waters suffered a concussion and a fractured foot that caused him to miss significant time. And even then -- even after he helped the team reach the NCAA tournament -- came more bad news when coach Brad Underwood left unexpectedly for Illinois after being hired at OSU only a year earlier. A few months later, when Waters was sitting in class, another flood of notifications hit his phone. The team's group message wouldn't stop pinging. ""What's happening?"" read one text. Another said, ""I don't know yet. Let's have a team meeting.""
At first, Waters thought it was just a couple of his teammates having a one-on-one conversation in the group chat that he could ignore. Then he got a call from his parents. Then his coaches.
""They're like, 'Coach Lamont is in trouble,'"" Waters recalled. ""The FBI was at his door.""
Lamont Evans, an assistant coach, was arrested that September as part of a sweeping federal investigation into corruption within college basketball. He was charged with accepting bribes, later pleading guilty.
The team limped to a 21-15 record that season, but the next season was supposed to be better. Waters was one of a handful of veterans stepping into leadership roles, and there were a few underclassmen who looked to have potential. One of them, sophomore guard Michael Weathers, started off hot, averaging 9.2 points per game.
But then, in mid-January with the team hovering around .500, Weathers and two others were dismissed from the program after allegedly committing acts of vandalism. OSU was left with only nine players on the roster, including a walk-on.
So, yes, there have been plenty of opportunities for Waters to throw in the towel -- to give up or straight up leave. But he shrugs it off.
""My senior year of high school I had to do a big change really quick,"" he explained. ""And then I was there for a little bit, came back to North for a couple of months, go to OSU, change, Coach Underwood one year, change. Everything was changing so fast that I got used to it. New coach, new year, everything is fine.""
He has had to adjust, of course. When it felt as if half the team had been suspended, he vowed to do what he had to in order to get through it. Coaches asked him to shoot more, to be more aggressive. Now he's playing everything but the center position, and much of the offense is flowing through him.
Coach Mike Boynton says Waters is the most versatile player on the team now, which is a good thing when you barely have enough players to field a team in the first place. Boynton called him a ""stabilizing force.""
""Hats off to him to have the courage to say that things don't look perfect and that's OK, this is going to be a learning experience that I'm going to be better for in the future,"" Boynton said. ""I've got a great admiration for his ability to take things in, to shoulder some responsibility for his opportunity here in making it the best possible, regardless of the circumstances surrounding him.
""I've never felt any hesitation from him that this is where he wants to be.""
Boynton, who was an assistant with Underwood, has seen Waters' progress up close over the past three seasons. As a freshman, he shot 71.4 percent from the foul line and averaged 5.7 points per game. This season, as a junior, he's up to 94.6 percent, missing just three of his 56 attempts. Through 21 games, he's averaging 12.4 points, 4.8 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game.
At 6-foot-6 with a point guard handle, he's a mismatch. He's a solid defender and knows how to play physical basketball. ""He's got an edge,"" Boynton said. In other words: There's a lot there to like. The only missing piece seems to be belief.
Talking to Boynton and Lindy Jr., there's the sense that Waters is still coming into his own, still learning, still maturing on and off the court. Being so calm and introspective has helped him weather so many storms, but now he needs to turn the corner.
""He needs to start thinking of himself as an elite player,"" Boynton said. ""Because he has that ability. I don't know that he thinks of himself in that regard because he's so unselfish, because he wants everyone to share in that success. But sometimes you need a guy to step up and feel like, 'Yeah, I'm the man here.'""
Maybe he'll get there. Then again, maybe he won't. His story is already compelling enough as it stands.
With his senior season rapidly approaching, Waters said he wants to go as far as basketball will take him. He's not ready to give up playing competitively anytime soon.
But there is a plan whenever that part of his life comes to an end. He got the bug hosting those basketball clinics last summer and wants to see where that goes. His goal: start a nonprofit organization and help Native American kids.
He knows better than most what it's like at that age -- the possibilities and the pitfalls. He can show them how to play basketball, but he can teach them so much more.

25938262,"Louisville officials ruled Bowen, a five-star recruit from Saginaw, Michigan, ineligible after an FBI investigation uncovered that an Adidas employee and others conspired to pay his father $100,000 for him to sign with the Cardinals.
After Bowen transferred to South Carolina, the NCAA ruled him ineligible for the 2018-19 season. Bowen, 20, never played a game in college and is playing professionally in Australia.
Here's how watching VCU at George Washington on Wednesday on ESPN+ will help you build your bracket.
The late-season top 20 for both the men's and women's Wooden Award was announced on Monday night, with Duke's Zion Williamson and Oregon's Sabrina Ionescu leading the way.
In November 2018, Bowen sued Adidas, Adidas employees Chris Rivers and James Gatto, former Adidas consultants Merl Code and Thomas ""T.J."" Gassnola, former NBA runner Christian Dawkins and financial manager Munish Sood, alleging they violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act by engaging in bribery, fraud and money laundering at the expense of his eligibility and athletic development.
""Bowen purports to decry the state of amateur basketball in this country, but through the actions of his father over many years, Bowen was an active participant in and beneficiary of endemic recruiting violations,"" Adidas lawyers wrote in a motion filed in U.S. District Court in South Carolina on Wednesday.
""The Complaint is a cynical attempt to recover indirect damages from his father's alleged co-conspirators for speculative injuries that he has not suffered and which he may never incur. Even crediting Bowen's declarations of innocence -- which the court must at this stage -- a careful analysis of the Complaint's allegations show that it fails to state a claim under RICO and must be dismissed.""
Brian Bowen Sr., a former police officer, testified in federal court in October that he received thousands of dollars from Gassnola, Dawkins and Rivers for his son to play for Adidas-affiliated grassroots programs. Sood also testified that Bowen Sr. received $19,400 in cash as the first of four payments for Bowen II to attend Louisville.
Bowen Sr. also testified that a handful of colleges, including Arizona, Creighton, Oklahoma State and Texas, offered him tens of thousands of dollars in cash and other improper benefits for his son to play basketball at those schools.
Bowen II has maintained that he was unaware of his father's schemes.
Gatto, Code and Dawkins were convicted of felony charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in October's trial; Sood and Gassnola testified after reaching plea deals with federal prosecutors.
Rivers hasn't been charged in any of the cases.
""The injuries Bowen alleges, such as losing the experience of playing collegiate basketball or reduced future earnings on a hypothetical contract to play in the National Basketball Association, are almost entirely speculative expectation damages or intangible harms that cannot be collected under RICO,"" Adidas' lawyers wrote in the complaint.
""The lone exception is Bowen's purported lost scholarship at UofL. ... UofL's statement demonstrates that Bowen retained his scholarship even after being withheld from playing basketball and voluntarily relinquished it when he decided to leave UofL.""

""We feel terrible for Killian,"" head coach Mark Few said in a statement. ""He is an incredible teammate and an absolute joy to coach. Killian is a tough kid. We are hopeful treatment will go well and get him back for the postseason.""
Tillie, a 6-foot-10 junior from France, missed the first 15 games of the season with an ankle injury and was still working his way back into the lineup. He was averaging 6.0 points and 4.2 rebounds in nine games this season but was one of the best players in the West Coast Conference last season.
When he was fully healthy a year ago, Tillie put up 12.9 points and 5.9 rebounds, while shooting 47.9 percent from 3-point range and establishing himself as one of the more versatile defensive players in the country.
With Tillie out, Gonzaga's frontcourt depth behind Rui Hachimura and Brandon Clarke will fall to senior Jeremy Jones and freshman Filip Petrusev, whose role has diminished considerably since Tillie returned to the fold.

25941649,"Phelps' attorney, Donald Maurice Jackson, of Montgomery, Alabama, said Phelps was suspended because of an alleged NCAA rules violation.
""The University of Arizona is committed to the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct and our commitment to those principles is unwavering,"" Dave Heeke, Arizona's director of athletics, said in a statement. ""The decision to remove Coach Phelps immediately is a direct result of that commitment. We strive to compete within the rules of the NCAA and the Pac-12 Conference, and we will continue to cooperate fully with the NCAA. Coach [Sean] Miller fully supports this decision, which we agree is in the best interests of our men's basketball program and the University.""
The university said in a statement that Phelps' suspension is ""not related to the federal criminal proceedings in New York or the NCAA's review of the facts underlying the allegations of unlawful conduct.""
Sources told ESPN that Phelps is accused of a violation regarding former Arizona recruit Shareef O'Neal's academic transcripts. O'Neal, the son of former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal, was committed to the Wildcats in 2017 before signing with UCLA.
O'Neal sat out this season because of a heart condition.
Phelps, in his fourth season on Arizona's staff, denies wrongdoing and has cooperated with university and NCAA investigators, Jackson told ESPN.
""Mark Phelps has done absolutely nothing in violation of NCAA rules,"" Jackson said. ""He has been fully cooperative with the NCAA. He has been in daily contact with the compliance staff. This is a direct response to a published story [about alleged NCAA rules violations at Arizona], and they're trying to entrap a coach in something he had no involvement in.""
The Arizona Board of Regents is scheduled to meet in Phoenix on Thursday to discuss, among other agenda items, ""legal advice and discussion regarding University of Arizona's Men's Basketball.""
""This is just a circular attempt to go after Sean Miller,"" a source told ESPN.
Last month, former Arizona assistant Emanuel ""Book"" Richardson pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to commit bribery.
Richardson, who was accused of accepting $20,000 in bribes to steer Arizona players to certain managers and financial advisers once they turned pro, might face 18 to 24 months in prison. He is scheduled for sentencing in U.S. District Court in New York on April 24.
An Outside the Lines analysis of former NBA runner Christian Dawkins' cellphone records from May 3, 2017, to July 2, 2017, shows there were at least 13 phone calls involving a cell number belonging to Miller. The records show that each of the calls Dawkins made to or received from the number associated with Miller lasted at least five minutes.
Dawkins was one of three men convicted in October on federal felony charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud related to pay-for-play schemes to send high-profile recruits to Adidas-sponsored schools.
During that trial, Brian Bowen Sr., the father of former Louisville signee Brian Bowen II, testified that Dawkins told him that Arizona assistant coach Joe Pasternack offered $50,000 for Bowen to sign with the Wildcats. Pasternack is now the head coach at UC Santa Barbara.
Defense attorneys during the October trial also suggested that Arizona offered -- or was prepared to offer -- $150,000 for current North Carolina player Nassir Little to sign with the Wildcats. The government and defense attorneys agreed that the money wasn't requested on behalf of Little's family.
ESPN reported in February 2018 that Dawkins and Miller had discussions about a $100,000 payment that ensured that star center Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 pick in June's NBA draft, signed with the Wildcats from the Class of 2017.
Phelps was suspended for five days without pay in November 2017, and Wildcats player Keanu Pinder was suspended for the opener for an undisclosed rules violation.
In a social media post on Wednesday, Jackson included a statement that he said was from the NCAA's director of enforcement, which read: ""At this point, the enforcement staff has made no determinations regarding potential violations involving Coach Phelps as we are still in the process of collecting information and conducting interviews.""

25902687,"De Sousa, a 6-foot-9 sophomore from Angola and a key reserve in Kansas' run to the Final Four last season, has been held out of competition by the Jayhawks since October, when former Adidas consultant T.J. Gassnola testified in federal court that he paid $2,500 to De Sousa's guardian, Fenny Falmagne.
""In my 30-plus years of coaching college basketball, I have never witnessed such a mean-spirited and vindictive punishment against a young man who did nothing wrong,"" Self said in a statement released shortly after the NCAA announced its ruling. ""To take away his opportunity to play college basketball is shameful and a failure of the NCAA.
""Silvio is a tremendous young man who absolutely deserves to be on the court with his teammates in a Jayhawk uniform. This process took way too long to address these issues. We will support Silvio as he considers his options.""
Former South Carolina and Oklahoma State assistant Lamont Evans has pleaded guilty, admitting to accepting $22,000 in bribes to steer players toward certain financial advisers and managers once they turned pro.
Former Adidas exec James Gatto, Merl Code and Christian Dawkins were found guilty in a pay-for-play scheme involving high-profile basketball recruits of Kansas, Louisville and NC State.
Text messages presented by defense attorneys on Monday indicated the Kansas coaches were at least aware of former Adidas consultant T.J. Gassnola's involvement in the Jayhawks' recruitment of current player Silvio De Sousa, a native of Angola.
In its statement, the NCAA said a student-athlete is responsible for the actions of any third party involved in the recruitment process, regardless of whether the athlete knew of any improprieties or not.
""Membership guidelines state the starting point for these violations is permanent ineligibility, but the NCAA staff recognized mitigation based on the specific circumstances of this case when making its decision,"" the NCAA said in its ruling on De Sousa's eligibility.
The NCAA said De Sousa, who has not played in any games this season, can appeal the decision to the Division I Student-Athlete Reinstatement Committee, which Kansas athletic director Jeff Long said would happen ""immediately.""
""This was clearly an unfair and punitive ruling for a young man who had no knowledge of any NCAA violation, nor did Silvio personally benefit from the violation,"" Long said in a statement. ""While we will continue to work with the NCAA on the broader matter, we have an obligation and a desire to advocate for our student-athletes, and will continue to do that for an outstanding young man.""
De Sousa's attorney, Scott Tompsett, called the decision ""outrageous.""
""It should shock the conscience of anyone who believes in fundamental fairness,"" Tompsett said. ""Silvio did absolutely nothing wrong. He was not involved in any wrongdoing by the adults, he did not know about any wrongdoing by the adults, and he did not benefit from any wrongdoing by the adults.
""... Let me be very clear: Silvio never received any illicit money from anyone. The NCAA's decision illustrates the absurdity of how the NCAA enforces its rules: A young man who did nothing wrong has had his life altered in a very negative way through no fault of his own.
