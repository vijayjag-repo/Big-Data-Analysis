26114712,"Talbot, who was acquired from Edmonton in mid-February for fellow goaltender Anthony Stolarz, became No. 8 on Friday night when he made 30 saves in a 6-3 win over the New Jersey Devils.
""He was solid, it's been a few days since his last game but he looked good in there for us and gave us a chance to win so that's all you could ask for from your goalie,"" said Flyers forward James van Riemsdyk, who scored twice.
Talbot was sharp from the start. He stopped Blake Coleman on a short-handed breakaway early in the five-minute power play for Philadelphia.
""That's a huge save,"" Talbot said. ""You never want to allow a short-handed goal, so for me that was a big confidence booster since I hadn't played for a while so that was a big one early that I needed and the team needed.""
Talbot gave up two second-period goals by giving up big rebounds.
""The first five minutes I had to get my legs under me but after that I just kind of settled in and made some big saves and that settled me in,"" he said. ""Then you just kind of try to control my game from there.""
Brian Elliott, Carter Hart, Michal Neuvirth, Calvin Pickard, Alex Lyon, Mike McKenna and Stolarz have also played goal for Philadelphia in a season during which the men between the pipes have missed 107 games because of injury.
Three other teams had shared the record with the Flyers: the 1989-90 Quebec Nordiques, 2002-03 St. Louis Blues and 2007-08 Los Angeles Kings.
Flyers interim head coach Scott Gordon was one of the Nordiques' seven goaltenders.

26241744,"The situation got so bad on one night in February that the AHL team in Tucson, plucked for call-ups, could dress only 17 players.
By the time Arizona visited Chicago on Monday (without top-six center Derek Stepan, out four to six weeks with an injured knee), the Coyotes had a total of 330 man games lost, the most in the league.
""No, I've never seen anything like this, nothing even close to this,"" Hinostroza says. ""Even with other teams. Every time you see someone go down holding their knee -- there's been so many knee injuries -- it's like, not again.
""It's insane,"" says defenseman Jordan Oesterle.
""It's actually crazy,"" says captain Oliver Ekman-Larsson.
""This is a first for me in my hockey career, and I hope this is the last too,"" says winger Christian Fischer. ""It's been wild -- I don't know how else to explain it.""
Greg Wyshynski and Emily Kaplan address the NHL's investigation regarding Morgan Rielly, and whether he used a homophobic slur during play in last night's game in Toronto (3:33). Canadian Olympian Shannon Szabados, of the Buffalo Beauts, explains her decision to play in the NWHL, ahead of the Isobel Cup Playoffs (16:06). Alison Lukan of The Athletic updates us on the state of the Columbus Blue Jackets since their busy trade deadline (36:08). Listen »
Says coach Rick Tocchet: ""I've been involved in the NHL for 30-something years now. I've seen some devastating injuries, some people come from the minors and play great for a team because of injuries. I've seen a lot of stuff. But I've never seen the magnitude of this.""
And GM John Chayka: ""I've never seen anything like it. Nothing in hockey, in sport, in life.""
Yet somehow, with 12 games remaining, the Coyotes are in the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference. Each of the dozen remaining games needs to be played with playoff intensity, and Fischer says the Coyotes are ""playing desperate."" On the line, somewhat inexplicably: the team's first postseason berth since 2012.
""We want the chance to make the playoffs and compete for the Stanley Cup,"" Chayka says. ""But I think our team is having fun. There's no pressure on us. We've gone through a lot of injuries. We've come a long way to get here, and now it's just about enjoying it and competing hard.""
So how are they doing it? Let's begin with the coach, who, if not for Barry Trotz's miracle work with the New York Islanders and Jon Cooper's juggernaut Tampa Bay Lightning, would be the runaway pick for Coach of the Year. Tocchet, 54, is the longtime NHL winger in his second year behind Arizona's bench after serving as an assistant in Pittsburgh. Tocchet also admits that two months ago ""it could have gone sideways on us.""
""But every time we came in, we worried about that day,"" Tocchet says. ""That really helped me as a coach: just worry about today. Because when you think big picture -- 'Oh, man, we don't have any centermen ... Oh, who's going to play center? Oh, this guy's out ... our starting goaltender is out' -- It overwhelms you as a coach. We just took it day by day. That really helped me, personally, to deal with it mentally.""
We look way ahead to the matchups we'd like to see in the conference finals this spring, with Sharks-Jets getting multiple votes.
Who has the best playoff chances? What teams are poised to land Jack Hughes with the No. 1 pick? Projections for both, plus the most important games today.
The Lightning are running away in the NHL's regular-season race. But they do have some weaknesses that can be exploited in the playoffs.
The team has a first-year captain in Ekman-Larsson. The Swedish defenseman got the ""C"" in September, two months after spurning what could have been a lucrative free-agent pay day to sign an eight-year extension in Arizona. Ekman-Larsson says he wanted to make sure he would still play his game, but he felt a bit overwhelmed by the added responsibilities off the ice: communicating with the coach on a day-to-day basis about schedule tweaks, practice habits, everything.
""A lot of stuff you have to think about off the ice,"" Ekman-Larsson says. ""Things like that you don't appreciate when you have Shane Doan here, and now that he's not here, you appreciate even more.""
Ekman-Larsson says he's lucky the retired Doan is still in Arizona, and still around the rink quite a bit to pick his brain.
""I think he was a little nervous when he got the captaincy,"" Tocchet says. ""Because he had to figure out how to be this big captain.""
Tocchet says the two had ""a couple of talks about it,"" and gave one piece of advice: ""Just be yourself."" Tocchet says he began to see a notice in his captain by November; Ekman-Larsson seemed more comfortable in the role.
Losing Raanta (the 29-year-old has played just 12 games this season) was a blow. The Coyotes acquired him in summer 2017 to be the No. 1 goaltender, but his tenure in Arizona has been plagued by a series of unfortunate events. After having to move out of his first house due to a scorpion infestation (really), Raanta played only 47 games in his first season as a No. 1, and he had to adjust his training and eating habits midseason -- and made it a point of emphasis this offseason -- to prove he could carry a full season's workload.
This season brought more setbacks, particularly on the injury front. Raanta has begun skating by himself, and Chayka says ""there's a chance"" he could be back if the Coyotes make the playoffs.
""The next step is getting him back to practice,"" Chayka says. ""Getting his timing back, getting the reps in.""
The team has since been buoyed by backup Darcy Kuemper. After a rough eight-game stretch in November (2-4-2, .898 save percentage) the 28-year-old asked for a meeting with Tocchet. Kuemper said then, ""If the team is going to win, I'm going to need to play better."" Since then, he has 18 wins in 32 games with a .920 save percentage.
As for the rest of the team? They've bought in to the ""next man up"" mentality in a big way. The Coyotes don't have any 20-goal scorers. Their leading scorer is Clayton Keller with 44 (and he's one of three players to suit up in every game this season).
""No one wants to be a superstar,"" Hinostroza says. ""Everyone knows that if we're going to outscore teams, we need to outwork teams with our defense. It's something, if you watch our team, we've really bought into the last few months.""
It seems fitting that the leading goal scorer is 34-year-old journeyman Brad Richardson, who is now at a career-high 16 goals in his 14th season. ""He's had a hell of a year,"" says Fischer. ""He's a guy that doesn't get too much credit. Where he plays in the lineup for most of his career, he's been that shutdown fourth-liner. But we all see him in practice and the way he plays over the past three, four years, and he has a really hard shot and works hard. It's cool to see him have success because he really doesn't get a lot of credit, doing the dirty job, shutting down other teams' top lines.""
It's been a bit of awkward optics for the Coyotes after they traded away a pair of first-round picks who are thriving with their new teams: Max Domi leads the Montreal Canadiens in scoring, and Dylan Strome is nearly a point-per-game player in his 45 games with the Chicago Blackhawks. Did the Coyotes give up too soon?
""The term 'give up'? That's not how I would term it,"" Chayka says. ""I think we were looking for specific needs for our team, and specific goals we had to grow this group. Obviously Alex Galchenyuk [acquired for Domi] is a dynamic goal scorer that has been a game-breaker for us; he's single-handedly won us some games down the stretch. [Nick] Schmaltz came in [as part of the Strome deal] and brought speed to the middle of the ice and playmaking, so we view it as a value play. Whether [Strome and Domi] do well or don't do well doesn't get back to our team when they're on the ice. I like Dylan and Max, and to see them do well is a good thing.""
Chayka is focused on the group he has now, the group that, despite adversity, is ahead of schedule. He says he was active working the phones before the trade deadline, despite not making any significant moves. Because after all, thanks to timing, the team was already getting an infusion of talent with Demers, Grabner, Dvorak and Richardson all returning from injury.
""We're long-term thinkers here,"" Chayka says. ""We're trying to improve this group, and if we felt there was something that helped us at this point -- with the bigger picture in mind of building a great team -- we were looking to do some things. We worked extremely hard and had a lot of conversation. We got close on a number of things, but, ultimately, nothing fit. We were OK on that on the basis of ... the status quo of our team is a really good team.""

26028364,"Thornton, 39, hadn't had a three-goal game since Oct. 27, 2010, when he had a five-point night in a 5-2 victory over the New Jersey Devils.
This time, he did the trick against the Bruins, the team that drafted him No. 1 overall in 1997, then traded him to San Jose in November 2005.
It looked like it was going to be the fitting capper of a great Sharks comeback from a 3-0 first-period deficit, as Thornton gave the Sharks a 5-4 lead with 6:28 left to play in the third period.
But a late goal by Boston's Chris Wagner and the overtime game winner by Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy dampened Thornton's celebration.
Thornton had reconstructive knee surgery each of the past two offseasons, which has limited his contributions and left him as the Sharks' third-line center.
The hat trick was the fifth of Thornton's career -- three as a Shark, two as a Bruin -- and made him the oldest player to have a three-goal game since Jaromir Jagr did so four seasons ago at 42.
Thornton, a likely future Hall of Famer, is 15th all time in points in the NHL.

""That was a special moment,"" Kucherov said.
""He's a remarkable player, and he's having an amazing season,"" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said.
Steven Stamkos and Kucherov scored in the shootout, giving Tampa Bay a 2-1 win and 100 points on the season. The Lightning, who ran their winning streak to eight on Thursday, are the fastest team to 47 wins in NHL history.
Nikita Kucherov became the fastest player to 100 points in a season since Mario Lemieux, and he and Steven Stamkos scored in the shootout to lift the Tampa Bay Lightning over the Buffalo Sabres 2-1 on Thursday night.
We're used to delayed gratification in the NHL, but the Lightning have waited long enough to be crowned champions.
Kucherov, 25, is in his sixth season with the Lightning and has now reached 100 points for a second straight year. A second-round draft pick of the Lightning in 2011, he is one of three Tampa Bay players -- along with Brayden Point and Stamkos -- among the NHL's top 10 scorers.
Kucherov, who now has four consecutive 30-goal seasons, becomes the sixth active player to record consecutive 100-point seasons, joining Joe Thornton, Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, Alex Ovechkin and Connor McDavid. He is also the fourth Russian-born player to record consecutive 100-point seasons in NHL history, joining Pavel Bure, Malkin and Ovechkin.

26265503,"The Senators traded all three of their top goal scorers at the deadline in Stone, Matt Duchene and Ryan Dzingel.
While the return for Duchene and Dzingel from Columbus centered on draft picks, Ottawa received a potential star in Brannstrom from Vegas. He was selected 15th overall in 2017 by the Golden Knights and is considered an elite puck-moving defensive prospect. The Knights also sent forward Oscar Lindberg and a second-round pick.
Brannstrom played 41 games with the Chicago Wolves of the AHL before the trade, scoring seven goals and adding 21 assists. In five games with Belleville since the deal, he has an assist.
The Sweden native also played for his country in the world junior championships this year and had four goals in five games.

26230954,"That doesn't mean the Buffalo Sabres captain has to agree with it.
""If you look at the hit and look at the rule book, I didn't think it matched up,"" Eichel said following practice Monday. ""It's kind of frustrating.""
Eichel was suspended Sunday following a hearing with the league's department of player safety.
He blamed Soderberg for lowering his head while the two raced for a loose puck along the boards during Colorado's 3-0 victory Saturday. He said Soderberg was reaching for the puck and that his head hit Eichel's back.
The NHL ruled Eichel was to blame because Soderberg didn't change the direction he was heading, while Eichel cut sharply in front of Soderberg to initiate contact.
""While we acknowledge Eichel's argument that Soderberg is low and reaching for the puck, this hit does not meet any of the criteria for unavoidable head contact,"" the league ruled. ""Soderberg is in a low position and reaching out for the puck before Eichel changes his course to initiate this hit.""
Eichel was penalized for an illegal hit. The suspension will cost him more than $107,500 in lost salary.
Sabres coach Phil Housley backed Eichel, who leads the team with a career-best 72 points (25 goals, 47 assists) in 65 games.
""I don't agree with the decision, but we'll have to live with it, and that's all I'm going to say about that,"" Housley said.
Alexander Nylander is expected to replace Eichel in the lineup after the 2016 first-round draft pick was called up from the minors.
The Sabres host Dallas on Tuesday and have tumbled out of the playoff race by going 2-8-2 in their past 12 games.

26237795,"Greg Wyshynski, senior NHL writer: Tampa Bay Lightning, Washington Capitals, Nashville Predators, San Jose Sharks.
The Lightning are the juggernaut that the NHL needs, but their journey to the Stanley Cup Final should be as difficult as possible. So after dispatching either the second- or third-best team in the Eastern Conference in the second round -- thanks, absurd NHL playoff bracketing! -- the next trial on the Lightning's journey needs to be the defending champion. Not only because the psychologically unburdened Capitals would be attempting to make history of their own, matching the Penguins' back-to-back Cups and positioning themselves into something dynastic, but because they embarrassed the Lightning with back-to-back shutouts to end last season's conference final. Alex Ovechkin versus Nikita Kucherov isn't a bad aspect to this matchup, either.
Who has the best playoff chances? What teams are poised to land Jack Hughes with the No. 1 pick? Projections for both, plus the most important games today.
The Lightning are running away in the NHL's regular-season race. But they do have some weaknesses that can be exploited in the playoffs.
The big names have been traded, but the prospect system is the NHL's best. What should Senators GM Pierre Dorion do this summer?
In the West, the Sharks are by far the most compelling story: a team of veterans chasing their first Cups, as well as the first for this frustrated franchise. (They're basically the new version of ""Washington Capitals West"" in that regard.) Plus, they play a nasty brand of physical hockey, which would make a battle with the Predators such a fun one now that the latter team has muscled up. A series between two star-studded teams, the two best blue lines in hockey (outside of Tampa) and two home arena atmospheres that are second to none. Oh, and suspect postseason goaltending on either side that could turn this into a throwback-style goal frenzy.
Emily Kaplan, national NHL reporter: New York Islanders, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vegas Golden Knights, Winnipeg Jets.
What's a dish best served in the Stanley Cup playoffs? Revenge. The Islanders versus Maple Leafs in the Eastern Conference final would be delicious for reasons I don't need to fully rehash. The spotlight doesn't only have to burden John Tavares, though. New York coach Barry Trotz, after knocking off his former team (the Caps) in the previous round, can prove he's worth the money Washington didn't want to pay him by winning a second straight title. Isles GM Lou Lamoriello can get the last laugh on the Maple Leafs after they gently pushed him aside for a younger hockey mind, Kyle Dubas. Toronto, one of the league's most dynamic offenses, would be tested against the regular season's stingiest defense. And of course, it would be Auston Matthews' coming-out party to a national American audience.
In the West, the Jets can extract revenge on the team that ousted them last season; in the 2018 conference final, Winnipeg -- thanks to the playoff format that pitted the Jets in a second-round slugfest against the Predators -- looked gassed. Winnipeg and Toronto would be looking to snap Canada's 25-year Stanley Cup drought, while Vegas and New York are American teams arriving ahead of schedule to spoil the party.
Chris Peters, NHL draft and prospects writer: Tampa Bay Lightning, Pittsburgh Penguins, Vegas Golden Knights, Nashville Predators.
I don't know if you could ask for a more star-studded Eastern Conference final than one with the Lightning and Penguins. It also provides some of that dramatic narrative with the Penguins being well-traveled and highly decorated in recent postseasons, and the Lightning still trying to get over the hump. The on-paper matchup is still pretty lopsided in favor of the Bolts, but I think this kind of series would generate a ton of eyeballs and it would allow a greater national audience a chance to experience the thrill ride that is Tampa Bay Lightning hockey right now.

On the other side, I think a Vegas-Nashville series would be fun due to the energy of the fan bases, the quality of the teams and the impressive building jobs both general managers have done. The Golden Knights went all-in on both the offseason and deadline trade markets, while the Predators have been nibbling around the edges thanks to a deep roster. I think the visuals of both series would be entertaining, the hockey would be fast-paced and fierce, and who would complain about traveling back and forth between Nashville and Vegas?
Dimitri Filipovic, hockey analytics writer: Tampa Bay Lightning, Washington Capitals, San Jose Sharks, Winnipeg Jets.
You almost can't go wrong with any permutation of the top handful of teams out West. Just for the sake of being different and not completely regurgitating what my co-workers have already covered above, I'll go with Winnipeg and San Jose as my West final. The allure of that matchup is rather obvious. Both teams have a ton of offensive firepower, currently ranked as the second- and sixth-highest-scoring groups, respectively. There will be plenty of goals involved, which will help draw in larger audiences. While those extra eyeballs are there, they'll get to see hockey being played at its absolute peak form. When they're humming, both the Sharks and Jets play at an incredibly high pace, which is even more impressive considering that neither concedes anything in the size department to do so. They can each beat you with their speed and skill in the blink of an eye, but they can also progressively wear you down with their functional physicality in the high-traffic areas. Regardless of what your personal interests may be, they both have something to indulge any hockey fan.

Out East, it feels like it's all about setting up Tampa Bay's long-belated coronation this postseason. The predictability of it is slightly concerning, because playoff hockey constantly reminds us about how cruel and random it can be, but the Lightning have been so much better than everyone else that they should be able to overcome that curse through sheer talent alone. If we're trying to line up the most satisfying road map for them to follow en route to slaying their demons and finally getting over that hump, then you can take your pick between the Penguins and Capitals as their conference final opposition. I'll go with Washington just because of the most recent history between the two. The fact that the Capitals are attempting to defend their title adds an extra layer of intrigue to the equation. All across the board, the two teams present intriguing matchups for each other, and I certainly wouldn't mind seeing them go at it again for seven games.
Sachin Chandan, ESPN the Magazine researcher: Tampa Bay Lightning, Columbus Blue Jackets, Winnipeg Jets, San Jose Sharks.
The Lightning should run away with the Presidents' Trophy, and could capture the Hart Trophy through leading scorer Nikita Kucherov (among other hardware for various players). Thanks to the playoff structure, their second-round matchup will be a challenge, against Toronto or Boston. As for the Blue Jackets, who have been sputtering since the trade deadline, I want to see a team be rewarded for going all-in with this group of Sergei Bobrovsky, Artemi Panarin and Matt Duchene. The NHL needs at least one Cinderella per year, right?
In the west, San Jose is my ""let's root for the vet who hasn't won it yet"" team, with Joe Thornton, Joe Pavelski, Brent Burns and others all in that role. For the Jets, Patrik Laine has nine points in his last nine games after an extended slump, and the addition of Kevin Hayes has elevated the second line with Kyle Connor and Nikolaj Ehlers. Home-ice advantage is critical, as the Jets have an NHL-best 31.0 percent power play at home while the Sharks are a West-leading 23-5-5 at the Shark Tank.

26153006,"How we rank: The ESPN hockey editorial staff submits polls ranking teams 1-31, and those results are tabulated to the list featured here. Teams are rated through Tuesday night's games, taking into account overall record, recent success and other factors such as injuries.
Previous ranking: 1
The lack of state income tax. Look, there are many reasons why players choose to play in Tampa, from the great weather to the even better owner. But the reason so many of them sign for reasonable cap hits is because that money goes further in Florida. Getting Nikita Kucherov, the likely MVP, in at $9.5 million per season through 2027? Incredible. This is the prime reason many expect the Bolts will be able to retain the services of Brayden Point. The tax thing, we mean, not centering Kucherov. Although that certainly doesn't hurt.
Previous ranking: 2
Johnny Hockey Is 25. Johnny Gaudreau is going to be a Hart Trophy finalist in a season where he's going to set career highs in goals and points. The league has trended in the direction for players of his skill set (and dimensions), and his star is blazing.
Previous ranking: 4
Jake DeBrusk. In about five years, hanging on to DeBrusk while trading away Ryan Donato will seem like one of those no-brainer decisions, while completely ignoring the fact that he very much could have been shipped out at any point in the past two seasons.
Previous ranking: 3
Things are starting to really come together. Erik Karlsson injury concerns aside, the Sharks are really starting to look like a team that could hoist the Stanley Cup this season. And by that, of course, we mean Martin Jones putting together a dozen games that aren't grotesque.
Previous ranking: 5
Mitch Marner. Sure, the contract speculation grows more uncomfortable by the day, mostly because Brad Marchand has decided to become Pat Brisson in his spare time. But Marner's breakout season -- 81 points in 66 games -- and undeniable good guy-ness off the ice has made the 21 one of the season's breakout stars.
Previous ranking: 7
The forwards, going forward. Assuming Patrik Laine signs long term and isn't poached with an offer sheet of maximum money and Fortnite V-bucks, the Jets are going to have him, Mark Scheifele, Blake Wheeler, Nikolaj Ehlers and Bryan Little under contract through 2024.
Previous ranking: 8
That term. The year is 2021. Ryan Johansen, Filip Forsberg, Viktor Arvidsson, Kyle Turris (if he's still there), P.K. Subban, Ryan Ellis and Mattias Ekholm are still under contract (and hopefully Roman Josi has inked a new one back in 2020). No matter what happens this season, the Predators are going to have a foundation on which to build contenders for a few more years.
Previous ranking: 9
Russian Machine never breaks. Stanley Cup hangover (figuratively and literally)? New fatherhood? The creeping specter of age? All Alex Ovechkin is doing is having one of his finest goal-scoring seasons of his career.
Previous ranking: 6
No one will ever leave Long Island again. After what the fans put John Tavares through in his return to Nassau Coliseum, what player would be brave enough to ever leave this franchise again? Granted, we're also not sure who would be compelled to sign there knowing what could happen if they do leave, but nevertheless ...
Previous ranking: 12
Sid's got this. Crosby has 86 points in 63 games, and every time you watch Pittsburgh you can watch him attempting to will a broken, underwhelming group into the postseason. Don't worry, dear Penguins fans. Sid will find a way.
Previous ranking: 13
Martin Necas. The center is ranked No. 4 on Chris Peters' list of the top NHL prospects, and expectations are he could be a No. 1 center for the Hurricanes in the very near future.
Previous ranking: 15
Mark Stone. The fact the Knights landed Stone and signed him long term made them a winner at this deadline, because few wingers have the two-way game Stone possesses. He's going to be an integral part of a championship team there one day.
Previous ranking: 14
The Blue Jackets are playing scared. The Canadiens have played well enough to earn the last wild card in the East, with Columbus right behind them. The difference, however, are expectations: Montreal has exceeded them, and the Blue Jackets are currently being crushed by them after an active trade deadline.
Previous ranking: 11
The turnaround isn't a fluke. The Blues aren't out of the woods yet in the competitive Western Conference, although their games-in-hand situation is pretty rosy. But they have shown that the winning stream was a symptom of the overall improvement of their play, rather than an anomaly.
Previous ranking: 10
Fortune favors the bold. We're just going to keep repeating this as a mantra until the Jackets' courageous deadline moves manifest into a playoff spot. Granted, it was famously used by Turnus in Virgil's ""Aeneid"" before he was murdered in a duel to the death. But maybe things work out better for Columbus.
Previous ranking: 16
Maybe the Nino Niederreiter trade was the nadir. Hey, everyone deserves a mulligan, and GM Paul Fenton made a pretty good trade for Kevin Fiala.
Previous ranking: 17
Their team president hasn't publicly compared any of their players to horse excrement in at least the past two months. Which means ""it worked,"" we guess.
Previous ranking: 18
Carter Hart. Until Jordan Binnington stole his spotlight, Hart was the rookie goalie sensation of 2019. As it stands, he's a top 25 prospect in the NHL and the first potential franchise goalie the Flyers have developed in a very long time.
Previous ranking: 19
Ottawa is terrible. The Senators auctioned off their three top scorers, fired their coach and are playing out the string, looking very much as if they'll end up No. 31 in the NHL. That would give the Avalanche, who own the Sens' first-rounder after the Matt Duchene trade in 2017, around an 18.5 percent chance of getting the first overall pick. Playoff-bound or not, the Avalanche have a Christmas in June ahead of them.
Previous ranking: 20
Hey, they've overcome injuries before. Derek Stepan is out at least a month, just as other members of the Coyotes are starting to get healthy. They've been through injury Armageddon and are right in the playoff hunt. Keep the faith!
Previous ranking: 21
OK, next year is the year. They have an amazing top line. They have a franchise defenseman. It seems as if the goaltending has been figured out. Let's give GM Jason Botterill one more summer to ramp this up ... and then if it doesn't work, maybe then we panic.
Previous ranking: 22
Stan Bowman. Every time we want to write off the Blackhawks' GM, he pulls off a series of smart little moves like the ones that added Drake Caggiula and Dylan Strome to the roster. It might not change the overall trajectory of the cap-saddled team, but it helps.
Previous ranking: 23
Artemi Panarin and Sergei Bobrovsky weren't traded. Hence, they weren't signed to contract extensions, and hence they're still going to be unrestricted free agents this summer. And they both love South Beach.
Previous ranking: 26
Maybe the next GM can fix things. The hapless reign of Peter Chiarelli is over, and a new general manager will take over the Oilers this summer. Maybe a new voice and a new perspective can put a playoff team around Connor McDavid. Or maybe it'll just be another Hockey Canada crony that does the bidding of the team's higher-ups. Hopefully the former.
Previous ranking: 24
Elias Pettersson. Well, obviously. He's a point-per-game rookie who has electrified fans with what he does on the ice and sent a jolt through the organization. Usually after a franchise sees the end of an era, like the retirement of the Sedins, it takes a few years before the next thing arrives. Not so much with Vancouver.
Previous ranking: 25
The summer of 2020. As of right now, the Rangers have as much salary committed to the 2020-21 season as they do open cap space. The rebuild is rolling on. But that's a preposterous amount of cap space with which to play in the next two years.
Previous ranking: 27
Maybe Cory Schneider isn't done? When it comes to the team's embattled 32-year-old netminder, any good news is great news. So his 4-3-0 February with a .935 save percentage and a 2.11 goals-against average was great news for a player signed through 2022.
Previous ranking: 28
Bob Murray's evaluation process. One hopes that his time behind the bench gives the general manager the proper insight into how to get this franchise back on the right path.
Previous ranking: 30
Jaret Anderson-Dolan. The future is bright for one of the Kings' top prospects, who is now racking up points for the WHL's Spokane Chiefs.
Previous ranking: 29
Offer sheets are a thing. If the Red Wings wanted to get aggressive, they have the picks and the payroll to really make a scene this summer with any of the pending restricted free agents. No, it wouldn't make them any friends, but Ken Holland doesn't need them. He needs wins.
Previous ranking: 31
Gary Bettman says that Ottawa isn't going to be relocated. So they have that going for them, which is nice.

26046596,"Player X is in the NHL. After home games, he has a routine. Typically, he'll meet a few teammates at a local restaurant for a late dinner. He likes to order steak after games -- medium rare, with a side salad and mashed potatoes. Then he'll go home.
Player X sometimes has a hard time unwinding; it was a day of unbounded stimulation. He woke up and arrived at the rink for a morning skate and meetings, went home to nap, returned to the arena for warm-ups (bright lights and eardrum-blasting music), then exerted his body for 20-something sub-one-minute shifts during which he shoves, sprints, reaches, shoots, gets hit and sometimes bleeds on the ice. By the time he gets home at night, he needs something to ease the process of getting to bed. So he'll often reach for his weed pen and take a few hits. ""Just to relax,"" he says. ""Honestly, it's the easiest and most natural way for me to fall asleep and be ready for the next day.""
Because Player X is on a Western Conference team based in a state in which there are broad laws legalizing marijuana, he knows he's not doing anything wrong. Actually, he's doing what he estimates thousands of others who live in his city do every night as well.
And because he plays in the NHL -- and not, say, the NFL, NBA or MLB -- he knows he won't be punished.
Society's views on marijuana are evolving -- fast. On Oct. 16, Canada became the largest country in the world to legalize recreational marijuana. Coupled with results from the midterm elections in the United States, this is the landscape: Of the 31 teams in the NHL, 28 play in states where players have access to legal marijuana, whether it is for medicinal or recreational purposes. That's the highest percentage (90.3) of any of the major four North American pro leagues, but hardly an anomaly.
This might surprise you: Of the 123 teams across MLB, the NBA, NHL and NFL, 45 play in states or provinces where recreational marijuana is legal (36.6 percent). Another 56 play in jurisdictions where medical marijuana is legal (45.5 percent). That's a whopping 82 percent of teams (101 of 123) that are playing in areas where their employees can legally purchase either medicinal or recreational marijuana.
In fact, the only places in which any of the four major pro league teams play where there are no broad laws legalizing marijuana are Indiana, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin. That list could shrink soon.
Legislation for legalizing medical marijuana in North Carolina is expected this year. Recently elected Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers advocated for legalizing medicinal marijuana on his official campaign website. There have been political hurdles in Texas, though a current bill on the table calls to decriminalize small amounts, which could open the door for more marijuana-friendly legislation. Even though bills in Nashville to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana were shot down by then-Gov. Bill Haslam, a new statewide bill is up for approval, proposing the same thing.
Yet drug policies in most of these leagues are still punishing players for consuming cannabis. All four drug policies are collectively bargained between the leagues and their respective players' unions.
Let's take a quick tour of NFL, MLB and NBA policies compared to the NHL's:
• NFL players with no previous violations are tested just once in the offseason. During the regular season, 10 players per team are randomly selected each week. A positive test means a referral to the substance abuse program. A second violation results in a fine of two game checks. A third violation is four game checks. The fourth violation is a four-game suspension. The fifth violation is a 10-game suspension, and the sixth violation results in a one-year banishment.
Dallas Cowboys pass-rusher Randy Gregory bottomed out a year ago and sought help for depression, drugs and other issues. Today, he is playing football again, fighting to stay clean and help his team to the playoffs. It's December, and there's hope.
The league did relax its stance somewhat in 2014, when it upped the minimum levels for a positive test from 15 nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood or urine to 35 nanograms. Wide receiver Josh Gordon (currently suspended indefinitely) and Dallas Cowboys defensive end Randy Gregory (who went 616 days between regular-season games because of suspensions) are cautionary tales of what happens once you are flagged in the system.
• The NBA does not test its players for marijuana in the offseason. Players are subject to four random tests during the regular season. A first positive test means a player must enter the marijuana program. The second positive test calls for a $25,000 fine. The third infraction is a five-game suspension, and five more games are added to each ensuing violation (10 games for a fourth positive test, 15 games for a fifth, etc.).
• MLB's marijuana policy is a bit different. The league does not test players for drugs of abuse. It only conducts testing on drugs such as marijuana if the MLB or union officials have ""reasonable cause"" to do so. MLB's threshold is 50 nanograms/milliliter. If a player tests positive, he might be subject to a treatment plan that can include progressive fines of up to $35,000 for one test. A player will be suspended only if they ""flagrantly disregard the rules,"" or are believed to be a ""threat"" to fellow players' safety.
Minor league players, who are not covered in the CBA, are regularly tested and face steep fines for positive tests -- and there's little recourse. For example, in 2018, St. Louis Cardinals prospect Griffin Roberts received a 50-game suspension. ""I'd like to apologize to the St. Louis Cardinals Organization and fans for violating MiLB's drug testing policy for cannabis,"" Roberts wrote in a tweet.
The NHL's stance? Officials from both the NHL and NHLPA say the goal of their testing procedures is not to punish offenders but rather identify those who need help and offer them help. ""In today's world, I think we're largely consistent with how people are approaching these things,"" NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said. ""For a program that was originally developed in 1996, when the world was a lot different, it was extremely progressive in terms of how we dealt with these issues.""
Added NHLPA executive director Donald Fehr: ""There's two different kinds of chemical substances, for lack of a better word. There are those that people feel can or do affect performance, and then you have others that can or may be abused. Then you have questions of legality. We live in a culture in which, when it comes to the latter thing, generationally there has been and continues to be an ongoing shift in attitudes. You want to try to reflect that. From a personal standpoint -- and this is personal -- I don't think there ought to be an intrusion into somebody's life without an awfully good reason.""
How the NHL is different? Well, pretend you're Player X. He is subject to teamwide, no-notice testing once during training camp and once during the regular season. He can also be selected for random testing during the regular season and playoffs. Say his team makes the playoffs this season. He might be randomly tested, but only a maximum of 60 players are.
If the NHL or NHLPA has information including reasonable cause that he took a prohibited substance, he could also be subject to a test. Around 2,300 urine tests are taken in a given year.
So what exactly are they testing for?
Up until the 2016-17 season, all urine tests were screened for substances on the NHL/NHLPA's banned list. Then, 30 percent of those tests were given additional screening, looking for drugs of abuse -- such as cocaine or marijuana. This is called survey testing.
However, a change was made in July 2016. Now labs screen 100 percent of the urine tests for drugs of abuse. When asked for the impetus for the change, Daly said the league had wanted to do this for some time. (Any change in policy must jointly be agreed upon between the league and players' association). However, it should be noted that in October 2015, Daly said in an interview with TSN that he was concerned about the number of cocaine positives the league was seeing in survey testing.
Here's where things get interesting: Let's say Player X's test comes back positive for a drug of abuse (which it very well might considering his propensity for the weed pen). He is not going to be punished.
Dr. Dave Lewis and Dr. Brian Shaw are the physicians who run the NHL and NHLPA's joint Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health (SABH) Program. If they determine Player X's test features ""abnormally high levels"" of THC, they flag it. The veil of anonymity is then lifted, and the two doctors will contact Player X. They can recommend he enters the SABH, in which they'll develop an individualized treatment plan for him. Neither the NHL nor NHLPA needs to know that he's in the program.
The league won't punish Player X at all for his test. If he chooses to enter the SABH, Dr. Lewis and Dr. Shaw have the power to levy fines, suspensions or other penalties if conditions are breached. However, the player is not required to enter the program if he doesn't want to.
""The thing that we're really looking for is if there's a guy that has an issue or a problem and he needs help -- that's what we're trying to capture in that program,"" says longtime NHL defenseman Mathieu Schneider, now a senior executive at the NHLPA. ""I do think it has worked very well. We have a tremendous amount of faith in the doctors that run the program. Confidentiality in that program is of the utmost importance.""
This NHL season began with the best player in the world asking, why wouldn't you look into the benefits of marijuana?
""I say this more talking about the CBD side of it, obviously: You'd be stupid not to at least look into it,"" Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid told The Associated Press in a preseason interview. ""When your body's sore like it is sometimes, you don't want to be taking pain stuff and taking Advil all the time. There's obviously better ways to do it. ... You're seeing a lot of smart guys look into it. You're seeing a lot of really smart doctors look into it. If all the boxes are checked there and it's safe and everything like that, then I think you would maybe hear them out.""
But to McDavid's point, it's not as simple as smoking pot. It's important to understand a bit about cannabis. As outlined in an Oct. 16 memorandum to NHL teams -- on the eve of Canada's broad legalization -- CBD is a type of compound, called a cannabinoid, which comes from the plant cannabis sativa L. (or, as it is commonly known, marijuana). Another type of cannabinoid is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis. CBD is purported to provide certain health-related benefits, such as pain relief, while lacking the psychoactive properties of THC. In late December 2018, President Donald Trump signed the farm bill into law, essentially making hemp-based CBD oil legal. However, there are three states that refuse to abide by the federal government's classifications: Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota.
THC is considered a drug of abuse. If a player is tested with ""high levels,"" he will be referred to the SABH program for evaluation. Even though CBD is not on the banned substance list, the Oct. 16 memorandum warned players that ""it is not uncommon for CBD products manufactured in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam to be contaminated with drugs of abuse or prohibited substances."" Therefore, players who use a CBD product might be at risk. Even with increased interest in cannabis products, the NHL did not see a need to revise its policy.
The NHL did not put an edict out to team doctors of Canadian-based teams of whether they can or cannot prescribe cannabis products, though it will be interesting to see whether any do, considering the consequences of carrying cannabis across international borders. Players, of course, can seek out treatment on their own outside the confines of an NHL facility.
The medical properties of cannabis are continuously being explored. Last week, the NHL alumni association signed an agreement with a Canadian cannabis company to determine whether it can help ex-players quit opioids. Over the next year, 100 NHL players in the Toronto area will participate in a double blind randomized study; if the results are encouraging, the company will fund a second study.
Is the NHL's marijuana policy the model of the future? The NFL's CBA expires after the 2020 season, and it's believed the drug policy will be a major discussion point. The NFLPA probably will argue for something similar to the NHL's policy -- test for marijuana, but don't punish it -- and it will be worth monitoring if the NFL agrees. The NBA and NBPA have had ongoing discussions about their marijuana policy, with commissioner Adam Silver seemingly open to reform, being quoted several times as saying, ""We should follow the science.""
There are potential pitfalls to the NHL's policy. The league's lax attitude on marijuana is one thing. However, some have raised concerns about the same loose attitude toward other drugs of abuse. If the NHL really had concern about a cocaine problem in the league, does this policy do anything to help? What about prescription pills? One veteran NHL agent raised this point, while noting entry into the SABH is voluntary. Though the appointed doctors can highly encourage a player to enter the program, the player ultimately has the ability to say no and refuse treatment.
""It hurts to say this, because I am always on the players' side and advocating for players, and I would never advocate for a situation for a team to increase the ability to discipline a player, but there are a lot of players who act recklessly,"" the agent says. ""I think cocaine is still a huge problem in the league. I think there are other drugs that players are abusing. If it was known the league was testing and punishing for cocaine, levels of Ambien, Adderall and a whole list of other list of drugs that get abused, I think you would naturally have players cutting down on it. Unless players face a suspension or loss of pay, what would get their attention?""
Which brings us back to Player X. ""I think it comes down to this -- we are elite athletes and as long as it's not performance-enhancing or illegal, we know what's best for our own bodies,"" he says. ""I find that a couple hits of weed at night is good for me. It's legal, it's natural, I don't see anything wrong with it.""

X factors | Playoff race calls
Upset watch | What to watch
Greg Wyshynski, senior NHL writer: Rick Tocchet is getting Jack Adams buzz for coaching an injury-plagued Arizona Coyotes team to the wild-card bundle, and you can tell he's a true Coach of the Year candidate because it's a goalie who's actually propping up the team. Darcy Kuemper has been really outstanding since taking the crease in December. In his last 18 appearances, he's 12-5-1 with a .927 save percentage. Kuemper has a 14.69 goals-saved above average this season and is in the top 10 for goalies in point shares (the number of standings points contributed by a player) with 9.2.
He's been the Coyotes' MVP and will have to continue to be for Arizona to make the playoff cut. It's pretty incredible to think that the Coyotes acquired him last deadline for Tobias Rieder, who is currently with the Edmonton Oilers and doesn't have a goal in 56 games this season.
Who has the best playoff chances? What teams are poised to land Jack Hughes with the No. 1 pick? Projections for both, plus the most important games today.
On second thought, Patrice Bergeron & Co. do get enough love. Plus, the Week in Gritty, Jersey Fouls and more.
Dimitri Filipovic, hockey analytics writer: Sidney Crosby. He's been doing it for so long that we almost take his greatness for granted at this point, but Crosby is currently putting the finishing touches on a vintage individual season. No player has more primary 5-on-5 points than his 46 this season, which speaks to the nearly unparalleled direct impact he's had on his team's offensive output.
The Pittsburgh Penguins' play with him on the ice versus when he's on the bench has been night and day this season. In the roughly 1,050 5-on-5 minutes he's played, they're up 75-35 on the scoreboard. In the 2,370 minutes he hasn't been out there, they're down 87-100. Whether it's been Dominik Simon or Bryan Rust or most recently Jared McCann, whoever has gotten to play on his wing has their production skyrocket to whole new heights.
Crosby himself has really ratcheted his game up a level of late, registering 10 goals and 19 assists over his past 16 games. The Penguins have unsurprisingly gone 10-3-3 during that time, going from the edge of the playoff bubble to having a realistic chance at winning the Metropolitan Division. If he can keep this up and carry the team up the standings, he'll be well deserving of some late-season MVP buzz.
Victoria Matiash, fantasy analyst: He's saying all the right things after ugly losses to the Lightning and Blackhawks, but now Auston Matthews must lead his club by example. The Toronto Maple Leafs' best player needs to perform as such, at both ends of the ice, and score with greater regularity.
Sitting four points back of the Bruins, themselves losers of three straight, Toronto has failed to take advantage in the fight for home ice. That has to change. Bet your bottom Canadian dollar, once Matthews erupts for a multipoint night (the goal and assist after falling behind 5-0 early to Chicago on Wednesday doesn't count), the rest of the Leafs' lineup will follow. While having a healthy Jake Gardiner and Travis Dermott back on the blue line is essential for this club to have any chance against Boston, the cream of Toronto's forward crop must play to their peak before then. And that starts with No. 34.
Ben Arledge, associate NHL editor: You could name just about any goalie here: Jordan Binnington, Petr Mrazek, Ben Bishop, Sergei Bobrovsky, Carey Price and so on. But moving outside the crease, I think Carolina's Sebastian Aho ends up being the most important skater down the stretch. The winger currently leads his team with 30 goals and 77 points while skating 20 minutes per night. According to Natural Stat Trick, Aho is third on the team in relative Corsi at plus-8.7, and the team scores 2.4 more goals per 60 minutes when he is skating (highest on the Canes).
The Hurricanes sit in a playoff berth by two points, not only trying to hold off a pair of challengers for the wild-card spots but also trying to catch the Penguins in the third Metropolitan seat. It's a very tight race, and with the Canes' offense running through Aho, they will need him at his best for the final month.

Sachin Chandan, ESPN the Magazine researcher: In the past month, captain Joe Pavelski has led the San Jose Sharks in goals and points while they are locked into a razor-thin race with the Flames for top seed. Earlier in the week, he scored a game winner against the Jets with 4.3 seconds left, and he's on the doorstep of scoring 40 goals for the first time since 2014. The Sharks have the best record in the West at home, and the race for the top seed is critical to their chances of making the Cup Final. With the Sharks dealing with injuries, they'll need Pavelski to play a critical role with games coming up against Nashville and Vegas.
Wyshynski: The Montreal Canadiens make the playoffs. This really isn't what anybody outside of Montreal wants, given that the playoffs are a much more interesting place with the Blue Jackets, Hurricanes and Penguins in them, but Montreal just keeps chugging along. And check the schedule: The Habs have four-point-swing games against the Hurricanes and Jackets, and their last three games (Tampa, Washington and Toronto) could see those teams resting key players down the stretch. I would be happy to be wrong here, but I think there's a better chance that Montreal stays steady than either the Hurricanes or the Blue Jackets don't flake down the stretch.
Filipovic: The Colorado Avalanche make the playoffs. It's not necessarily that bold considering they're only five points out of a playoff spot at the moment, but this time of year it's immensely difficult to make up any sort of real ground considering how loser points are being handed out like candy on a nightly basis. They'll also need to leapfrog a pair of teams to do so.
The good news for the Avalanche is that they have a direct say in their own destiny because they still have meetings with the Wild, Stars and Coyotes. They also have juicy matchups against bottom-feeders like the Ducks, Devils and Blackhawks, all of whom they should feast on. They're certainly facing an uphill battle without Gabriel Landeskog in the lineup, but their goaltending appears to have rebounded from a midseason malaise. After completely falling off the face of the earth in December and January, their goalies have bounced back to the top 10 of both 5-on-5 and all situations save percentage since the start of February. The Avs need that to continue if they're going to make a spirited run down the stretch.
Matiash: The Chicago Blackhawks make the playoffs. And not only because Patrick Kane is producing at a ridiculous pace. The entire lineup is clearly buying what newbie coach Jeremy Colliton is peddling. Together, Jonathan Toews and Brandon Saad are enjoying solid rebound campaigns, and fans of our fantasy content will be familiar with my affection for the underrated young forward duo of Alex DeBrincat and Dylan Strome. Finally healthy, goalie Corey Crawford -- and this I did not anticipate at all -- is looking like his old self. Winning games against both stronger and weaker sides, these experienced Blackhawks have a perceptible edge on the Coyotes and Landeskog-less Avalanche. I predict they vault the Wild as well.
Arledge: The Arizona Coyotes make the playoffs. Yes, they currently have a three-point lead over the Wild in the Western's final wild-card seat and have a five-point advantage over the Avalanche. Not that bold on the surface. But consider this: They currently do not roster a player with 20 or more goals (Brad Richardson leads the team with 16). Their leading point-getter (Clayton Keller, 45) is tied for 99th in the NHL. Only eight regulars have a positive plus-minus. The team as a whole is 21st in Corsi and its 7.0 even-strength shooting percentage is second worst in the league. Oh, and the No. 1 goaltender at the start of the season, Antti Raanta, hasn't played since November. But none of it matters.
The Coyotes have won 13 of their last 17 riding Kuemper (.930 save percentage following the All-Star break), Vinnie Hinostroza and Alex Galchenyuk. It'd be their first playoff berth since 2012, when Ray Whitney and Shane Doan helped them all the way to the conference finals. Nothing is going to slow this team's momentum.

Chandan: The Minnesota Wild miss the playoffs. They are currently on the outside looking in, and I can't see them climbing back in with a difficult strength of schedule remaining compared to the Stars and Blues. Should the Wild miss, it would end the longest active playoff streak in the Western Conference, as they've made it six years in a row. In fact, the Wild have 10 games remaining against teams currently in the playoffs, a brutal stretch that includes two against the Stars, who are three points ahead of them.

Wyshynski: The Dallas Stars over the Nashville Predators. If you want to take stock of the regular-season series, the Stars were 2-1-2 against the Predators. But give me Bishop, a money postseason goalie who's been waiting four years for another playoff shot, over either of the Predators' netminders in a series. Give me a Stars team ready to get a jolt from a rested and healthy Mats Zuccarello. And don't give me a Nashville team that has looked disjointed for most of the season. We thought it was the injuries. Maybe it isn't.
Filipovic: I'll go with the Carolina Hurricanes taking down the New York Islanders in the opening round. It feels like a bit of a cop-out because the Islanders are such an easy target and aren't even sitting in a position to make this matchup happen right now, but whoever finishes the year winning the Metro seems ripe for an upset by the first wild card. Whether it's the Capitals, Islanders or Penguins, there are some legitimate flaws that can be exposed in a playoff series. And whether it's the Hurricanes, Blue Jackets or even the Canadiens, they each have enough going for them to conceivably take advantage of those opportunities.
That entire side of the playoff bracket is about as wide open as you'll see. I'm going with this particular combination just because it would represent a big win for nerds everywhere, with the first-ranked shot-share team and analytical darling beating the higher-seeded but 22nd-ranked shot-share team.
Arledge: The Carolina Hurricanes over the Washington Capitals. The young up-and-coming team that's earned points in 16 of its last 20 contests knocks off Alex Ovechkin and the defending champions. No wild-card team is taking down the Lightning, and the Jets, Predators, Sharks and Flames probably all have at least one series win in them.
That leaves the Metropolitan Division, where the Caps currently lead the Islanders by two points (and I agree with Dimitri that the Isles would also be a big target here). Washington ought to hold off New York, but if Mrazek gets hot heading into the playoffs, and Aho, Teuvo Teravainen & Co. continue to find ways to score, the Hurricanes will be a pest in late April.

Chandan: The Arizona Coyotes over the Winnipeg Jets would be a wild turn of fate, but I'm a sucker for hot goalies in the playoffs. The Jets have struggled with consistency issues and bad luck, going 4-7-1 in the past month. Connor Hellebuyck has had a lousy .894 save percentage in that span. There's still time to right the ship, but they could be staring at a dangerous matchup. The Coyotes have shocked the NHL with their run into the playoff picture, and as Greg points out above, Kuemper's been the hottest thing in the desert over the past month. Oh, and there are reports that Antti Raanta could be back in the net for the Coyotes come playoff time if Kuemper does start to run cold. I could see this going six or seven.
Wyshynski: Carolina on home ice. The Hurricanes have the most favorable home/road split in the Eastern Conference down the stretch, with eight of their remaining 13 games at PNC Arena. Among those games: Winnable contests against the Sabres, Flyers and Wild; critical ones against Montreal and Pittsburgh; tough ones against Washington and Tampa Bay; and a bye against the Devils.

They've been a better defensive team on home ice (2.66 GAA) than on the road (2.80), and slightly better offensively as well, despite a 15.5 percent conversion rate on the power play at home. It's entirely possible that their playoff seed will be won or lost based on how they feast on these home games. One hopes the fans recognize this and fill the building to cheer on this Bunch of Jerks.
Filipovic: I've already written about this at greater length, but the battle between the Sharks and Flames for not only Pacific Division supremacy but also the No. 1 seed out West is what I'll be watching. There's currently one measly point separating the two, and it'll all likely come down to their  meeting in San Jose on March 31. While both teams have already punched their tickets to the postseason regardless of the outcome, the difference between the two possible scenarios should be enough to inspire some added urgency.
Coming out atop the division promises not only a significantly easier matchup in Round 1 but also guarantees home-ice advantage in a potential Round 2 meeting. Considering that it could very plausibly be the difference between a disappointing first-round exit and a Western Conference final appearance, it's a race that warrants our undivided attention.
Matiash: John Tortorella's handling of the Blue Jackets. With Columbus, Montreal and Carolina in a heated battle for the pair of wild-card spots in the East, it's going to get tense. For the average hockey fan, it sets the stage for terrific theater with Tortorella as a leading cast member. How does he get more out of ex-Senators Matt Duchene and Ryan Dzingel? How does he manage Bobrovsky's workload and confidence? How does he handle questions from the media?
There isn't a coach in the playoff mix under more pressure than the Jackets' bench boss, after the organization opted to go all-in ahead of the trade deadline. And this charge could go right down to the wire. Can't wait.
Arledge: Pacific Division starting goalies. The Sharks might be leading the Pacific at the moment with 94 points, but their goaltending duo has been awful. Both Martin Jones and Aaron Dell have save percentages south of .900, and the Sharks' 5-on-5 save percentage is dead last in the NHL. San Jose missed a big opportunity at the trade deadline to pad its crease with someone like Jimmy Howard, and it could end up costing the team dearly. The Sharks are currently giving up more than three goals per night.
Then you have the Flames, who have relied on David Rittich and a fading Mike Smith this season. Rittich has an .882 save percentage and 3.35 goals-against average since the All-Star break, cooling significantly from his hot start. According to Natural Stat Trick, his goals saved above average is just 0.02, 32nd in the NHL among goalies with at least 10 games played. Can he really hold down the fort through the playoffs? Both of these teams are just too good to let down because of mediocre-to-bad goaltending, and Dimitri already pointed out just how important this stretch run is for this pair of clubs, so I'll be looking to see whether one of these guys can get hot in the closing weeks. You don't want to head into the first round still trying to get right in the crease.

26243215,"Here's a two-minute oral history of the night that the new king of Philadelphia was born.
(To see the actual viral moment, scroll to the bottom of this story.)
Brian Allen, Gritty's designer: The only guidance the Flyers gave us was that they were pretty sure they wanted the mascot to be a monster -- somebody you'd want to high-five but not hug.
Christine Mina, digital media manager for the Flyers: That whole first day we were very on-the-fly, creating the plane as we were flying it. Tons of people were getting involved in the conversation -- our rival, the Penguins, tweeted ""lol ok"" at us, and Gritty tweeted, ""Sleep with one eye open tonight, bird."" That's when his first bit of real personality came out.
Lou Nolan, Flyers PA announcer in his 46th season: For the first game, I wasn't sure where or when he would be coming out. Suddenly there's what looks like a 7-foot-5 orange character walking out onto the ice. I don't think fans knew what to do at first.
Gritty, through a mascot interpreter: All I remember is falling on the ice. Ice is super hard. Hit my noggin pretty bad. Don't remember much after that. I didn't quite have my ice legs yet. First days are tough -- Claude [Giroux, Philly's team captain and close Gritty confidant] told me so. As for the viral part, I've been checked and I'm clean.play1:13Katie Nolan recalls the moment when mascots turned on GrittyGritty took the internet by storm when he was introduced as the Flyers mascot. But as Katie Nolan points out, other NHL mascots soured on the newcomer.
Gritty took the internet by storm when he was introduced as the Flyers mascot. But as Katie Nolan points out, other NHL mascots soured on the newcomer.
Nolan: When he fell, I don't think he was trying to fall. There was laughter, but he immediately came up with the snow angel, and people loved that.
Lauren Capone, Flyers marketing communications coordinator: By later in that game, there were people running out of their seats to get photos.
Mina: He had over 50,000 followers that night, and he reached 100K within three days of us launching.
Gritty: I don't really like to concern myself with the people who are tweeting about me; it's more about those who aren't tweeting about me. @KimKardashian -- I'll wait ... forever.
Capone: He's like the little kid inside of everybody who wants to push the boundaries. Even when he's out in public or on the concourse at a game, he has no problem bumping a mom with a stroller aside and taking the stroller for a joyride around the concourse.
Mina: Sometimes he looks so cute and sweet in what he's doing. In other moments, he's being such a savage.
Gritty: It all comes down to being a quadruple threat: good looks (360-degree vision provides optimal peripheral vision angles), advanced street magic (not that fake Criss Angel stuff), impeccable BMI (brilliant mascot intuition) and a heart that beats only for the Philadelphia Flyers. They set me free, and now I can't be tamed.

26256298,"The league announced Wednesday it was moving its draft lottery up to April 9, on the eve of the Stanley Cup playoffs. The event, which will take place in Toronto, typically occurred during the playoffs.
The 15 teams that do not make the postseason are eligible for the No. 1 pick. The team with the fewest regular-season points has a 18.5 percent chance at landing the top pick. The team with the second-fewest points has a 13.5 percent chance, and the team with the third fewest has a 11.5 percent chance.
As of Wednesday, the Ottawa Senators had the worst record in the NHL with a league-low 52 points. Unfortunately for the Senators, the Colorado Avalanche own that pick, from last season's deal that sent Matt Duchene to Ottawa.
The 2019 NHL draft will be June 21 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Finnish winger Kaapo Kakko is believed to be the second-highest-rated prospect in the draft.

Bednar called missing Landeskog, a ""huge loss.""
Some teams are eyeing the playoffs. Others, not so much. But there's hope for the future for all of them. Plus, our updated league-wide ranks.
Landeskog, 26, has recorded career highs this season with 33 goals, including a league-leading nine game-winners, and 69 points.

The Avalanche are currently in ninth place in the Western Conference with 70 points, four points behind the Minnesota Wild for the last wild-card spot.

26227036,"The Lightning are a juggernaut. Vegas Insider has set their odds to win the Stanley Cup at 5-2, with no other team better than 9-1. Some see their quest for the championship as an inevitability. That's how dominant they've been.
""They're really talented. They don't have a weakness. They put the fear of God in you,"" said Boudreau.
It turns out that, on occasion, the seemingly supernatural Lightning can look mortal. Boudreau's team shut them out with a 3-0 win, becoming only the second team this season to blank Tampa Bay.
Even the mightiest can fall, and the Lightning are no different. Here are five ways the Lightning can fall short of the championship; please note that ""catastrophic injuries"" are not one of them, but obviously losing star winger Nikita Kucherov, defenseman Victor Hedman, center Steven Stamkos or especially goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy could be devastating.
Earlier this season, Lightning coach Jon Cooper acknowledged that one of his goals for 2018-19 was to get his team playing the kind of defense that wins championships. ""We have to win games 2-1, and not 5-4,"" he said.
Maybe he's just being a realist, because the Lightning are anything but that 5-4 team in their most critical playoff games. In fact, in Games 6 and 7 of their past two Eastern Conference finals losses, the Lightning scored a total of three goals: They scored two in Game 6 and one in Game 7 before being eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016, then were shut out in back-to-back games by the Washington Capitals in 2018.
Who has the best playoff chances? What teams are poised to land Jack Hughes with the No. 1 pick? Projections for both, plus the most important games today.
On pace to challenge the all-time standings point mark, Tampa Bay has been dominant this season. But just how dominant?
The big names have been traded, but the prospect system is the NHL's best. What should Senators GM Pierre Dorion do this summer?
""Our offense has failed us, not our defense. We lost 4-0 to Washington [in Game 7], but if you watch that game, there's an argument that we should have been up 4-0. We lost to Pittsburgh, 2-1,"" said Cooper. ""I think it's something where you have to train your team for 82 games, that you can't just turn it on in the playoffs.""
Look no further than the performances of the Lightning's top scorers in those games. In 2016, Kucherov had 11 goals, eight assists and 51 shots on goal in 15 playoff games; then he went scoreless in Games 6 and 7 against the Penguins, generating three shots in those games. In 2018, Kucherov had seven goals and 10 assists in 15 games with 61 shots on goal. He had one shot in Game 6 and three in Game 7, but failed to register a point. In those four critical games, Kucherov was a minus-7.
Stamkos was injured in 2016, playing only Game 7 against the Penguins and for just over 11 minutes. He had two shots, a minus-1 and no points. In Games 6 and 7 against the Capitals, he was a minus-2 with four shots and no points.
In each of their past two postseason appearances under Cooper, the Lightning have rolled through the first two rounds, winning each of the four series in five games. Both years, they fell in the conference finals in Game 7. The reason is simple: When the postseason's on the line, they can't quite do what they do best.
If you're foolish enough to stand in the center of the ring and trade haymakers with the Lightning, you're eventually going to get knocked out. They simply pack too much power behind their punches for you to play their game and expect to make it out in one piece.
The good news for any prospective opponents is that while they surely won't be able to match Tampa Bay's talent level, sometimes a playoff series can be just as much about the way the two teams match up stylistically as it is about anything else. Against a team that's as prolific offensively as the Lightning, an opponent almost has to go to the complete opposite extreme. It needs to slow the game down to a virtual gridlock, limit the amount of possessions that are traded back and forth, and minimize the number of opportunities Tampa Bay gets in the attacking zone.
We saw the Capitals put on a master class on how that's done last spring, when they ran the gauntlet against the Penguins, Lightning and Golden Knights en route to the Stanley Cup. They managed to trip up some of the league's quickest attacking teams by grinding the game down to a halt in the neutral zone with their vaunted 1-1-3 trap, limiting the opposition's ability to carry the puck into and out of the zone with any real semblance of time and space. As those teams all came to quickly appreciate, it's awfully difficult to get going offensively when you're constantly having to stop and start whenever you get the puck.
To get a better sense of who typically plays fast versus more methodically, we're going to use combined rates of shots generated for and against as a proxy for ""pace."" While it's not necessarily a flawless measure, it at the very least gives us a better general sense of how often events are transpiring when specific teams are involved. Here's how quickly the rest of the teams in the playoff picture are playing this season at even strength via Natural Stat Trick:
Most of the teams we'd typically consider to be Tampa Bay's biggest challengers are stacked up together near the top of the list here. A team like the Maple Leafs can afford to coast through the regular season by playing fast and loose because they have the horses to outscore most opponents. But the Lightning aren't your typical team, and if the Leafs were to get into a seven-game series against them, continuing to play that brand of up-tempo hockey would be playing with fire.
It may not matter, because the talent gap between the two sides is too significant for even the greatest of coaches to overcome, but one thing we know about Barry Trotz is that he has the unparalleled ability to strategically suck the life out of the game with his defensive system.
His impact on the Islanders in his first season with the team is already abundantly obvious: He has taken a club that played at the seventh-fastest pace last season and brought them all the way down to 31st. It's also no coincidence that the Capitals have jumped up from 22nd to seventh in that same period of time since his departure. It'd be fascinating to see what kind of game plan he could concoct with this current group of players to try to once again slow down a superior team.
If there's an offensive category, the Lightning are probably leading the pack in it this season. They're currently on pace to score north of 300 goals, which has been accomplished only three times (the 2009-10 Capitals, 2005-06 Senators and 2005-06 Red Wings) over the past two decades. Kucherov is on pace to put up 130 points, a feat that hasn't been reached since the heyday of Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr, when they were terrorizing the league together in the mid-'90s.
For as lethal as they are at five-on-five, the Lightning ascend to their most terrifying offensive heights on the power play, when they get to load up with the full scope of their embarrassment of riches. Their top unit has given opposing penalty kills nightmares, proving to be a truly unanswerable problem. Because of the way they set up, they essentially wind up forcing you to pick your poison.

With Kucherov serving as a dual threat architect from the half wall, he gets to survey the landscape and direct the puck toward whatever the defense gives him. He's perfectly suited for the role because he's got an excellent shot himself, which forces penalty killers to remain honest and play him straight up. From there his options are: (A) Brayden Point, who leads the league in power-play goals with 19; (B) Steven Stamkos, who is second in power-play goals this season (16) and is arguably the greatest one-shot sniper of his generation; or (C) Victor Hedman, who serves as an absolute hammer from the point. It should come as no surprise that Kucherov is lapping the field in power-play production, and at 28.6 percent, the Lightning have the most efficient power-play conversion rate in 36 years.
Regardless of how teams try to stop them, they have to live with the fact that they'll eventually find a way to score. All that can really be done is to make life difficult for them. The issue is that this involves walking the finest of tightropes while doing so; limiting their space and opportunities, while avoiding penalties.
That's obviously easier said than done. Their top scorers are so dangerous with the puck that they force defenders into compromised positions in which they have to pick between taking a penalty or conceding a goal. Even the players residing lower on the depth chart put you in a bind, with the speed of guys like Mathieu Joseph, Anthony Cirelli and Yanni Gourde being difficult to contain.
Even though there's a conventional belief that referees put their whistles away in the playoffs as the level of physicality heightens, the rate of penalties called is actually relatively in line with what we see throughout the regular season. Any team that hopes to beat the Lightning come the postseason will have to navigate that balancing act delicately and play a disciplined game. The Tampa Bay power play is such a problem that the only palatable solution for defending it is to not give it a chance in the first place.
The notion of the ""hot goalie"" in the playoffs is one that has been up for debate, from whether they exist to whether a run of postseason success has any bearing on whether we're watching what amounts to a ""good"" goalie.
Ken Dryden, a guy who knows a thing or two about torrid postseason goaltending, always believed that a ""hot goalie"" is actually one who has the benefit of playing behind a recommitted defense. ""When playoff energy returns, defense returns. Shooters get harassed and forced to bad angles; rebounds are cleared. Great chances become good chances that good goalies can stop,"" he wrote. ""Every goal not scored seems bigger. Every save made seems better. It's a goalie's time of year.""

That said ... we've all seen this happen, haven't we? Those postseason series when a seemingly inferior opponent pulls an upset against a behemoth because of impenetrable goaltending. When Jean-Sebastien Giguere elevated the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim to the 2003 Stanley Cup Final and earned himself the Conn Smythe. When Jonathan Quick posted one game out of 20 with a save percentage below .900 in backstopping a No. 8-seeded Los Angeles Kings to the Cup in 2012.
And of course, the go-to example for anyone who believes the lowest-seeded playoff team can take down the most intimidating conference leader: Jaroslav Halak's 2010 performance, during which he stopped 94 of 96 shots in Games 6 and 7 to lead Montreal to the 1-versus-8 upset of Washington. ""Some people didn't give us a chance to even win one game. They were wrong,"" said Halak after that Game 7 win.
The hot goaltender is both the agent of chaos in the NHL postseason and the great equalizer. The Lightning could see Carey Price of Montreal, Petr Mrazek and Curtis McElhinney of Carolina or Matt Murray (if healthy) of Pittsburgh. (They could also see Sergei Bobrovsky of Columbus, assuming the heretofore postseason flop gets the nod come playoff time.)
Survive them, and they'll have to contend with Frederik Andersen of Toronto or Tuukka Rask of Boston in the second round -- both very capable of winning a series on their own in back of the two other best teams in the conference. (Thanks, NHL playoff system that's completely inequitable to regular-season top seeds!)
No one can predict when the hot goalie will strike. Heck, he might even be a member of the Lightning this season. But it's one of the reasons why Presidents' Trophy winners have gone on to win the Stanley Cup only eight times, and have reached the Stanley Cup Final only 11 times. (Fun fact: The team with the best regular-season record, like the Capitals in 2010, have lost in the first round six times.)
As the saying goes, the best defense is a good offense, and that certainly applies here. Kucherov is so skilled that the only way to ensure that he's not a scoring threat is to keep him away from the puck and as far from the net as possible. Being a strong possession team goes a long way toward accomplishing that, because every second that he and the Lightning's other top scorers are hemmed in their own zone and being forced to defend is a huge win for the opposition.
That theoretical idea lines up with what we've seen in practice over the years, where there's been a strong link established between the teams that dominate puck possession in the later stages of the regular season and the success they have in the ensuing postseason. With that in mind, here's how all of the teams in the playoff picture have performed from a shot share perspective over the past 25 games. Data is courtesy of Puck on Net:
It's amazing that we're once again headed toward a collision course between the Bruins and Leafs in Round 1, considering that they currently have the second- and fifth-best winning percentages, respectively.
If Boston is able to get by Toronto again, it could potentially present a challenging foe for the Lightning because of its unique combination of skills. The Bruins have the horses up front to match up head-to-head without conceding any ground, the goaltending that will allow them to steal a game or two, and the defensive structure to slow Tampa Bay down.

Even without David Pastrnak in the lineup, they've been particularly dominant lately, going an astounding 15-0-4 over 19 games prior to Sunday's loss in Pittsburgh. Their place on the chart above isn't especially surprising, given that their bread and butter is a suffocating possession game that looks like an older sibling tormenting younger siblings by playing keep-away with them.
The issue is that it's hardly a given that they get their shot against Tampa Bay at all, because the Leafs are a great team in their own right. If the Bruins do beat Toronto, it'll likely be another epic series that goes the full distance. The entire scenario is eerily reminiscent of last year. By the time the Bruins reached the Lightning in the 2018 playoffs, they were a shell of themselves after having had to completely empty the tank against Toronto. The speed discrepancy between the two teams at that point was like night and day.
To avoid the same result, Boston's main priority over the closing weeks of the regular season should be to take a page out of the NBA's playbook by carefully managing the workload of its top players. A fresh Bruins team would certainly give us a much better series than we got in 2018, when the Lightning dispatched them in five games.

26176867,"I thought about that scene after David Backes of the Boston Bruins explained a recent change in his career trajectory, in which the 34-year-old center has become an enforcer of sorts, fighting Micheal Haley of the San Jose Sharks, Adam Erne of the Tampa Bay Lightning and Micheal Ferland of the Carolina Hurricanes in the span of a week.
""I don't know if it's an enforcer role. I think there are times during the season when you have to step up for your teammates. Whether there's a liberty taken or a hard, clean hit, you have to hold them accountable. I asked [coach Bruce Cassidy] during a meeting [if] I could be put in roles to have a better impact on games, whether that's with my gloves off or my gloves on. He's provided me those opportunities,"" Backes explained on Tuesday, after the Bruins' win over Carolina.
This week's episode features two teams on the up-swing. First, Blues forward Ryan O'Reilly talks about the remarkable turnaround in St. Louis this season (12:20). Linda Cohn of adds her thoughts on the Blues, and Jordan ""Winnington"" (23:57). Plus, how was Greg'strip to Long Island for John Tavares' return (29:16)? Then, we catch up with Vegas defenseman Shea Theadore, who talks about Year Two for the Golden Knights franchise (37:45). Listen »
""It's a calculated decision. If I'm going to stay part of this team and part of a winning team, that's maybe going to be part of my role. And I'm OK with it.""
Even a dozen years ago, these comments would have just floated by like spittle through the air after a left hook. Enforcers played their roles, and did so to maintain their ice time. Young players, from David Clarkson to Riley Cote, openly discussed getting their breaks in the NHL because they chose to break faces with their fists in the minor leagues, continuing a decades-long tradition of players literally fighting their way into pro hockey.
In 2019, a fight rouses the crowd while making many hockey fans feel squeamish. Fighting is a relic. A projection from HockeyFights.com earlier this season forecast that less than 17 percent of games would have one; that number was 41.4 percent a decade ago.
Concussions are a reality, and especially for David Backes.
Since signing with the Bruins in 2016, Backes has suffered three concussions, on top of the ones he suffered playing a physical brand of hockey with the St. Louis Blues for 727 games. He was concussed during last year's Stanley Cup playoffs against the Lightning. He was concussed early this season against the Edmonton Oilers, missing two games.
There's a simple solution that can bolster their chances to make some playoff noise. Plus, why the race for the Pacific crown is so important.
Who has the best playoff chances? What teams are poised to land Jack Hughes with the No. 1 pick? Projections for both, plus the most important games today.
An updated look at the players poised for future NHL stardom, led by Colorado defenseman prospect Cale Makar, currently skating for UMass.
Does he have any concerns about taking on a quasi-enforcer role, given that history?
""My wife probably does,"" Backes said this week. ""But that can't be a thought in your head when you're playing in the NHL. She might worry about me driving over 65 miles an hour on the pike, too. Potential car accidents or whatever else that could come.""
Accidents will happen. Fights are voluntary. That's actually the rationale the NHL Department of Player Safety uses when suspending players for hits to the head during play but not hits to the head during a fight. Concussions will happen, too, which is why the NHL instituted a protocol in 2016 (in conjunction with the NHL Players' Association) that uses a series of spotters -- from game officials to people watching on monitors back at NHL HQ -- to identify and remove players from the ice who appear to exhibit ""visible signs"" of having suffered a concussion for further evaluation. It's similar to the NFL's rule on concussion signs, which also removes players for evaluation.
The catalyst here is the league's desire to keep its players from suffering additional catastrophes after being concussed. A desire that wouldn't seem to sync up with what Backes said this week.
But here's the thing with David Backes: He doesn't have his head down on this stuff. Call his decision-making foolish, but know that he's anything but a fool. Fighters in hockey have a way of explaining their craft and explaining away the deleterious effects of it, and Backes is no different.
""You look at the stats, and you're not actually as prone to concussions fighting as you are through whiplash or side hits or shoulders to the face or elbows to the face,"" he said this week.

This is correct. A study of the NHL from 2009 to 2012 found that ""a player was more likely to suffer a concussion by getting hit in the face by a puck than by fighting."" Adam Scorgie, a documentarian who made the film ""Ice Guardians"" about NHL enforcers, once told me that ""the elephant in the room [is] only 5 percent of concussions are coming from fighting. But if you were a general observer of hockey or just an outside fan, you would think with all the media attention on fighting, 'Oh, man, fighting's gotta cause 40 to 50, 60 percent.'""
But again, in 2019 it feels unnecessary. The role of the enforcer is nearly extinct, with only a few dinosaurs still roaming Isla Nublar: Cody McLeod, Mark Borowiecki and Ryan Reaves among them. For Backes to take up the mantle seems antiquated and, within the context of his health, hazardous.
Backes, from back in November, on concussions: ""You start piling them up, and it's not ever fun when or if you have a concussion. But you start piling them up and trying to work through it, and if you're multiplying them on top of each other, then it starts to get dangerous. ... There's a sensitivity level throughout the league and throughout the educated world that you don't want to get hit in the head unnecessarily.""
Many will read that quote and wonder how it squares with Backes deciding to fight more, and it's a legitimate query. There's a certain sadness to the idea that, like a wrestler grappling well past his prime for one last match, a hockey player is willing to risk his latter years for the relevance of the moment.
But in both cases, that ignores the one salient point I return to when considering concussions, hockey, pro sports and the general risk involved in all of it, which is personal choice and the opportunity to make it.

The NHL winkingly allows fighting, penalizing it but never going so far as to ban it. Part of this has always been to avoid the backlash from fans and players, who would revolt against a draconian prohibition of fighting, and part of this is the confidence that it will organically leave the game. But as long as it exists, the choice is there to fight.
We can like it. We can loathe it. Some of us will choose to judge Backes fighting as the wrong decision for himself and his family. But as someone who openly cheered during another three-fight spree for David Backes in 2010 -- when he started throwing fists with Team Canada players ahead of the Vancouver Olympics -- I'm not that judge. The NHL I grew up with was a chaotic one, filled with gruesome brawls and players who only existed to partake in them. It's part of my DNA as a fan. Yes, my views on fighting have changed -- I never have to see another staged fight, but admittedly the ones that happen during the course of play get my adrenaline going -- but I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss it.
Backes grew up in that NHL, too, and he plays in an era when we all know more about concussions than we ever have before. Hence, Backes isn't being forced into this role. He chose it. He isn't forced into this sport. He chose it. Chose the risk, chose the reward. We can sit in judgment of him, but in 2019, if a player with his health history decides to journey down this path, it's ultimately his choice, just as it was his former teammate Rick Nash's choice to end the journey earlier this season, lest there be any more damage to his brain. It's always been his risk.
We watch, we applaud, we cringe, we hope for his good health after the skates are hung up. And we know, inherently, there's always going to be someone else willing to leap off the top rope as long as the job requires it, or as long as fans are willing to pay to watch it.

26235097,"""The NHL is aware of reports that a homophobic slur was used during the Maple Leafs-Lightning game. The league is investigating the incident and will have no further comment until this investigation is completed,"" said the league.
The investigation, and any discipline in the matter, will be handled by the NHL's department of hockey operations.
In the second period of their 6-2 loss to the Lightning, Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly chased Lightning forward Yanni Gourde into the Toronto zone during a Tampa Bay penalty kill. Referee Brad Meier skated back with them. On the audio carried by Sportsnet in Canada, there's a clear anti-gay slur shouted by someone near ice level. The NHL is in the process of finding out who uttered it.
Tyler Johnson and Cedric Paquette each scored two goals, and the NHL-leading Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-2 on Monday night.
The Leafs issued their own statement from general manager Kyle Dubas after the investigation was announced: ""The club is aware of the reports surrounding a homophobic slur used during the Maple Leafs versus Lightning game on Monday night. The issue of homophobia is one the Toronto Maple Leaf Hockey Club strongly condemns and takes very seriously. We are in communication with the NHL and are cooperating fully with their office.""
The Maple Leafs have been one of the most vocal supporters of the You Can Play organization, which partnered with the team on Feb. 25 for a night that spotlighted the LGBTQ hockey community. A public service announcement featuring Maple Leafs players was shown in-arena during the game. ""The Toronto Maple Leafs are very much a part of You Can Play history,"" said Ryan Pettengill, You Can Play executive director.
The league has punished players before for using anti-gay slurs during games. Andrew Shaw, then with the Chicago Blackhawks, was suspended for one playoff game in 2017 after using an anti-gay slur while seated in the penalty box. But later that postseason, the NHL came under fire for handing Anaheim Ducks center Ryan Getzlaf only a $10,000 fine for what many felt was an anti-gay slur he used in the Western Conference finals.

26167165,"This week, we're going to focus on how the Islanders could improve their lineup, and what the Western Conference elite have to play for in the final weeks of the regular season. Data referenced in this piece is courtesy of Natural Stat Trick, and is up to date through the conclusion of Wednesday night's games.
There's something weird brewing on the Island right now. A team playing it safe with their young players and giving minutes to their veterans ahead of them instead is nothing new in the NHL, but watching the Islanders stubbornly keep Josh Ho-Sang and Michael Dal Colle buried in the AHL until recently, despite a growing mountain of evidence that they shouldn't be there, gets stranger with each passing day.
There's so many layers to this story, none of which makes the decision-making process any more defensible from the team's perspective. Part of what makes it so confounding is who the Islanders currently are giving regular minutes to instead of Dal Colle and Ho-Sang. The combination of Leo Komarov and Valtteri Filppula has been absolutely caved in this season when playing together -- except for when they've played with one of Dal Colle or Ho-Sang:
The Islanders have been a hot topic in hockey circles because of their fluctuating underlying numbers as the season has gone along. While there's certainly merit to being skeptical about a team that relies as heavily on their goaltending as they have, the sneaky truth is that their shot metrics actually skyrocketed into a very respectable neighborhood in the middle months once players like Ho-Sang, Dal Colle, and Devon Toews were called up and given a real look.
That's what makes this entire ordeal especially mystifying. Dal Colle and Ho-Sang are not only their AHL affiliate's leading scorers on a per-game basis this season, but they've actually passed the NHL test with flying colors whenever they've gotten a chance. While they're imperfect players in their own right, the positive effect that the things they do well has had on their teammates is obvious. From a lineup construction perspective, the danger of having a unit that's constantly hemmed in its own zone the way Komarov and Filppula are without them is an understated one. There's a cumulative snowball effect there, where everyone else is now fighting an uphill battle because they're starting their own shift chasing the puck and having to defend. That's why it's no surprise that the team's underlying numbers as a collective have once again cratered, which should serve as a blaring siren for those paying attention.
An updated look at the players poised for future NHL stardom, led by Colorado defenseman prospect Cale Makar, currently skating for UMass.
Who has the best playoff chances? What teams are poised to land Jack Hughes with the No. 1 pick? Projections for both, plus the most important games today.
Some teams are eyeing the playoffs. Others, not so much. But there's hope for the future for all of them. Plus, our updated league-wide ranks.
With Ho-Sang, at least it's somewhat understandable that the way he plays clashes stylistically with what Barry Trotz and Lou Lamoriello want from this group. While it's flawed logic, you can see how his tendency to hold on to the puck and seek out higher-danger opportunities as opposed to making the safe play would fly in the face of the conservative, low-event game plan the Islanders have turned into a science this season. Even though his type of skill and creativity is what this group so desperately craves, it's also almost wasted in this particular environment.
The Dal Colle part of this equation however is utterly bizarre, because he actually profiles as a perfect fit on this particular Islanders team. While he will likely never produce the kind of offense to justify the Isles taking him with the No. 5 overall pick in 2014, that also doesn't preclude him from turning into a valuable contributor in other ways.
In his limited time in the league he's already shown himself to be a ferocious forechecker, using his unique combination of size and speed in a functional manner to create turnovers and make life miserable for opposing defenders trying to cleanly exit their own zone. Even though that type of skill set is traditionally considered to be best suited in a bottom-six grinding role, it actually makes an awful lot of sense to pair it alongside a talent like Mathew Barzal.
Similar to the vast success that Zach Hyman has found doing the dirty work next to Mitch Marner, having someone that can create a couple of extra possessions for your most skilled player to work with -- akin to an offensive rebounder or particularly effective pick-setter in basketball -- is an intriguing proposition that could certainly pay dividends over the long haul. Barzal and Dal Colle have spent only 63 five-on-five minutes together thus far, but we've already seen what could be between the two of them: In that span, the Islanders have controlled a whopping 55.0 percent of the shot attempts, 57.7 percent of the shots on goal, and 62.6 percent of the high-danger attempts.
Regardless of how both Dal Colle and Ho-Sang are ultimately deployed in the lineup, there's no argument based in reality that the Islanders as currently constructed have 12 better forward options than the two of them. While it was understandable that they didn't want to spend premium future assets to add to their roster at the deadline, it's genuinely mystifying to watch them refuse to improve their lineup when better internal options are available right under their nose.
For those looking for worthwhile storylines in this brief lull between the trade deadline and the start of the Stanley Cup playoffs, there are a couple of rather fascinating playoff races brewing at the moment. Given the mismatch between the number of wild-card spots available and the teams in legitimate contention for them, someone in each conference is inevitably going to just miss the cut in heartbreaking fashion in the final days.
Even though it doesn't necessarily have the same immediate do-or-die stakes as those contests, the race that may very well wind up having the most important big picture ramifications is the one taking place atop the Pacific Division, as the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks jockey for divisional supremacy.
The 2019 NHL draft is June 21-22 in Vancouver. Get ready with the latest prospect rankings and our mock draft.

While I'll happily join the chorus pointing out the faults in the current playoff format, this is one instance where the seeding structure will actually accomplish its designed goal. The 82-game marathon of a regular season is an absolute grind, forcing far too many games into the schedule given the physically taxing nature of the sport. If the league is going to continue prioritizing financial benefits over the long-term health of its players by having them play so many games, it needs to stack the deck to properly incentivize winning in the regular season.
We're getting that this season in the Pacific, where it's almost impossible to overstate the importance of winning the division for the two teams involved. The difference in playoff road maps for the team that finishes first versus the one that gets the second seed is massive. Aside from the two Eastern wild cards jockeying to stay out of Tampa Bay's path in the opening round, it's about as large a discrepancy in quality of competition as you'll see in a league that prides itself on its parity. Here are the two options in this choose your own adventure:
Door No. 1: The team that wins the Pacific will likely take home the top seed in the West overall, which means that they'll secure home-ice advantage all the way through their half of the bracket. Most importantly, they'll get to play whoever finishes the season as the second wild card. It's still far too early to know who that'll be, but it looks like it'll be one of Dallas, Minnesota, Colorado or Arizona. While all of those potential options bring some sort of matchup problem to the table, they're all also deeply flawed teams that can be exploited in a seven-game series.
Assuming the division champs are able get through that series with relative ease, they'll be well-positioned to take on a travelling team that's bruised and battered after escaping the other Pacific division matchup. Which brings us to...
Door No. 2: The team that falls short gets the second seed will have to take on the Vegas Golden Knights in the opening round. While they'll still have home-ice advantage in the series, it represents a brutal draw.
While we don't want to infer too much from a five-game sample against mostly lowly competition, the Knights have looked like a juggernaut in their first spin around the league after adding Mark Stone at the deadline. They've won all five of those games since the deadline by a combined 17-7 margin, controlling a league high 61.2 percent of the shot attempts and 59.5 percent of the shots on goal at 5-on-5. Five games in isolation doesn't mean much, but it's a useful addendum to the overall story of the Knights' season. They've been humming as a group since long before the trade, sitting comfortably as a top-three possession team this season.
Adding a player of Stone's caliber without subtracting anything from the main roster is massive, now giving Vegas a devastating 1-2 punch of forward lines that can match up against whatever any of the other top teams in the league throw at them. Stone has not only immediately jelled alongside Paul Stastny and Max Pacioretty; the three of them have absolutely stifled the opposition since being put together:
As great as Stone is himself, his presence has an equally important trickle-down effect on the lineup. He allows Gerard Gallant and his staff to bump Alex Tuch down to the third line, giving it a much-needed shot in the arm by finally providing Cody Eakin with a legitimate running mate. It also frees up the trio of Jonathan Marchessault, William Karlsson and Reilly Smith to face some lighter competition and not have to shoulder as much of the scoring load as they had to in the past.
This week's episode features two teams on the up-swing. First, Blues forward Ryan O'Reilly talks about the remarkable turnaround in St. Louis this season (12:20). Linda Cohn of adds her thoughts on the Blues, and Jordan ""Winnington"" (23:57). Plus, how was Greg'strip to Long Island for John Tavares' return (29:16)? Then, we catch up with Vegas defenseman Shea Theadore, who talks about Year Two for the Golden Knights franchise (37:45). Listen »
The Knights are a problem, and the Sharks and Flames will do everything in their power to stay away from them for as long as they can. While they're surely aware of that already, it'll be interesting to see how much they prioritize that over everything else, and the lengths they're willing to go.
For example, Calgary really can't afford to be giving away free points by starting Mike Smith routinely down the stretch, but they also presumably don't want to put too many miles on David Rittich, either. He's already shown a bit of wear in his performance of late, and as he goes north of 40 appearances for the season, it's worth keeping in mind that he's only played 24, 41, 30, 48, 32 and 33 games per season since turning pro in 2012. They'd be wise to keep him as fresh as possible, seeing as how important he will be for any potential extended playoff run they make.
In terms of schedule, the Sharks have a couple more home dates than the Flames, but it evens out because Calgary gets to face more lottery-bound competition. Considering how tight things are, it's quite possible that the looming March 31 meeting between the two in San Jose could wind up being the ultimate difference maker.
For the teams involved, these final weeks will be tense despite the fact that they've long since effectively cinched up their playoff berths. Regardless of how things shake out, we're assured an absolute heavyweight tilt between the No. 2 seed and Vegas that's overqualified to be a first-round matchup.
