25873070,"On Monday, Panarin's agent Daniel Milstein put out a statement: ""We have informed the team that we are willing to discuss Artemi's future after the season. Our priority now is to focus on the rest of the season, trying to win a Stanley Cup for the CBJ & their fans. No additional comments will be made.""
Panarin is in the final year of a two-year contract, earning $6 million this season. Coming off an 82-point season and putting up 53 points in 46 games this season has the 27-year-old in line for a big raise.
Panarin has said that he is not ready to commit to Columbus at this time. But he hasn't requested a trade either.
The cap-strapped Chicago Blackhawks traded Panarin to the Blue Jackets for Brandon Saad in June 2017 because they knew the Calder Trophy winner would command a contract that they might not be able to afford.
The Blue Jackets are now in a tough spot. Goalie Sergei Bobrovsky is also a pending free agent. A trade of one or both of the stars could make sense before they possibly walk, but the Blue Jackets are currently in third place in the Metropolitan Division, only four points out of first.
"
25877544,"Progress reports are always stressful, but ultimately, they serve as equal parts validation and motivation. So we decided to hand out report cards to all 31 teams as they head down the stretch of the season to the trade deadline. Stats are collected from sites like Corsica, Natural Stat Trick and Hockey Reference.
It's time to separate the honor roll from those headed for detention.
Note: Read through all 31 teams, or click below to skip ahead to your favorite:

Preseason over/under: 102.5
Current points pace: 98
Forwards: B+
Whether or not you believe the line of Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand and David Pastrnak is the best line in the NHL, they are the heartbeat of this Bruins team, accounting for 63 of the Bruins' 145 goals as a team. David Krejci has had a fine season as the anchor of a second scoring line, usually with Jake DeBrusk, with 40 points. Sean Kuraly has played well enough to have made Riley Nash a distant memory. But they're going to need some more from their bottom six to overcome the deep contenders in the East, and they're going to need that elusive top-six winger at the deadline to really get the Stanley Cup parade rolling.
Defense: B+
About what you'd expect. Torey Krug has 33 points in 39 games, with 21 of them on the power play. Zdeno Chara is still doing Zdeno Chara things, and his pairing with Charlie McAvoy (when healthy) is solid. Brandon Carlo is good support for Krug, and the Kevan Miller and Matt Grzelcyk pairing isn't bad for what it is.
Goalies: A-
Tuukka Rask worked through some issues this season to find his form, posting a .919 save percentage and an 8.33 goals saved above average. The Bruins have gotten eerily identical numbers from Jaroslav Halak. One of the best tandems in the NHL.
Special teams: B
The Bruins have a lethal power play, second in the NHL at 27.3 percent. Their penalty kill is middling at 16th in the league (80.3 percent). Marchand and Bergeron play on both.
Coach: B+
Bruce Cassidy has the benefit of having a few constants anchoring his lineup as he tries dozens of combinations around them to see what works. But he has done well to keep the ship running during some frustrating injuries.
GM: B+
Don Sweeney had some nice summer additions that have worked well, including Halak and defenseman John Moore. He swung and missed on Rick Nash during the last trade deadline, but one assumes he's going to get another pitch this deadline with guys like Wayne Simmonds and Artemi Panarin potentially on the move.
Class president: David Pastrnak
Pastrnak has taken things to another level this season, with 28 goals in 50 games.
In danger of failing: David Backes
Backes has five goals in 41 games, skating 13:40 per game. He makes $6 million annually through 2022 and was a healthy scratch for the first time in his career this season.

Overall team grade: B+
A very solid foundation for a championship team that still feels like it's a big piece or two away from really making that push.
Preseason over/under: 80.5
Current points pace: 92
Forwards: B
Sometimes as hockey fans, we should all take a step back and ask what we did to deserve such joys as watching Jack Eichel (16-37-53) and Jeff Skinner (31-14-45) coexist on the same line. Whether it's with Sam Reinhart or Jason Pominville, that line has dominated to the tune of a plus-19 in goal differential. And then ... a bit of a drop-off. The duo of Conor Sheary and Casey Mittelstadt has been together for much of the season, with the latter player starting to find his game after a horror show December (two points in 13 games). Kyle Okposo is a veteran hand on different lines, while Evan Rodrigues and Tage Thompson are starting to contribute. Zemgus Girgensons and Johan Larsson have been a decent duo, while Vladimir Sobotka can still win a faceoff.
Defense: C+
Rasmus Dahlin has been overshadowed in the rookie race by Elias Pettersson, which is a shame, because the first overall pick has been strong -- the Sabres have an on-ice save percentage of .937 when he's out there. Zach Bogosian has been a strong partner for him. Rasmus Ristolainen has 31 points and defensive deficiencies. The rest of the blue line has had its struggles.
Goalies: B+
Carter Hutton (.911) and Linus Ullmark (.914) have similar numbers across the board, with Ullmark just a shade better in fewer games (19, to Hutton's 31). It's a little amazing that the Sabres solidified their goaltending position by jettisoning Robin Lehner, who might now be a Vezina Trophy candidate for the Islanders. What a world.
Special teams: B
The Sabres are 22nd in the NHL at 16.8 percent on the power play. Their penalty kill is a bit better at 81.8 percent, good for ninth.
Coach: C+
Phil Housley's front-runner status for the Jack Adams seems years ago, rather than months. He has moved pieces around to try to find the right fit. The Sabres are very much in the hunt, but some of their underlying numbers leave something to be desired.
GM: B+
Jason Botterill brought on Skinner, Hutton and Sheary. He also watched as Patrik Berglund, a key part of the Ryan O'Reilly trade, took his puck and went home.
Class president: Jeff Skinner
Who knew all Jeff Skinner needed was an All-Star center to threaten 50 goals in a contract year?
In danger of failing: Marco Scandella
Scandella was acquired as a puck-moving offensive defenseman. He has nine points in 40 games this season and has been getting rolled at 5-on-5 in shot attempts.

Overall team grade: B
The Sabres aren't that team winning 10 in a row, and they're not that team that lost the next five games after they did. They're a team blessed with a dominant top line that is clearly still building toward contention. Just being in a playoff race will do wonders for Eichel and Dahlin.
Preseason over/under: 75.5
Current points pace: 72
Forwards: B
Dylan Larkin has 48 points in 51 games, working well with Gustav Nyquist (32 assists) and a variety of wingers that has included Tyler Bertuzzi (28 points) and old standby Justin Abdelkader (five goals in 51 games). Andreas Athanasiou is finally putting his blazing speed to good use with his best offensive season, scoring 17 goals and adding 13 assists in 45 games, although his line has been outpossessed 5-on-5. Anthony Mantha is just a tick down from his previous two seasons but has been strong. Old hands Frans Nielsen and Thomas Vanek do what they do, while 19-year-old top prospect Michael Rasmussen has contributed with 13 points in 41 games.
Defense: C+
The Red Wings have tried several combinations of defensemen: Nicklas Jensen, Niklas Kronwall, Danny DeKeyser, Mike Green, Filip Hronek, Jonathan Ericsson, rookie Dennis Cholowski and the currently injured Trevor Daley. Some of these combinations were the result of injuries, while others were out of ineffectiveness. Of the group, Jensen was featured most prominently on the combinations that produced the best results. This is not a coincidence.
Goalies: B+
We are all witnesses to the Jimmy Howard renaissance. The 34-year-old career Wing has a .916 save percentage and a quality starts percentage of .636 in 34 games. He earned his trip to the All-Star Game. Jonathan Bernier was brought in to tandem with Howard, but his .892 save percentage in 20 games wasn't what Detroit bargained for.
Special teams: D+
Detroit has the 25th-best power play in the NHL at 16.2 percent. They have the 23rd-best penalty kill at 77.6 percent. Their special teams are ... not special.
Coach: C+
The success obviously hasn't been there for Jeff Blashill, who will spend what many assume will be his last season in Detroit out of the playoffs again. But the Red Wings play hard, and he has done well in developing some of their young talents.
GM: C
Ken Holland made a bold draft pick in Filip Zadina, who has looked promising in Grand Rapids. He made a strong trade last season when he sent Tomas Tatar to the Golden Knights at the deadline. He has other assets to move this season -- although some of them have trade protection, because, well, it's Ken Holland. Then, we'll all wait to see if he moves on to other opportunities.
Class president: Nicklas Jensen
As mentioned, Jensen has been one of the most underrated players in the NHL this season, posting an expected goals plus/minus of plus-1.79 playing with a variety of defense partners. Will the Red Wings keep him around?
In danger of failing: Luke Glendening
Glendening has 17 points on the season. He also has a minus-156 in shot attempts and a minus-8.13 in expected goals. Woof.

Overall team grade: C
Not as bad as their record, but not good either. But boy, that Jimmy Howard has been good.
Preseason over/under: 94.5
Current points pace: 82
Forwards: B
The Panthers are 15th this season with 152 goals, and over half of them have come from five forwards. Mike Hoffman (23 goals) is on the best goal-scoring pace of his career. Evgenii Dadonov (18) and Aleksander Barkov (17) have been a reliable duo. Frank Vatrano has been a revelation, with 16 goals in 47 games, both career highs. Jonathan Huberdeau leads the team with 49 points in 48 games, with 12 of them coming on goals. (Vincent Trocheck, an offensive dynamo, has 18 points in 21 games due to injury. Nick Bjugstad was limited to 32 games.) Now the bad news: The Panthers are having a rough defensive year, and that includes the forwards, where even the reliable Barkov is a minus-7 in goal differential. And the rest of the forward group has been underwhelming.
Defense: C+
If Keith Yandle and Aaron Ekblad could play the entire game, the Panthers would be fine. They've been great this season, with Ekblad notching 21 points and Yandle tallying 31 with an even goal differential. Mackenzie Weegar and Bogdan Kiselevich have been surprisingly effective, while Mark Pysyk and Mike Matheson have been subpar. Like the forwards, it's a top-heavy group.
Goalies: D
Through 48 games, the Panthers don't have a goalie with a save percentage greater than .900. Roberto Luongo (.896), James Reimer (.897) and Michael Hutchinson (.839) have by far been the team's weakest group. Luongo, 39, is having arguably the worst season in his storied NHL career, with a goals saved above average of minus-8.01.
Special teams: B+
The Panthers have an outstanding power play, third in the league at 26.8 percent. They have a middling penalty kill at 80.6 percent, good for 14th.
Coach: C-
Bob Boughner obviously can't play goal himself, or else he might have tried it by now. The Panthers are 11th in shot attempts but 20th in percentage of scoring chances at 5-on-5. If Florida misses the playoff cut again, Boughner should hire a private eye to keep tabs on Joel Quenneville's whereabouts.
GM: B
Dale Tallon managed to launder Mike Hoffman through San Jose, which has worked out nicely. He also got Edmonton to overpay for Alex Petrovic, which was also addition by subtraction. There's a strong foundation here. Tallon just needs to figure out how to tie it all together, which honestly is an annual struggle.
Class president: Frank Vatrano
Vatrano went from being a low-key deadline pickup last season to someone who might post more goals this season than he has in his career to date.
In danger of failing: Roberto Luongo
We all want Roberto Luongo to win. We all want Roberto Luongo to be a part of this league as long as possible. But this season has been injury-plagued and deleterious to the Panthers, and he turns 40 in April.

Overall team grade: C-
The Panthers have shown some life lately, but it's probably too late to rally for a playoff spot. One of the NHL's biggest disappointments this season.
Preseason over/under: 80.5
Current points pace: 98
Forwards: A-
The Canadiens have gone from 29th in the NHL last season in goals to 14th in 2018-19, and their improved forward group has been a major factor in that. Max Domi (44 points), Tomas Tatar (38 points), Joel Armia (12 points) and rookie Jesperi Kotkaniemi (23 points) all arrived in the offseason. Phillip Danault (33 points) has taken a leap in production, while holdovers like Jonathan Drouin (37 points), Artturi Lehkonen (23 points) and the always delightful Brendan Gallagher (30 points) and Andrew Shaw (24 points) have all been strong this season.
Defense: B
Shea Weber has been fantastic since returning from injury, with 16 points in 27 games and transforming Victor Mete into his new Ryan Suter. Jeff Petry has been paired with both Mike Reilly and Jordie Benn, and neither combo really took off. Brett Kulak has been in the mix, too.
Goalies: B+
Carey Price has a goals saved above average of plus-8.52 this season, which is being celebrated as a return to form for the former Vezina winner. He has a .915 save percentage and a .541 quality-starts percentage in 37 starts. Antti Niemi has been a less-than-stellar backup.
Special teams: C-
It's a good thing Montreal is so dominant at 5-on-5 because its power play is 30th in the NHL (13 percent) and the penalty kill is 19th overall at 79.5 percent.
Coach: A-
Claude Julien probably hasn't gotten the love he deserves yet for this Montreal turnaround -- that's what happens when Barry Trotz sucks all the air out of the room -- but he's working the lines well and has this team playing a tenacious style that has paid off offensively and defensively at even strength. Last season the Canadiens were 13th in percentage of scoring chances at 5-on-5; this season, they're fifth.
GM: B+
Look, to paraphrase Black Widow from ""The Avengers,"" Marc Bergevin has red on his ledger. There are many mistakes he has made and many mistakes that have yet to come to light. (Let's revisit that Carey Price contract in a few years.) But right now, this season, you have to give the man credit for the additions he made up front, which are paying dividends.
Class president: Max Domi
Domi is like a transfer student from Arizona who arrives on the first day of class and ends up valedictorian. His pace has slowed a bit, but 44 points in 51 games is beyond anyone's expectation for him.
In danger of failing: Matthew Peca, Charles Hudon
Neither Peca nor Hudon has managed to surpass each other in competition for a forward spot this season, in the sense that both have been overwhelmed at 5-on-5. In 29 games, Peca has a minus-9.49 in relative Corsi.

Overall team grade: A-
The Canadiens are not out of the woods yet, with the Eastern Conference bubble still featuring the Sabres and Hurricanes trying to pick someone off. But with 61 points in 51 games, the Canadiens look like a playoff team.
Preseason over/under: 69.5
Current points pace: 71
Forwards: B
Mark Stone has 50 points in 50 games. Matt Duchene has 47 points in 41 games. That's the good news. The bad news is that they're both pending free agents, and their contract status could mean their time in Ottawa could be at an end. But what a season they've had so far. Ditto Ryan Dzingel, who is in the last year of his deal and has 20 goals. Beyond these three players, who have played together, it has been a mixed bag for Ottawa. There have been solid contributions from Chris Tierney (32 points), Mikkel Boedker (27 points), Zack Smith (19 points in 41 games) and Bobby Ryan (30 points in 47 games). There has been promise from young players like Colin White (26 points) and Brady Tkachuk (23 points). Also, Magnus Paajarvi was on the team.
Defense: C+
Thomas Chabot has been a revelation this season, with 39 points in 42 games. He has primarily played with Dylan DeMelo in an effective duo (plus-10 goal differential). Less effective? Almost every other pairing. Mark Borowiecki, Maxime Lajoie, Christian Jaros, Ben Harpur and Christian Wolanin have all seen time.
Goalies: C-
The Senators have used five different goalies this season, including Craig Anderson (.906, 3.55) and Anders Nilsson (.931, 2.14 in seven games). Their .898 team save percentage is actually No. 22 in the NHL, but the Senators have the worst goals-against average (3.74).
Special teams: D+
Ottawa is 15th on the power play, at 20.3 percent, and 29th on the penalty kill, at 75.5 percent.
Coach: C-
For a minute earlier this season, it appeared that Guy Boucher would have this Ottawa team defiantly contending in the Eastern Conference. That minute passed officially around the Senators' eight-game losing streak from Dec. 21 through Jan. 9.
GM: C+
Say what you will about Pierre Dorion, but he found a defensive partner for Chabot and a forward who has averaged 17:35 per game from the Erik Karlsson trade, along with a draft-pick bounty. Does that excuse the fact that Colorado owns what might be the first pick overall in the draft from Ottawa, having traded it for Matt Duchene, who might not even re-sign with the Senators? Um, no.
Class president: Mark Stone
Stone is having a tremendous offensive season to go along with (finally) some Selke Trophy buzz in a contract year.
In danger of failing: Cody Ceci
In danger? With yet another possession-disaster season (minus-290 shot attempts, minus-20 in 5-on-5 goal differential), Ceci is repeating the grade at this point.

Overall team grade: D
The Senators are who we thought they were: a bad hockey team with a few outstanding veteran players and some hope for the future. Well, save for that lottery pick they no longer own ...
Preseason over/under: 107.5
Current points pace: 125
Forwards: A
The deepest collection of forwards in the NHL. Nikita Kucherov is chasing an MVP and a scoring title, with 78 points in 49 games. Brayden Point is chasing a massive new contract, with 65 points in 49 games and the growing reputation as the NHL's next great two-way center. Steven Stamkos (57 points in 49 games) is chasing his first Cup. Tyler Johnson, Ondrej Palat, Yanni Gourde, J.T. Miller, Alex Killorn, Anthony Cirelli, Cedric Paquette, what's left of Ryan Callahan ... what an assemblage of talent.
Defense: A-
This defenseman corps might just match the forwards for quality depth. Victor Hedman has entered his ""perennially contending for the Norris Trophy"" phase of his career. The Bolts have had him with (much maligned) veteran Dan Girardi. Ryan McDonagh has cooled off since a Norris-caliber start, but he has contributed at both ends. Mikhail Sergachev and Braydon Coburn are first and second in shot-attempt plus/minus for the Lightning, while Anton Stralman can play with anyone. Erik Cernak has been used as well.
Goalies: A-
Andrei Vasilevskiy had a .925 save percentage through his first 28 games, which meant a 15.47 goals saved above average. He's a legit Vezina contender. While Louis Domingue can't replace him as a Stanley Cup-caliber goalie, should some injury befall Vasilevskiy, he filled in admirably during the starter's absence in the regular season.
Special teams: A
The Lightning have the NHL's top power play (29.5 percent) and fifth-best penalty kill (83.5 percent).
Coach: A
Jon Cooper had the Lightning on a historic points pace for most of the season and has juggled this roster's many parts expertly. The Jack Adams usually goes to the guy who turns around a bad team rather than the guy who captains the fastest ship in the fleet, but you expect Cooper would be a finalist at this point.
GM: INC
Julien BriseBois took over from Steve Yzerman in September, and in fairness, we're not going to judge the guy for the Slater Koekkoek-for-Jan Rutta trade. But suffice it to say, he helped Yzerman build this roster (and did so with perennial cap acrobatics).
Class president: Brayden Point
Point needed 82 games to score 32 goals and 66 points last season. He scored 30 goals and recorded 65 points in his first 49 games this season. A massive breakout year for the 22-year-old center.
In danger of failing: Anton Stralman
Stralman isn't anywhere close to flunking, but we should note that he's the only player on the current roster for the Lightning that's in negative expected goal differential territory (-1.96 through 31 games in an injury-plagued season).

Overall team grade: A
The best team in the NHL this season through the first 50 games.
Preseason over/under: 106.5
Current points pace: 104
Forwards: A-
The addition of John Tavares (54 points in 49 games) to Mitch Marner's life has been gigantic, as the Leafs winger leads the team with 62 points. Tavares has 30 goals on the season, with a chance to pass his career best of 38. So that's one line. The other line features Auston Matthews (1.23 points per game) and William Nylander, the latter of whom is still trying to find his game after his contract negotiation went deep into the season. So that's two lines. Then there's Nazem Kadri (32 points), who has skated with Patrick Marleau (22 points) this season. Kasperi Kapanen, Andreas Johnsson, Zach Hyman, Connor Brown ... it all adds up to a talented group that Mike Babcock has deployed in waves this season.
Defense: B
So what happens with Morgan Rielly (50 points) now? Does the Norris contender play with the recently acquired Jake Muzzin, whose presence bumps the Leafs up a notch in the report card? Does Ron Hainsey slip down the lineup to where Travis Dermott and Igor Ozhiganov reside? Toronto fan pariah Jake Gardiner and Nikita Zaitsev are the other combination. Muzzin helps, but this group needs another impact player to be at a championship level.
Goalies: A-
Frederik Andersen (.923) has been an incredible last line of defense for the Leafs, with a .676 quality starts percentage and a plus-16.51 goals saved above average. Garret Sparks (.907) is 6-3-1 as a backup.
Special teams: B+
The Leafs are ninth on the power play (22.1 percent) and 12th on the penalty kill (81.1 percent). Could be better; could be worse.
Coach: A-
Babcock has the Leafs playing a strong possession game (ninth in shot-attempt percentage) that helps power a dynamic offense (3.55 goals per game). But the test isn't in the regular season. It's in Babcock winning a playoff round for the first time since Nicklas Lidstrom retired.
GM: A-
Bed sheets or not, Kyle Dubas successfully sold Tavares on coming to the Leafs, got Nylander on the contract he was comfortable with and made a potentially strong trade for Muzzin. There are still further steps in this plan, but it's coming together.
Class president: Mitch Marner
At this rate, Marner is going to pass his career high in points before Valentine's Day. It's going to be a very, very interesting contract tango with Marner and Matthews and Dubas.
In danger of failing: Ron Hainsey
Hainsey is the Leafs' worst player for shot-attempt differential and has a relative expected goals for percentage of minus-5.77.
Overall team grade: A-
The Leafs have an overpowering offense when it's clicking, a goalie who can win them games by himself and a defense that they hope can handle the other beasts of the East. For now, they're just short of an A.

Preseason over/under: 85.5
Current points pace: 89
Forwards: C
Another team carried exclusively by their top line. The Canes have endured some anemic stretches, which might cost them a playoff spot. Acquiring scoring help is an extreme necessity.
Defense: A-
Carolina might have the deepest blue line in the NHL, full stop. They'll likely auction a defenseman off in a trade, for scoring help, though let's laud these guys for allowing the fewest shots per game in the league.
Goalies: C
The Scott Darling situation is unfortunate. Carolina thought it might have a decent backup option in Petr Mrazek, but they lucked out on waivers with Curtis McElhinney, who has put up gratifying performances and a .914 save percentage.
Special teams: C-
Another year of a drab power play (it ranks 23rd in the league). At least there are signs of hope that it can be fixed; in one four-game stretch earlier this month, the Canes scored five power-play goals.
Coach: B
Dealing with limited resources, rookie head coach Rod Brind'Amour has churned a lot out of this group. They're having fun and buying into his up-tempo style. But they still don't look like a playoff team.
GM: B-
There have been some shrewd moves: the Calvin De Haan offseason acquisition, grabbing McElhinney on waivers and the trade to land Nino Niederreiter. There have also been some misses. We hope this team won't be stunted by frugality.
Class president: Sebastian Aho
The third-year forward began the season with a 12-game point streak and never let up; Aho is now at 57 points in 50 games. He is the team's most consistent and exciting forward.
In danger of failing: Scott Darling
It's an unfortunate situation, but there's a chance we'll never see Darling realize his full potential as an NHL starter.

Overall team grade: C+
They're having fun, they're still rocking great Corsi figures and ... they're still not in the playoff picture. There's a lot of potential here, but Carolina isn't quite ready to level up.
Preseason over/under: 97.5
Current points pace: 99
Forwards: B+
The Blue Jackets have blossomed as a top-10 scoring team, and it's not just the Artemi Panarin show. The entire first line has been sensational, with Cam Atkinson (28 goals) and Pierre Luc Dubois (18) pulling weight. The second line is tough to play against, but production trails after that.
Defense: A-
The Blue Jackets are getting production from their defensemen, who control shot share and push the pace of play. The blueliners have been crucial, with the team getting less-than-expected production in net.
Goalies: B
As Sergei Bobrovsky enters contract uncertainty, it hasn't been his best season; he has allowed three or more goals on 20 occasions, sandwiched by some signature strong play. Joonas Korpisalo has emerged as a proficient No. 2.
Special teams: B-
The power play is once again a burden (ranking 27th in the league at the break), but at least the team is addressing it, hiring Martin St. Louis as a consultant. Columbus has a top-10 penalty kill.
Coach: A
John Tortorella gets an A solely for this: The team's two most talented players are mired in dramatic contract situations, something that could derail a locker room. And yet, it hasn't felt like a distraction at all. Kudos to a veteran coach for keeping the group on message.
GM: B-
Jarmo Kekalainen made a good bet on Anthony Duclair and a whiff (so far) on Riley Nash. How he ultimately handles Bobrovsky and Panarin -- the most pressing decisions for any GM this year -- will be the ultimate basis for judgment.
Class president: Cam Atkinson
On pace for 48 goals and 85 points -- which would shatter his previous career bests of 35 goals and 62 points, set in 2016-17 -- Atkinson's offensive surge eases a bit of the anxiety over potentially losing Panarin at the trade deadline.
In danger of failing: Riley Nash
He was the Blue Jackets' only big free-agent acquisition (signed to a three-year, $8.25 million deal to shore up center depth) and hasn't matched the expectations, recording just six points while averaging 10:30 of ice time per game and potentially having a career-worst season in the faceoff circle (43.2 percent).

Overall team grade: B+
It's been a season beset by uncertainty behind the scenes, given the looming free agency of Panarin and Bobrovsky, and yet the Blue Jackets have played distraction-free hockey. Depending on how the trade deadline shakes out, could this be the year they finally win a playoff series?
Preseason over/under: 91.5
Current points pace: 75
Forwards: C+
Taylor Hall's prolonged absence leaves a unit that needs playmakers. Six players have double-digit goal totals, which is promising.
Defense: D+
This defense lacks two things: depth and dominant players. That means the Devils are often playing catch-up; they've allowed the fifth-most goals in the league at 3.37 per game.
Goalies: D+
Rookie MacKenzie Blackwood has shined of late, which helps forgive what the Devils got out of the position at the beginning of the season, which was dreadful. Keith Kinkaid crashed back to Earth, while we might have seen the last of Cory Schneider.
Special teams: B+
If there's a silver lining to this Devils' season, it's the penalty kill, which has been consistently excellent. New Jersey has the second-best mark in the league at 87.4 The power play ranks 18th.
Coach: C+
Coming off the finest season in his career, it's hard to fault John Hynes too much for New Jersey's current state. He wants his team to play more physical; let's see how his team responds.
GM: C+
Rob Shero did nothing to address his defense in the offseason, and the results show. Of course, Shero is in for the long play, and he likely predicted this regression, therefore he isn't giving his team every resource -- just yet.
Class president: Kyle Palmieri
He filled in for Taylor Hall at All-Star Weekend, which was emblematic of his role for the Devils this season. In the absence of the reigning MVP, the 27-year-old Palmieri is carrying the load, on pace for a career-high 39 goals.
In danger of failing: Cory Schneider
The 32-year-old Schneider is on the books for $6 million over the next three seasons, which leaves the Devils in a predicament. He's slow, allows goals in bunches and looks like he might not ever fully recover from hip surgery.

Overall team grade: D
We knew the team would likely take a step back from last season's revelation, but not quite like this. Plagued by poor goaltending and a lack of playmakers, the Devils are biding their time in the rebuild.
Preseason over/under: 82.5
Current points pace: 105
Forwards: B+
The Islanders are able to roll out four lines, independent of matchups. New York has been able to get balanced production, though there are weak spots -- the third line, particularly, has had a few rough patches.
Defense: A
The Islanders were last in goals against at 3.57 per game last season and hit the All-Star break in first this season, at 2.41. Credit is due to goaltending, but also to a refocused bunch led by a healthy Johnny Boychuk and top partner Nick Leddy. Others have stepped up, too; Scott Mayfield and Devon Toews have been delights.
Goalies: A
After detailing past battles with alcoholism and bipolar disorder, the new scenery and structure has worked wonders for Robin Lehner, who at $1.5 million is the league's 46th-highest-paid goaltender. At the break, he led the league in save percentage (.931) with a stingy 2.02 GAA. Thomas Greiss has played terrific as well.
Special teams: D
The Islanders' 5-on-5 numbers are spectacular. Conversely, the power play (ranking 24th at the break) and penalty kill (22nd) are not.
Coach: A
Barry Trotz won the midseason Coach of the Year Award, as voted by the Pro Hockey Writers Association. What he has been able to do with this team -- motivating a buy-in post-John Tavares, creating a defensive structure -- is nothing short of extraordinary.
GM: A-
We were skeptical of Lou Lamoriello this summer. After losing Tavares, it appeared the strategy was to sign every fourth-line forward available. Some of of the patchwork fixes have worked. The goaltending acquisitions have been huge. Signing Trotz was a grand slam.
Class president: Robin Lehner
Lehner's renaissance is the league's most compelling comeback story. His resurgence aligns perfectly with the Islanders' resurgence.
In danger of failing: The power play
The man-advantage unit has been a momentum killer at times. Perhaps a trade-deadline acquisition -- the Islanders could be in on any of the top forwards available -- could add a jolt and reward this group for its strong start.

Overall team grade: A
The Islanders are the most impressive first-half team in the league. There was no pity after losing the franchise center. The once-porous defense and goaltending suddenly are strengths.
Preseason over/under: 75.5
Current points pace: 82
Forwards: C
Mika Zibanejad, Kevin Hayes and Chris Kreider are thriving under new coach David Quinn. Most everyone else is underperforming, with high-profile youngsters -- namely Pavel Buchnevich, Filip Chytil and Lias Andersson, who has been shuttling to the AHL -- taking longer to fit in.
Defense: C-
This eight-man rotation just isn't working. It's a blend of bloated contracts (Kevin Shattenkirk, Marc Staal), streakiness (Brady Skjei) and youngsters who are raw. New York has allowed the sixth-most goals in the league at 5-on-5, and fourth-most shots per game.
Goalies: B
Henrik Lundqvist's win in the Save Streak competition at All-Star weekend was perfectly emblematic of his current role with the Rangers: down to the last chance, still capable of brilliance, ultimately it's inconsequential.
Special teams: C-
The power play hovers around the league average -- Zibanejad has been particularly lethal here, with 16 power-play points -- but the penalty kill ranked 26th entering the All-Star break.
Coach: C+
Taking the job at the cusp of the rebuild? That's no easy task. Quinn is trying to motivate via benchings and is teaching by holding more intensive practices than his predecessor. The results should come eventually, but it's definitely going to be a process.
GM: B-
The letter to fans came out about a year ago outlining the rebuild, and to this point, management has stayed true to the plan. Full marks for that. Even bigger marks if they can recoup value at the deadline.
Class president: Mika Zibanejad
Among veterans, he might be the Rangers' only untouchable forward at the deadline, or at least he should be. The 25-year-old center will likely smash his previous career high of 51 points. As of the break, he was on pace for 75.
In danger of failing: Mats Zuccarello
For most of the first half, the Norwegian fan favorite was mired in a terrible slump. The impending UFA is a good bet to be gone by the trade deadline, and unfortunately, his value is quite low.

Overall team grade: C-
Rebuild commence. The first month was a red herring, and there will be difficult months ahead. As long as the team sticks to the plan, though, this season will be remembered as the roughest in the transition.
Preseason over/under: 97.5
Current points pace: 79
Forwards: C-
The Flyers are 22nd in the league, averaging just 2.82 goals per game. The big free-agent acquisition James van Riemsdyk took a while to get going, while other players the Flyers are depending on -- Nolan Patrick and Jakub Voracek -- have been frustrating.
Defense: C
The team's two most talented defensemen, Shayne Gostisbehere and Ivan Provorov, are having off seasons. There have been bright spots, though. See: Radko Gudas, Robert Hagg. Philadelphia has allowed 3.4 goals per game, fourth-most in the league, but goaltending is partially to blame.
Goalies: D
Hextall was preaching patience, but it's evident Hart is ready to be a star ... now. His recent emergence masks what was becoming a hysterical game of musical chairs for Flyers goalies. The collective struggles nearly cost the team the season.
Special teams: F
The Flyers have the worst power play in the league. They're at risk of finishing below 12.2 percent, which is the franchise-worst mark (set in 1967-68). Philadelphia has the fourth-least-efficient penalty kill in the league.
Coach: INC
Dave Hakstol's message was getting stale with the players, so he got the cut. Now it appears Scott Gordon is giving a jolt, but it's too early to tell if it's sustainable.
GM: INC
Chuck Fletcher inherited a roster in peril. He has threatened seismic moves -- everyone is available, it seems, besides Claude Giroux and Carter Hart -- and he'll be closely scrutinized at the deadline.
Class president: Carter Hart
The numbers are impressive: a .922 save percentage through his first 13 starts. Yes, it's a small sample size, but Hart has given fans a reason to believe and the team something to rally around. He's not a franchise-saver, but it feels like saving this season.
In danger of failing: Every goalie not named Carter Hart
The Flyers have already tied the NHL record for cycling through seven goaltenders in a season. The six used before Hart arrived ranged from unlucky to inept.

Overall team grade: D
The team had high hopes, but expectations spiraled quickly. Coach Hakstol and GM Ron Hextall became quick casualties as new GM Fletcher is forced to salvage the roster.
Preseason over/under: 102.5
Current points pace: 98
Forwards: B+
The Pens score a ton (3.49 goals per game, fifth in the league). No, Evgeni Malkin doesn't look like himself, but he's still at higher than a point-per-game pace. The Pens would like better production from their bottom six, but what team wouldn't?
Defense: B-
The Penguins have managed shorthanded (without Justin Schultz) thanks to Kris Letang's bounce-back season and Marcus Pettersson, who has charmed since being acquired from the Ducks. The team is allowing too many shots, though, nearly 33 per game.
Goalies: B
Matt Murray had concerning play to start the season, but since returning from injury in mid-December he is 10-1-0 with a .944 save percentage. Casey DeSmith is developing quite nicely and has the numbers (.917 save percentage through 28 games) to prove it.
Special teams: A-
Once again, the power play has the ability to be lethal, and the Pens rank sixth in the league (24.8 percent). The penalty kill also ranks sixth in the league (83.3 percent).
Coach: A-
Mike Sullivan is a coach who is constantly making adjustments, and that helped pull the Penguins out of a poor start into a scorching hot December. It doesn't feel like Pittsburgh has hit its full potential just yet.
GM: A-
Jim Rutherford is a GM who is never satisfied. He probably overpaid for Jack Johnson in free agency, but his midseason adjustments -- specifically, swapping Daniel Sprong for Pettersson -- have turned out to be just what the team needed. Does he have another move up his sleeve before the deadline?
Class president: Kris Letang
He hasn't been flawless. But the fact that the team's No. 1 defenseman has returned to form has been pivotal, as he's averaging 26-plus minutes per game, his second-best career average.
In danger of failing: Derick Brassard
Not the best way to go into free agency. Brassard was so coveted as a No. 3 center heading into last season's trade deadline, and he now finds himself expendable and likely to be traded.

Overall team grade: B
It has been a streaky four months for Sidney Crosby & Co. -- from goaltending to winning and losing in bunches -- but the Penguins still lurk in good playoff position and look to hit their stride at the right time.
Preseason over/under: 97.5
Current points pace: 98
Forwards: B
Alex Ovechkin is on another ridiculous tear, and the Capitals can score in bunches; plus, they have the league's fourth-best shooting percentage (11.2). But that's masking some depth issues. Evgeny Kuznetsov, Lars Eller and the third line are underperforming.
Defense: B-
The Caps have had to weather injuries to Christian Djoos and Brooks Orpik, as well as a few lapses by other regulars. Overall, though, it's very similar to last year's group; the promotion of Todd Reirden (who was previously in charge of defense as an assistant) has allowed for stability.
Goalies: B+
Braden Holtby was selected to his fourth-straight All-Star Game and has been solid enough, although we know he is capable of more. New backup Pheonix Copley, meanwhile, has been one of the best surprises, with 10 wins in his first 15 appearances.
Special teams: C
The power play began the season hot (20-for-67 in the first 21 games) but slumped from Dec. 15 on (6-for-52) and now ranks 10th in the league at 21.8 percent. The penalty kill, which ranks 25th, has allowed multiple power-play goals on 10 different occasions.
Coach: B
As a rookie head coach, Reirden has been as even keel as they come. With a veteran roster, there isn't too much space for coaching, although he'll be tested to pull the team out of the midseason funk.
GM: B+
There's not a lot of reason to criticize Brian McClellan. After rightfully keeping the band (mostly) together, he has been able to find depth replacements for defense (Jonas Siegenthaler) and goaltending (Copley) from within.
Class president: Alex Ovechkin
It feels like this team goes as their captain goes, and my, oh my, has the 33-year-old been hot. Ovechkin has more than double the number of goals of any other Capital.
In danger of failing: Andre Burakovsky
In the final campaign of a two-year bridge contract, Burakovsky has not been able to consistently produce as the Caps imagined. He's a trendy name on the trade market and could benefit from a change of scenery.
Overall team grade: B
What's worse than a hangover? A delayed hangover. The Capitals looked like they could fend it off with familiar early-season play but entered a tailspin before the break. Hopefully a week off gets them back on track.

Preseason over/under: 85.5
Current points pace: 72
Forwards: B
This is a class divided. The marquee stars are soaring. Patrick Kane is on pace for a career-high 114 points. Jonathan Toews shrugged off any rust from last season and is on pace for a career-high 35 goals. Alex DeBrincat is the next sure thing. And then ... there's everyone else. Depth is a serious concern.
Defense: D
Have there been some bright spots? Sure. Henri Jokiharju has been a delight, and Erik Gustafsson is an offensive revelation. But Brent Seabrook can still be a liability and -- despite a few corrective moves to clear bad signings -- this feels like a group in transition, waiting for the young prospects to fill in next season.
Goalies: D+
The Blackhawks warmly welcomed back Corey Crawford, but the 34-year-old sustained his second concussion in under a year, and it's unclear when he will return. Cam Ward is a genial guy who can still kick it at age 34, but his $3 million signing is an overpay considering the production (.888 save percentage). Plucky 24-year-old Collin Delia is waiting in the wings.
Special teams: C+
The Blackhawks have the league's worst penalty kill at 74.1 percent. For most of the season, their power play has been just as putrid. They must have enlisted extra tutoring sessions after the coaching change, because since Dec. 23, Chicago actually has the best power play in the league (17-for-41, 41.5 percent).
Coach: INC
He's not the grizzled Hall of Famer he replaced, but Jeremy Colliton is no substitute teacher, either. Having recently turned 34, he has the full vote of confidence from management. We've seen encouraging flashes, but also some stagnant play. We probably won't get our full sense of Colliton as a coach until his first full NHL season.
GM: B-
If we were grading Bowman in the offseason, he'd get a D. But he has been busy this season doing something few GMs do: admitting mistakes. Erasing the Jan Rutta (regrettable) and Brandon Manning (even more regrettable) signings was strong work. Buying in on Dylan Strome is panning out already. Firing Joel Quenneville was bold, but the common theme here is Bowman acting with conviction, a powerful trait.
Class president: Patrick Kane
Despite the Blackhawks' turmoil over the past two seasons, the star winger has been the constant. He's not linemate-dependent; he's producing at a spectacular rate. Unfortunately, it's all going to waste.
In danger of failing: Chris Kunitz
Bowman's Band-Aid signings in the summer weren't terribly inspiring, and unfortunately, Kunitz encapsulates that theme. The 35-year-old has had a forgettable tenure in Chicago and isn't going anywhere given his no-move clause.

Overall team grade: D
We didn't expect much from the Blackhawks after last season's regression. Chicago is wading through an organizational transition, and an early coaching change meant the team had to take a further step back before it could move forward.
Preseason over/under: 89.5
Current points pace: 85
Forwards: B-
First line? Those guys get an A-plus. Higher than an A-plus, if possible. Nathan MacKinnon, Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen have accounted for nearly 50 percent of the team's goals. But besides some bright spots, like 33-year-old renaissance man Carl Soderberg, everyone else gets a D.
Defense: C
The defense, which has allowed a ninth-worst 3.22 goals per game, still looks like a work in progress and is prone to serious defensive lapses. They also have a puzzling 1-7 record in overtime.
Goalies: D+
Semyon Varlamov has shown flashes but can't sustain it. Meanwhile, Philipp Grubauer (who many figured would win the starting job eventually) has looked uncomfortable with his new team and doesn't look as good as he did in Washington, albeit in limited appearances.
Special teams: B-
The power play is dynamite (thanks, largely -- you guessed it -- to PP1 and that top trio). The penalty kill is fifth-worst in the league; it doesn't help that the Avalanche have taken the most penalties (206 entering the All-Star break).
Coach: C+
Jared Bednar has been insistent on keeping the top line together, for better or worse. He got into a public shouting match with his star player, MacKinnon, over when to pull the goalie, though both downplayed the incident. It's not easy for Bednar, considering what he has to work with. His true test will be if he can pull this team out of a slide for a playoff return.
GM: B
Joe Sakic didn't do much to this roster this season, preaching patience. The discipline is admirable, but at some point, a shakeup -- even something small -- might be exactly what this team needs to level up.
Class president: Nathan MacKinnon
The No. 1 center is building yet another MVP case. But more than that, MacKinnon is the soul of this team. As he goes, so do the Avs.
In danger of failing: The goaltenders
Look, it's not totally dire. But the uninspired play of Varlamov and Grubbauer, especially of late, could have the Avalanche tumbling out of the playoff picture for good.

Overall team grade: B-
Let's keep things in context. This team is still ahead of schedule. But a warm start has cooled off significantly. An uninspiring supporting cast could cost this team a playoff spot.
Preseason over/under: 94.5
Current points pace: 89
Forwards: C
This should be a fast, high-octane attack, freed from the structured reins of Ken Hitchcock. Instead, this is a lackluster group that can't get it going in the first period (a league-low 23 goals in that frame through 49 games) and ranks 29th in the league in goals per game.
Defense: B
The Stars have been without Stephen Johns for the entire season, and now it appears Marc Methot is done for the season. The rotating cast of blueliners has been something to behold. And yet, defense hasn't been a disaster. Thank the overachievers, like Miro Heiskanen and Taylor Fedun.
Goalies: A
Both Ben Bishop and Anton Khudobin have been stabilizers for this team. Among goalies with at least 20 appearances, Bishop quietly led the Western Conference into the All-Star break with a .921 save percentage.
Special teams: A-
The power play is just OK, but the penalty kill is actually quite good. In fact, the PK -- which ranks seventh in the league -- might be Dallas' top asset, besides goaltending.
Coach: B-
Look, drama and injuries aside, this team is in playoff position. That's a minor miracle considering the highest-paid players are underperforming (though not as badly as the team CEO made it out to be) and the fact that players are adjusting to a completely new scheme yet again. Jim Montgomery told the Dallas Morning News that he lost his way a bit in December, but he seems to have settled in since then.
GM: C-
The Stars whiffed on their big free-agent targets. The Valeri Nichushkin signing was a bust. There have been a few minor tweaks since then, but nothing too inspiring yet. Over the second half of the season, could Jim Nill be fighting for his job?
Class president: Miro Heiskanen
In an otherwise forgettable first half (at least a first half the Stars would like to forget) we'll remember the play of the 19-year-old rookie as exceptional. The Stars were bullish about drafting the Finn at No. 3 in 2017 -- ahead of Elias Pettersson -- and you can understand the justification.
In danger of failing: Valeri Nichushkin
The Stars lured their 2013 first-round pick (No. 10 overall) back from the KHL with a two-year, $5.9 million deal. Nichushkin was supposed to add a scoring punch on the second line. He has yet to record a goal in 37 games. It has been a bust so far.

Overall team grade: B-
The Stars have been a blob of inconsistency, and off-ice drama could have derailed the season. And yet, they're in playoff position. That's a sure sign of resiliency, though there is plenty of room for improvements.
Preseason over/under: 95.5
Current points pace: 90
Forwards: B-
The Wild rank 24th in the league in goals per game. Jason Zucker and Eric Staal have crashed back to Earth, and the first line hasn't been consistent, but the return of a healthy Zach Parise has been crucial. Charlie Coyle is showing slight improvements from his slump, despite toying with positions.
Defense: A-
Losing Matt Dumba in December hurt, but Minnesota's depth has come through, even as GM Paul Fenton picks up some bottom-pair candidates from waivers (guys he's familiar with from his Nashville days). The Wild are among the league's stingiest in terms of shots allowed per game (29.2).
Goalies: B+
Devan Dubnyk is putting together a fine season, especially turning it on of late. The Wild's lone All-Star has a .913 save percentage and a 2.57 GAA -- figures that are improving. Expect him to get a heavy workload down the stretch. Alex Stalock isn't the most dependable backup.
Special teams: A-
The penalty kill ranks third in the league (84.2 percent). Minnesota misses Dumba on the power play (he had 12 power-play points, 6 goals and 6 assists in his first 32 games) but has maintained in his absence, hitting at 20.9 percent, which is above league average.
Coach: B+
Putting together a successful regular season is old hat for veteran Bruce Boudreau. Getting this team over the playoff hump is the real challenge.
GM: B-
Paul Fenton did virtually nothing to the roster he inherited for the first six months on the job. You can't fault that; the team is playoff-ready. Trading Nino Niederreiter was inevitable, and the return (at first glance) was questionable. We have a feeling he has more on the way.
Class president: Zach Parise
Parise has rebounded quite nicely, playing in his first full season since the October 2017 back surgery. In fact, the 34-year-old is arguably playing his best hockey since he was a New Jersey Devil a decade ago.
In danger of failing: Eric Staal
Hey, we didn't expect Staal to set a franchise record for goals. We knew the 42 goals last season were the by-product of a perfect storm: right player, right situation, right time. But his regression -- in his overall play -- is not what he wants entering unrestricted free agency, through which he hopes to cash in and stay with his current club.

Overall team grade: B-
With nearly the same roster as last season, the Wild are about where we expected them to be: sometimes streaky, but poised for a playoff run.
Preseason over/under: 105.5
Current points pace: 101
Forwards: B-
The Preds haven't had a fully healthy roster for long, which makes it hard to judge. But we agree with this assessment from GM David Poile, appearing on ESPN 102.5 The Game last week: ""Our first line, we're very confident that that's one of the best lines in the league. But we're not as confident in our second line, and that's because [Kyle] Turris has been out a couple of times this year, and there's been some inconsistencies with some of the other players. I feel confident on the third and fourth lines, whatever we put together.""
Defense: A-
Nashville boasts one of the most talented defensive corps in the league. Despite P.K. Subban missing 19 games, this group has shown the ability to play a structured game and shut out other top units when they need to. Entering the All-Star break, they've allowed only 87 goals at 5-on-5, the fourth-best mark in the league.
Goalies: A-
Pekka Rinne, unsurprisingly, looks terrific. Fresh off of signing a two-year extension, his .883 high-danger save percentage is second among all goalies with at least 1,000 minutes entering the All-Star break. Backup Juuse Saros has struggled at times, but there's no reason to fret about the 23-year-old just yet.
Special teams: D
The power play has been brutal, ranking 30th in the league at the break (13.14 percent); even though the Predators have been without key pieces, we're not grading on a curve. The penalty kill is just OK, ranking 16th in the league.
Coach: A-
That the Predators still hover atop the Central Division, wading through a litany of injuries and suspension, is not just a testament to roster construction, but coaching as well. Peter Laviolette has had to juggle lines more than he has liked.
GM: B+
Poile is in maintenance mode now. He has essentially the same roster from last season and has only had to manage call-ups due to injuries. Poile probably made the right decision waiving Anthony Bitetto, who was dispensable as an eighth defenseman. The real test comes at the trade deadline.
Class president: Ryan Johansen
The first line can compete with the best in the NHL when all three linemates are together, and so far this season, Johnasen has been the only constant (thanks to health). The No. 1 center is on pace to match his career high in points (71) and smash his previous high for assists (56).
In danger of failing: Kevin Fiala
His underlying numbers are OK, but the production has not been there for the 22-year-old winger for whom management and fans have high hopes (just seven goals and 21 assists at 5-on-5 in 52 games). Could the impending RFA be dangled in a trade?

Overall team grade: A-
The Predators have weathered a bevy of injuries to big-time players and still find themselves near the top of the Central. They might not win the Presidents' Trophy again this season, but once healthy, they should rack up the wins.
Preseason over/under: 96.5
Current points pace: 82
Forwards: C+
Jaden Schwartz, Brayden Schenn, Alexander Steen and Vladimir Tarasenko are all producing at lower levels than last season, with Schenn especially taking a step back. Newcomer Ryan O'Reilly has delivered for sure, but the early-season malaise especially affected the forward corps.
Defense: C-
The team's best defenseman, Alex Pietrangelo, doesn't look like himself, with more defensive lapses than usual. That sets the tone for the rest of the group, which has been middling, at best.
Goalies: C+
Jordan Binnington was the No. 4 goaltender at camp and emerged as one of the team's true delights. The 25-year-old is keeping the group -- which sent Chad Johnson to waivers and has Jake Allen playing like Jake Allen -- afloat.
Special teams: B-
The power play is serviceable, hitting at just below 20 percent. The penalty kill has looked terrific at times, and at other times has been quite leaky.
Coach: INC
Since Craig Berube took over, the Blues continued their struggles, then began heating up. Overall, their record with Berube is just above .500. GM Doug Armstrong gave him the nod for the rest of the season.
GM: C-
Ryan O'Reilly? Absolute home run addition. David Perron has performed, too. But the rest of the construction feels shaky, and if Armstrong keeps it status quo, the Blues will be just that: a team left yearning for more come spring time.
Class president: Ryan O'Reilly
Not only does O'Reilly, the big summer acquisition, lead the Blues in goals, but he has 15 more points than the next closest St. Louis player. He's a leader setting the tone. He just needs everyone else to follow.
In danger of failing: Doug Armstrong
Armstrong is a GM in crisis. He has threatened to make seismic moves before, but hasn't followed through, and now he has a roster that only shows up on some nights. It's noteworthy his name has already begun to circulate for other GM openings, like Edmonton or Seattle, meaning others in the league don't figure him to stay in this role very long.

Overall team grade: C-
It was a catastrophic start for St. Louis, a team with hefty Cup aspirations. Coach Mike Yeo was the early fall man. The Blues have shaped up since then, but we fear the cuts are already too deep.
Preseason over/under: 106.5
Current points pace: 108
Forwards: A-
The second line has had its woes; things might have turned out differently if Paul Stastny stayed instead of choosing Vegas. As long as the team is committed to keeping Blake Wheeler and Mark Scheifele together, the top line will be among the league's elite.
Defense: B-
Dustin Byfuglien was beginning to put together a Norris Trophy campaign before his lower-body injury on Dec. 29 (he has not played since). The Jets are giving up more quality scoring chances (and goals) than they did last season.
Goalies: B
It has been a step back for Connor Hellebuyck, a breakout star of the 2017-18 season. It has been a giant leap ahead for Laurent Brossoit, a relatively unknown free-agent signing who emerged as one of the league's best backups.
Special teams: B+
The power play can look dynamite at times (and ranks fourth in the league overall), though it had a pedestrian go from Jan. 1 until the All-Star break, hitting on just 17.2 percent of opportunities. The penalty kill appears decent enough.
GM: A-
The Jets' Cup window is wide open. Some of the best players are still on entry-level contracts, the backup goalie turned out to be a diamond in the rough, Scheifele's contract has been exposed as the league's biggest bargain and Wheeler is affordable too -- until his cap hit increases by nearly $3 million next season. Securing a second-line center remains a goal, but overall, this has been solid roster management from Kevin Cheveldayoff & Co.
Coach: B+
Paul Maurice still has to figure out how to get the second line clicking, but he might get some help after the trade deadline. His biggest challenge is getting the offense to strike like it did in December, without sacrificing defensive structure.
Class president: Mark Scheifele
Scheifele plays hard in all situations (and more than a minute more per game than any other Winnipeg forward) and is on pace for more than 100 points. What more could you want from your No. 1 center?
In danger of failing: Jack Roslovic
The 21-year-old is finally getting an expanded role -- he's averaging nearly 14 minutes per game since Jan. 6 -- but he's still not producing, with only two goals on the season and none since Dec. 2.
Overall team grade: A
The Jets entered the season with weighty expectations thanks to last season's results. And they don't seem fazed by any of it. What's more, it feels like they haven't even hit full stride yet.

Preseason over/under: 94.5
Current points pace: 82
Forwards: D
A mushy soufflé of injuries, disappointments and underwhelming returns, the Ducks' forward corps has exactly two players whose points-per-game average is higher this season than in the entirety of last season: Ondrej Kase, who appeared in 30 games before a torn labrum ended his season, and Nick Ritchie, who didn't come to terms on a new contract until Oct. 17. Corey Perry has missed the season. Ryan Getzlaf is the only player with more than 30 points through 51 games. Their younger players weren't ready for prime time.
Defense: C+
Not nearly as disappointing as the forwards, but a mixed bag. Hampus Lindholm and Brandon Montour have been solid, both on the positive side of goals-for percentage at 5-on-5. Cam Fowler (limited to 28 games) and Josh Manson have had down years. Not a single defenseman is positive in possession metrics at 5-on-5 with more than 20 games played, and the Ducks surrender 34.1 shots per game. Which is why ...
Goalies: A
John Gibson's back might finally be breaking after carrying the Ducks for months. But he still has a .619 quality starts percentage and 15.40 goals saved above average in 43 games.
Special teams: C
The Ducks' power play is ranked No. 28 (14.5 percent), and their penalty kill is ranked No. 13 (80.7). That's down from last season, but for Anaheim, what isn't?
Coach: C-
The Ducks have some of the least impressive numbers in the NHL this season, measured by either traditional or advanced stats. Yet while other coaches have been kicked off a cliff by middling teams, GM Bob Murray has stayed loyal to his friend, coach Randy Carlyle.
GM: B-
Murray's grade is bolstered by some shrewd signings -- Kase at $2.6 million with RFA status is just great -- but otherwise he has been moving the deck chairs and protecting a coach who probably has earned a pink slip.
Class president: John Gibson
He has contributed over nine points to the Ducks' total on his own. He's an MVP candidate for most of the season for dragging what's left of the Ducks to playoff contention.
In danger of failing: Josh Manson
What on earth happened here? A minus-152 in shot attempts and a minus-8.08 in expected goals in 5-on-5 over 46 games. He started 2019 with zero points in 10 games. All of these are way off his career averages.

Overall team grade: C
Honestly, we'd love to grade this Ducks team harsher, but the fact remains that in the wacky West, they're still on the wild-card bubble. Gibson carries them to an average mark.

Sigh. It wouldn't be the Coyotes if we weren't talking about what might have been, either due to injury (free-agent signing Michael Grabner, trade pickup Nick Schmaltz and promising Christian Dvorak) or underwhelming results (whither Derek Stepan?). Alex Galchenyuk is actually on the same pace he was with Montreal last season; it's just tough to laud that when Max Domi has 44 points in 51 games for the Habs.
Defense: B-
More injury fun, as Kevin Connauton and Jakob Chychrun missed time and Jason Demers could miss the season. But Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Niklas Hjalmarsson have been fantastic this season. Hjalmarsson has a 52.25 scoring-chances-for percentage, best on the team. He's a rock defensively, as evidenced by starting just 34 percent of his shifts in the offensive zone, and the kind of defensive defenseman any team would covet (like, say, Chicago ... ouch).
Goalies: B+
This almost seems like it should be an incomplete considering that, yet again, an injury to Antti Raanta dramatically altered the Coyotes' season. But Darcy Kuemper (5.07 goals saved above average) has been strong, and Adin Hill has had his moments. Bottom line: The Coyotes are ninth in goals-against average, with 2.82.
Special teams: B+
The Coyotes have the 19th-best power play (18.2 percent) and the best penalty kill (86.9 percent) in the NHL.
Coach: B
Do we blame Rick Tocchet for a team with an 8.5 shooting percentage? We'd rather praise him for keeping the Coyotes in playoff contention despite all of these injuries and an 8.5 shooting percentage.
GM: C+
John Chayka is always going to be cut some slack because of the Coyotes' challenges: monetarily, and that lingering arena mystery. There is also a lot to praise in his moves, including getting Ekman-Larsson locked in an eight-year extension, and a lot to excuse due to injuries. But at some point, the general manager's grade has to reflect his team's ability to make the playoffs, which they haven't since 2012.
Class president: Clayton Keller
Keller leads the team with 35 points in 50 games, a lone offensive high spot for a team that ranks 28th in goals scored this season.
In danger of failing: Josh Archibald
Archibald is a depth forward. He's also a team-worst minus-114 in shot attempts at 5-on-5 and a minus-4.49 in expected goals plus/minus. But he has had other things on his mind.

Overall team grade: B-
Despite all of these offensive deficiencies and massive injuries, the Coyotes remain very much in the wild-card race.
Preseason over/under: 93.5
Current points pace: 114
Forwards: A
Johnny Gaudreau is making a strong bid for the Hart Trophy, with 73 points in his first 51 games, good for a 1.43 points-per-game average. But he's one of four Calgary forwards with better than a point-per-game average: Sean Monahan (1.20), Elias Lindholm (1.14) and Matthew Tkachuk (1.12) are the others. The Flames have contributors throughout their lineup, but the top line and that partnership between Tkachuk and Mikael Backlund are something special.
Defense: A-
Could they use some help on their bottom pairing? Sure. But the top pairings of Mark Giordano and T.J. Brodie, as well as Noah Hanifin and Travis Hamonic, are among the best in the NHL. Giordano and Brodie have a plus-14 goal differential.
Goalies: B+
""Big Save"" David Rittich saved the Flames' season. He has a quality starts percentage of .704 in 30 games, with a stellar 8.29 goals saved above average. Mike Smith, in contrast, has a goals saved above average of minus-12.40. Yikes.
Special teams: B
The Flames are eighth on the power play, with a 23.6 percent conversion rate. They're 21st on the penalty kill, with a 79.0 percent rate.
Coach: A-
While Bill Peters has been the beneficiary of some great goaltending from Rittich, he has also sprinkled something on this roster to make it the second-best offensive team in hockey, with a 3.73 goals-for average.
GM: A-
Outside of one misstep (see below), Brad Treliving has constructed a team with championship potential. Peters has been a great fit as coach. He found Rittich. The Dougie Hamilton trade has, in the short term, worked well for Calgary, with Elias Lindholm fitting about as perfectly onto this team as Treliving could have imagined. Best of all? He has so many major pieces on this team locked in through 2022.
Class president: Mark Giordano
Giordano is the current favorite for the Norris Trophy. He's second in points (52 in 41 games) and playing outstanding defense, to the tune of a plus-168 in shot attempts. It's time he graduated into the upper tier of NHL defensemen, because he has been building that case for years.
In danger of failing: James Neal
With five goals in 49 games and a contract that runs through 2023, Neal remains one of the biggest free-agent flops of the past year.

Overall team grade: A
The Flames' journey to the top of the Pacific Division might be unexpected, but it's completely legitimate ... as long as Rittich doesn't turn into a pumpkin. Their offense is good enough that they can hang with anyone.
Preseason over/under: 89.5
Current points pace: 80
Forwards: C
Like everything else in Edmonton he's trying to drag to success by himself, Connor McDavid raises this grade from the failure chasm. His 73 points in 49 games put him on pace for a career-best 1.49 points per game. Leon Draisaitl has 61 points in 50 games, which is outstanding; the caveat being that he has not become the Malkin to McDavid's Crosby, as his metrics take a noticeable dip without McDavid on his line. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins has 46 points in 50 games and is finally getting the recognition for his 200-foot game in that ""Hey, maybe don't trade this great young forward, too"" kind of way. But outside of Alex Chiasson's remarkable 17 goals, there are more busts than booms up front. Milan Lucic is still getting $6 million per season for 12 points (thus far). Jesse Puljujarvi is still gestating into a consistent NHL player.
Defense: D
Injuries have played a role here, as the Oilers miss Andrej Sekera's competence and really missed Oscar Klefbom's everything during a recent spiral in the standings. The metrics aren't kind to the Oilers who have played this season: While Darnell Nurse has 24 points in 50 games, his expected goals plus/minus at 5-on-5 is a brutal minus-10.44, for example. Adam Larsson has been ordinary, recently fired GM Peter Chiarelli's scrambling acquisitions have underwhelmed and it remains one of the great mysteries of life how Edmonton shipped out so many assets in the past three years without securing a single top-tier, puck-moving defenseman.
Goalies: C-
Mikko Koskinen has been adequate at best, with a .910 save percentage, and in Edmonton, ""adequate"" gets you a contract extension. Cam Talbot declined for a second straight season, down to a .894 save percentage in 27 games. Overall, this might be the first documented instance of Ken Hitchcock being unable to inflate the numbers of the goalies on a team he's trying to rescue.
Special teams: C+
The Oilers are 11th on the power play at 21.1 percent and 24th on the kill at 77.3 percent. McDavid ranks ninth in power-play points with 23 in 49 games.
Coach: INC
We can't in good faith give a letter grade to either Todd McLellan (9-10-1) or Ken Hitchcock (14-14-2) given their bodies of work, so we'll just say that the former wasn't nearly as bad as indicated and the latter is cooking the best meal he can with the few gourmet ingredients he has in the cupboard.
GM: F
We do, however, have enough of a body of work this season to flunk Chiarelli, who was a rare in-season general manager firing for the Oilers. Even putting aside the slapdash and archaic manner in which he constructed this team, his moves during the season were like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic as it rested at the bottom of the ocean off Newfoundland. And no partial credit for Hitchcock agreeing to work with his old Team Canada cronies.
Class president: Connor McDavid
It's getting to the point where we need to call Seal Team 6 to extract McDavid from this franchise. Failing that, maybe the Oilers steal a wild-card spot so McDavid can win the Hart Trophy.
In danger of failing: Tobias Rieder
Rieder was brought on to bring speedy offense and to kill penalties. He hasn't scored a goal in 36 games, and the penalty kill hasn't exactly been bolstered by the presence of this pending RFA. Another Chiarelli classic.

Overall team grade: C-
Again, it's hard to really throw the Oilers into detention when there's still a chance they can make the playoffs. It just feels like they're a smoldering dumpster fire of mismanagement that has surrounded the best player in the world with mediocrity.
Preseason over/under: 92.5
Current points pace: 72
Forwards: D
What a difference a year makes. Anze Kopitar went from his best offensive season to his worst (0.69 points per game). Jeff Carter, Tyler Toffoli and Adrian Kempe have all underwhelmed, while Dustin Brown and Alex Iafallo at least hit their marks in point production. Ilya Kovalchuk has 22 points in 40 games but has arguably been their worst forward defensively. The Kings' 2.26 goals per game is the worst in the NHL.
Defense: C
The Kings' woeful season even dragged the reliable Drew Doughty down, as he's posting the worst possession numbers of his career thanks mostly to Derek Forbort's bad season. Alec Martinez and the since-traded Jake Muzzin had a steady pairing. Dion Phaneuf has a minus-13 in goal differential in 43 games.
Goalies: C+
It hasn't gotten the spotlight, but the Kings' goaltending has been the best thing about a bad team. Jonathan Quick was limited to 24 games due to injury and has mustered a .904 save percentage with a .542 quality start percentage on a last-place team. Jack Campbell had a .931 save percentage in his 17 games. Even rookie Cal Petersen had a strong run in December.
Special teams: D
The Kings have the 26th-worst power play (15.3) and the 30th-worst penalty kill (74.3) in the league.
Coach: D+
John Stevens got a raw deal, getting fired after 13 games in a panicky move by the Kings. Interim coach Willie Desjardins wasn't able to squeeze much out of this group and has made some baffling decisions during what should be his lone season behind the Kings bench.
GM: C-
Rob Blake fired Stevens too early and helped build a team that's clearly out of sync with where the NHL is in 2019. But the return for Jake Muzzin was strong, and there's still a chance to bring this grade up higher with a few more deadline deals like that.
Class president: Alex Iafallo
Iafallo is one of the few Kings to improve offensively year-over-year and has been the best player on the ice many times this season -- which is good, as he's 25 and it's nice for this team to have some hope for the future.
In danger of failing: Tyler Toffoli
What happened to Tyler Toffoli? He's on track for his worst goal and point production season. He's an unrestricted free agent in 2020, and one wonders if he hasn't played himself out of the Kings' plans.

Overall team grade: F
The worst team in the NHL this season and, without much debate, the most disappointing.
Preseason over/under: 101.5
Current points pace: 103
Forwards: A-
The emergence of Timo Meier, who leads the Sharks in primary points per 60 minutes (at 5-on-5), has bolstered what was already a potent group. Joe Pavelski (27 goals), Tomas Hertl (22), Evander Kane (21) and Logan Couture (19) have all had strong offensive campaigns. Joonas Donskoi has chipped in. And Joe Thornton keeps chugging along, with 25 points in 43 games. The Sharks go three lines deep and aren't overly reliant on any combination to carry them.
Defense: B+
When you look at their average ice times, there's a chance that Brent Burns and/or Erik Karlsson will be on the ice for the Sharks for over three-quarters of the game, which is an advantage few teams enjoy. Burns leads the team with 55 points. Karlsson has been Karlsson since a first-month adjustment period. But the defense's grade gets dragged down a bit by the inexplicable dud season for Marc-Edouard Vlasic, whose pairing with Justin Braun yielded some stunningly bad results until Vlasic's injury in early January. One wonders if a Vlasic/Karlsson duo is what's best for the Sharks (which would pair Braun with Brenden Dillon).
Goalies: C-
Not great, Bob. Martin Jones (.895) and Aaron Dell (.891) have both been underwhelming, with Jones sporting an elephantine minus-13.75 goals saved above average -- by far the Achilles heel of this otherwise championship-caliber group.
Special teams: B+
The Sharks have the No. 9 power play in the NHL at a 24.7 percent conversion rate, as one might expect with Burns and Karlsson back there. They're 10th on the penalty kill (81.3 percent).
Coach: A-
Peter DeBoer's team is blessed with star talent, but he has also shown he knows how to juggle this roster and manage a veteran team.
GM: A-
Doug Wilson has put nearly all the pieces in place for a run at the Stanley Cup. And then the Sharks can worry about the fallout from some of these bold moves, including the future of Erik Karlsson.
Class president: Joe Pavelski
Pavelski is on the best goal-scoring pace of his career, with 27 in 52 games. And hey, would you look at that, his contract is up this summer. What a coincidence.
In danger of failing: Martin Jones
His numbers have fallen off a cliff while the rest of the team around him has improved. He had a nice stretch of games in January before giving up 17 in three games.

Overall team grade: A-
The Sharks are keeping pace with the Flames for the lead in the Pacific Division. This grade would be bumped up if the goaltending was where it should have been this season.
Preseason over/under: 77.5
Current points pace: 84
Forwards: B+
The arrival of Elias Pettersson was a game-changer in every way for Vancouver: a top scorer, a top-six center and a player who can anchor a second scoring line in support of the reliable fireworks of Brock Boeser and Bo Horvat. The rest of the lineup has had players who have chipped in (Jake Virtanen, Nikolay Goldobin, Loui Eriksson and Antoine Roussel) here and there. Bottom line: a tough group to play against, with one absolute star player.
Defense: B
Chris Tanev and Alexander Edler have been a stabilizing force for an inconsistent group, and by that we mean Ben Hutton and Erik Gudbranson have a minus-18 goal differential and a minus-155 in shot attempts together. Derrick Pouliot and Troy Stecher have played above expectations at times.
Goalies: C+
Jacob Markstrom is giving the Canucks about what they expect from him, which is a .622 quality-starts percentage and 10-game stretches in which he's exceptional. Anders Nilsson didn't really work out as a backup. It'll be interesting to see how much action goalie of the future Thatcher Demko gets down the stretch, as that'll really affect their final grade.
Special teams: C
The Canucks' special teams have been in the bottom third of the league, with a power play at No. 21 (16.8) and a penalty kill at No. 20 (79.2).
Coach: A-
Travis Green has made the Canucks the kind of team opponents hate to play against.
GM: B+
Jim Benning continues to make small moves that matter, whether it's bringing in a veteran like Roussel or rescuing Josh Leivo or collecting future assets in sell-offs. It'll be interesting to see what happens with Edler, a pending UFA.
Class president: Elias Pettersson
Pettersson is averaging 3.02 primary points per 60 minutes at 5-on-5, which is just extraordinary. He basically won the Calder Trophy by November.
In danger of failing: Erik Gudbranson
I'll never quite understand how Gudbranson, an underwhelming defender and a perennial black hole for possession, got a three-year extension last February, but here we are.

Overall team grade: B
Pettersson has shifted the trajectory of this franchise in a post-Sedin twins world, and the vibe he has brought to the roster has lifted the Canucks into their role as an unexpected wild-card contender -- warts and all.
Preseason over/under: 101.5
Current points pace: 98
Forwards: B+
The magic of the Jonathan Marchessault (35 points) line last season has faded to the point where he, Reilly Smith (27 points) and William Karlsson (32 points, with 16 goals) have been moved around the lineup a bit. (Their line has been together for over 500 minutes, for a disappointing 44.74 goals-for percentage.) But when they're healthy, this is a strong group for Vegas. Max Pacioretty has 15 goals, and Paul Stastny has 18 points in 22 games. Alex Tuch is having a breakout season, with 40 points to lead the team. And their checking-line duo of Pierre-Edouard Bellemare and Ryan Reaves is a pain to play against.
Defense: B+
Deryk Engelland and Shea Theodore have been strong together, with a plus-123 in shot attempts. Nate Schmidt and Brayden McNabb have been solid offensively, while Colin Miller, Nick Holden and Jon Merrill have had their moments. Overall, the group still lacks one defenseman to tie it all together. You know, that Erik Karlsson type ...
Goalies: A-
Marc-Andre Fleury was recently voted as a midseason Vezina Trophy finalist by the PHWA, which is as reputation-based a vote as you'll find. It's not that he has been bad; with a .911 save percentage and a 3.67 goals saved above average, Fleury has been the Knights' best player during rough stretches. But this isn't the same dominance we saw in the inaugural year of the franchise. Malcolm Subban is 2-5-0 as a backup, while Fleury has played 45 games.
Special teams: B-
The Knights are a disappointing 20th on the power play (17.9), but they're fourth on the penalty kill (83.8).
Coach: A-
As he did last season in winning the Jack Adams, coach Gerard Gallant helped lead Vegas through some rough injury patches and into playoff contention.
GM: B+
George McPhee's aggressive acquisitions of Pacioretty and Stansty are finally paying off now that they're healthy. The depth on this team he built is considerable, but there are still flaws: Losing Schmidt for that PED suspension at the start of the season showed there's a lack of quality puck-movers on his blue line.
Class president: Alex Tuch
Tuch has already surpassed his previous career highs in goals and assists, with 16 tallies and 24 helpers through just 44 games.
In danger of failing: Cody Eakin
No one on the team should be worried about flunking out at this point, but Eakin hasn't had the season at even strength that his numbers (13 goals and 13 assists) might indicate. He's only a plus-2 in shot attempts on a team that's a possession monster otherwise.
Overall team grade: B+
Still a very dangerous contender, with a goaltender who keeps the team competitive nearly every night -- as in, he basically plays every night.
"
25873413,"Toronto landed a first-pairing defenseman in Jake Muzzin, but it cost the Maple Leafs two prospects and a first-rounder. We grade both GMs on the swap.
Los Angeles gets forward Carl Grundstrom and the rights to unsigned defenseman Sean Durzi in the deal, along with a first-round pick in 2019.
Muzzin is a steady veteran defenseman signed through next season at a salary cap hit of $4 million. The blue line has been Toronto's biggest weakness this season, and Muzzin could be a top-four defenseman for the Leafs, perhaps fitting in their top pairing with Morgan Rielly.
""The key is his ability to play at the top end of our defense, play in all situations, play against the other team's top players,"" Toronto general manager Kyle Dubas said. ""He's proven himself over a good career now to be able to move the puck, to excel at playing against high-quality competition and to contribute offensively.""
The 29-year-old Muzzin has four goals and 17 assists in 50 games this season, struggling at times along with his teammates in the last-place Kings' miserable year.
""I was a little shocked to get the phone call,"" Muzzin said. ""You hear rumblings and rumors and stuff like that and you just continue on with your ways until it actually happens and everything sinks in. Very excited to join Toronto.""
His departure is the biggest sign yet that general manager Rob Blake is willing to reboot the roster of a club with just one playoff victory in the past four seasons since its second Stanley Cup title.
The Kings (20-26-4) sit last in the Western Conference with 44 points from 50 games.
""I think we're in a position where we're looking up every day at the standings,"" Blake said. ""We're not happy about where we are. We're not comfortable with where we are, and now we have to make decisions for the best of the organization going forward.""
After going undrafted in 2009 and signing with Los Angeles as a free agent, Muzzin played his way into a steady NHL career with the Kings. He was a key contributor during their run to the 2014 title, scoring 12 points in 26 playoff games.
Muzzin struggled through the 2016-17 season with 28 points and a minus-21 rating, but he bounced back last season with a career-high 42 points.
Blake thinks Muzzin will handle the transition to the Eastern Conference easily after a career in the West.
""I think he's an elite defenseman,"" Blake said. ""He's going to bring the physical aspect, but he has poise and patience to make plays. I think the adjustment will come naturally for him because he is a top defenseman.""
Grundstrom, 21, was a second-round pick in 2016 and has 29 points in 42 games with Toronto's AHL affiliate this season. The 20-year-old Durzi, a second-round pick last year, has 28 points in 26 games this season in the Ontario Hockey League. Blake said the Kings like Durzi's offensive abilities.

25878045,"General manager Don Waddell said Tuesday that Martinook's extension will begin next season.
Great way to cap off one of the best weeks of my life. My family and I are so excited to be staying in Raleigh for 2 more years. Great things are coming from this team and I'm so happy to be apart of it @NHLCanes
The 26-year-old has 10 goals and three assists in 50 games while leading the team with 125 hits and blocking 28 shots -- the most by a Carolina forward.
The Hurricanes acquired him in May from Phoenix in the deal that sent center Marcus Kruger to the Coyotes. Martinook is making $1.85 million this season and would have been a restricted free agent on July 1.
It's the second extension the Hurricanes have awarded to a forward in a little over a week, also having agreed to a five-year, $27 million deal with Teuvo Teravainen on Jan. 21.
"
25871188,"The Stars had traded Oleksiak to the Penguins last season, also for a fourth-round pick in the 2019 draft. In 83 games with Pittsburgh, the 26-year-old Oleksiak had eight goals, 17 assists and a plus/minus of plus-18.
Oleksiak, drafted 14th overall by the Stars in 2011, has appeared in 140 games for Dallas, with seven goals, 15 assists and a plus/minus of minus-23.
""Our blueline has been depleted by injury all season and acquiring Jamie will give us depth at defense,"" Stars general manager Jim Nill said in a statement. ""We know him very well and we're excited to have him back in the fold.""

25862644,"Here's a look back at the weekend that was.
Central Division captain Nathan MacKinnon was a late scratch at All-Star Weekend with a bruised foot. Instead of nixing his spot in the NHL Skills Competition's fastest skater category, the league did something unconventional in naming a replacement -- which turned out to be highly impactful. Kendall Coyne Schofield, one of the speediest players on the U.S. women's national team, took MacKinnon's place and soared.
History was made and barriers were broke. It was such an honor to be the first woman to compete in the @nhl All Star Skills Competition last night. I can't wait to see what the future holds! #NHLAllStar pic.twitter.com/Sc125oBGCx
- Kendall Coyne Schofield (@KendallCoyne) January 26, 2019
It wasn't necessarily about her time (she posted a time of 14.346 seconds, which placed seventh of the eight-skater field) but about the reverberations for female athletes everywhere. ""I knew it was a moment that was going to break a lot of barriers and a moment that would change the perception of our game,"" Coyne Schofield said afterward.
The quote said it all. It's feasible that female players could play in the actual All-Star Game in the not-so-distant future.
The Dallas Stars have had a rough season, OK? They're in a wild-card position as of the break, but they're still adjusting to new coach Jim Montgomery. It's been a month since the teams' CEO went on an expletive-filled rant to call out the team's two star players, but it still feels like they're in damage control mode. One of the few bright spots? Rookie sensation Miro Heiskanen.
But when the 19-year-old got his go on a national stage in the fastest skater competition ... he wiped out like (well, no need to use another expletive here). Heiskanen took a nasty spill on the second turn, splaying out on the ice.
WHY YOU GOTTA SCARE STARS FANS LIKE THIS, MIRO?! #GoStars pic.twitter.com/cn7FXmnKJU
- SportsDay Stars (@dmn_stars) January 26, 2019
Heck, even Connor McDavid -- who perhaps can best relate to Heiskanen as a shining star on an otherwise muddled team -- cringed. ""That was a bad fall,"" McDavid said afterward. ""It was really awkward. We were all happy he was OK. Credit to him for going back out there and putting up another pretty good time.""
The Premier Passing event was premier in name only. The drill was the filler event of Friday night -- drawn out, dry and completely forgettable -- if not for Brianna Decker.
The U.S. women's national team and CWHL player demonstrated the drill with ease. Too much ease. She appeared to finish in one minute, six seconds, which bested the time of the eventual winner, Leon Draisaitl (1:09) while everyone else stumbled. By Saturday morning, there was a groundswell of support for the 27-year-old Decker. Shouldn't she deserve the $25,000 prize money? Hockey manufacturer CCM certainly thought so. The company announced on Saturday afternoon it would pay Decker $25,000 because they ""understand the importance of recognizing female hockey players."" That's not an insignificant amount of cash for a player whose salary is a fraction of her NHL counterparts'.
The murmurs began Friday. Did the clock really start on time for Decker's demo? Did she really finish ahead of Draisaitl?
Greg Wyshynski and Emily Kaplan react to the Oilers' firing of GM Peter Chiarelli (2:45). Emily caught up with Marty St. Louis, who recently joined the Blue Jackets as a special teams consultant (13:40). Former NHL goaltender and current ESPN Radio New York host Rick DiPietro chimes in on the unexpected success of the Islanders (33:49). And as always, Linda Cohn joins to answer listener questions! Listen »
On Saturday, the NHL, as well as rights holder Sportsnet, looked at the video. It turns out, Decker was a few seconds behind Draisaitl -- but also still ahead of the other seven participants. Because she didn't actually beat Draisaitl, the NHL perhaps felt it didn't need to succumb to public pressure. Instead, the league honored Decker, along with the three other women's players who were part of the skills event, by donating $25,000 in each of their names to charities of their choice.
Yes, the NHL was promoting inclusiveness by inviting the women to participate. No, it didn't owe Decker anything, especially considering she was only there to demonstrate. But the kerfuffle afterward felt unnecessary and avoidable. If it left an unsavory taste, remember the women were there to promote a three-game series between the U.S. and Canada.
So you can support Decker -- as well as Coyne Schofield, Renata Fast and Rebecca Johnston -- by tuning in, and appreciating these elite athletes when they compete in their element.
Auston Matthews, 21, has a close relationship with Toronto Maple Leafs teammate (and father figure) Patrick Marleau, 39. So Matthews decided to honor him in San Jose, where Marleau played 20 years before leaving for Toronto as a free agent. Prior to his turn in the shot accuracy event, Matthews removed his Leafs jersey to reveal one with Marleau's name and number, to the delight of the Sharks fans in the crowd as well as Marleau's former teammates in San Jose.

""It was pretty cool. Patty means a lot to just about everyone that's come through this organization. It was pretty cool of him to do that,"" said Sharks captain Joe Pavelski, who took a photo with Matthews and San Jose All-Stars Erik Karlsson and Brent Burns. ""Of course, we should have turned [Matthews] around. We just wanted the number on the back.""
Last season, Brent Burns competed in the NHL's hardest shot competition. While he looks like a guy who could blast the puck, his top speed was 92.4 mph.
""Nah,"" Los Angeles Kings defenseman Drew Doughty said of Burns's hardest shot chances, ""Burnzy's got a muffin. He takes wristers.""
Fast forward a year, and maybe he's got more than a muffin, topping out at 100.6 mph. The problem? He totally missed the net on his first attempt, bumming out the Sharks fans cheering him on.
The Save Streak might have been the most exciting component of the NHL All-Star Skills Competition, thanks in large part to King Henrik. The New York Rangers goalie made 12 straight saves to defeat Tampa Bay Lightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy (who had eight).
Lundqvist made his eighth stop on Vasilevskiy's teammate Steven Stamkos, and then won the event in dramatic fashion, making a save on former New York Islanders rival and current Maple Leafs star John Tavares. Outstanding goaltending and a little drama made for a memorable event.
On the other end of the goaltending spectrum was the Ducks goalie, who gave up seven goals (!) on nine shots in the first half of the Pacific Division's NHL All-Star Game against the Central, which they'd lose 10-4. The San Jose fans watching their Sharks All-Stars eliminated by Gibson's goaltending responded by chanting, ""Ducks Suck.""
Said Gibson after the game: ""It is what it is."" (You'd figure he'd be used to this shot volume, playing in Anaheim.)
The Metropolitan Division earned just the third penalty shot in All-Star Game history against the Central with 4:09 left in the first half. Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Seth Jones took the puck and ...
Not Seth Jones' finest moment. #NHLAllStar pic.twitter.com/MM2gGuYZPB

... Jones forgot to put the ""shot"" in ""penalty shot."" But he made up for it later with an absolutely gorgeous pass to set up a Kyle Palmieri goal.
The NHL did another major test of its puck tracking technology with its broadcast partners, and it offered some fairly cool options. Players on the ice were identified by CGI name tag, with real-time stats like time on ice and their speed displayed. The chip inside the puck allowed for the speed of shots and passes to be conveyed instantly.
The players' wearable technology made it possible to draw lines between defenders on the ice, showing exactly how far away they were spaced. As far as a way to collect data, player and puck tracking is going to change the way we compile stats. As a way to display that information, it showed some promise on television.

On Friday, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said that the infamous ""glow puck"" would not be returning, despite the shared DNA between the current puck-tracking technology and the tech used to create that glowing monstrosity in the 1990s.
While the All-Star Game broadcasts' puck didn't glow, it did have a distracting black ""tail"" that was reminiscent of the garish display of the glow puck. It was a bit much.
Holding the NHL All-Star Game in Silicon Valley produced some innovating thinking -- like jerseys literally made from recycled ocean garbage -- and a cheeky emoji motif for many of the weekend's graphics. That included digital cartoon faces rather than player headshots on display during the games.
Those cartoons also ended up in a rather hilarious place: On the targets of the shot accuracy skills competition. So players were literally shooting at the faces of Drew Doughty and Auston Matthews. (Now, imagine how much more successful these players would have been had all the targets featured Brad Marchand ...)
Coming out of the intermission during the skills competition was the single most tedious 20 minutes of NHL All-Star Weekend: the Premier Passer event. On the one hand, it was an exemplary display of true hockey skill. On the other hand, it was a cringe-inducing snore as the NHL's best and brightest struggled to carry the puck through elevated barriers and pass the puck into demonic little mini-nets.
You could replace this event with a three-hour long discussion of escrow, and it would be 150 percent more exciting. Please, no more of the Premier Passer event.
Sharks fans showered the Toronto star with boos all weekend, thanks to his decision last summer to sign a blockbuster free-agent contract with the Maple Leafs after an aggressive courtship by San Jose. You have to love that level of passionate pettiness.

""I wasn't really sure what to expect. Obviously, a very proud fan base. They love their Sharks. They always create a great atmosphere, great environment when you come to play here on the road,"" Tavares told ESPN. ""I wasn't the only one [who was booed], so I wasn't lonely.""
C'mon, San Jose. Rare is the All-Star Game in which Sidney Crosby participates, and you're going to boo him for, what, depriving the Sharks the Stanley Cup with a Conn Smythe-winning performance three years ago?
""I kind of expected that,"" said Crosby of the jeers during his MVP presentation. ""I watched last night and saw the reaction that [Kris Letang] got.""

25899522,"The league and National Hockey League Players' Association will announce the joint initiative Friday morning. It includes a traveling mobile museum devoted to the history of minorities in hockey predating Willie O'Ree breaking the color barrier in 1958 and leading to the present day. The museum will debut outside Madison Square Garden in New York on Saturday.
As part of this, ""Hockey Is For Everyone"" is expanding to year-round. March will be gender-equality month, and the plan is to add acknowledgement of Hispanic heritage and First Nations next season.
There are roughly 20 black players currently on NHL rosters, though executive vice president of social impact, growth initiatives and legislative affairs Kim Davis said there is strong minority representation at youth levels.
""I think a focus like this during Black History Month will affirm those many kids of color that are already playing our game,"" Davis said. ""I think we often underestimate the pipeline of talent that is already involved in our game.""
USA Hockey only recently began collecting data on player participation by race, so it will take some time to show if the sport that is predominantly white at its highest levels is making inroads. Davis added that another aim is to educate all fans on the contributions of all races during hockey's history.
O'Ree, who has worked since 1996 as NHL diversity ambassador and director of youth development, said he is proud the league is celebrating black history and has seen progress in more kids playing hockey over his two decades on the job.
Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Seth Jones, one of several black stars who will be the subject of video specials this month, said ""important conversations and perspectives will be shared as part of the Black History Month celebration.""
Nashville Predators defenseman P.K. Subban, San Jose Sharks forward Evander Kane and Hall of Famers Grant Fuhr and Angela James will also be among those featured.

25893253,"Vermette announced on Thursday he was calling it a career after 14 NHL seasons with the Ottawa Senators, Columbus Blue Jackets, Arizona Coyotes, Chicago Blackhawks and Anaheim Ducks. The 36-year-old from Quebec won the Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks in 2015 and most recently played for the Ducks, but he didn't sign with a team after becoming a free agent last summer.
""I am immensely grateful for all these incredible years punctuated by memorable moments that I will cherish forever,"" Vermette said in a statement sent through the NHL Players' Association. ""It was a privilege sharing my daily life with teammates, to forging friendships that will endure well beyond the victories and defeats.""
In the faceoff circle, Vermette had far more victories than defeats. He won 56.6 percent of his faceoffs, the ninth-best mark since the league began tracking the statistic in 1997-98.
Vermette's 8,948 faceoff wins are 14th-most all-time, and he led the league in faceoff percentage in his final season in 2017-18. Longtime agent Allan Walsh said Vermette constantly worked on his faceoff techniques always looking for an edge and was proud of his expertise in that department.
""He was a guy that would always be relied upon to go out there in key moments of a game, especially faceoffs in the defensive zone or offensive zone to go out there and win the faceoff,"" Walsh said. ""We know how important possession is nowadays. Being able to control the puck on the (power play or penalty kill) or the last minute and a half of the game with a faceoff in the O-zone with the goalie on the bench is sometimes half the battle right there.""
Vermette put up 228 goals and 287 assists for 515 points in 1,046 regular-season games. He had 28 points and a faceoff percentage of 57.9 during 97 playoff games and helped the Blackhawks win the Cup in 2015 after being picked up at the trade deadline.
""Obviously, he played a different role based on how strong the team was and especially down the middle,"" Walsh said. ""He's a guy that whether it was to be more of a two-way shutdown guy or to be counted on to provide offense, he had some years where he scored a lot of goals and put up a lot of points.""
Vermette also had a 482-game ironman streak that lasted from March 2009 until October 2015.

Hey, are you interested in a pending free agent Ottawa Senators forward who is going to cost you significantly less than Matt Duchene and Mark Stone? Then you're probably feeling a Dzingel run down your leg for an exciting 26-year-old who is having a career year (in a contract year). That cap hit means every team looking for offense on the wing -- from the Bruins to the Islanders to the Sharks to the Avalanche -- will be in the market here. Dzingel is your prototypical ""guy who seems like he won't cost much in a trade who someone ends up overpaying for because several teams coveted him"" type of deadline player.

Ferland was likely gone well before the Hurricanes added Nino Niederreiter at $5.25 million annually through 2022, but that deal probably cemented it. Ferland is a physical winger with offensive pop, and he is a pain in the kiester to play against.

Though there's always a chance the Devils go on another two-month tear to make the playoffs, that's hard to envision given the trajectory of this group. They have several assets they can move -- from veteran forward Brian Boyle and defenseman Ben Lovejoy to potentially goalie Keith Kinkaid -- but Johansson might have the most value despite two years of injury issues and a drop in production. He can still be a fine offensive complement on a line with better players, and he could be had for a third-round pick and/or a prospect.

According to Cap Friendly, Maroon's no-trade clause goes from a full one to a partial eight-team one on Feb. 1, which makes him seem like either a man who knows he is portable, or a man who wants to be.

A tough one to figure out. On the one hand, the Ducks like him and he's the kind of offensive player who should bolster their attack in their desperate pursuit of a wild-card spot. On the other, he's a 28-year-old pending UFA and might he seeking a deal a shade too rich for the Anaheim cap. (Thanks, unmovable veteran contracts!) He should be coveted as a rental if available, given his versatility and solid playoff numbers (39 points in his last 44 postseason games).

The term ""last piece of the puzzle"" gets tossed around a lot at this time of the season, but Simmonds would certainly complete the picture for a lot of teams. He has a net-front presence offensively. His 67 penalty minutes are indicative of his toughness. He can play top-six minutes. And he's a left wing, which everyone seems to be chasing at the deadline. The Bruins seem like a natural fit here, and they're worth mentioning when it comes to cost: Would Simmonds fetch the kind of bounty that Rick Nash did from the Bruins last season -- a first, a roster player and a prospect (along with a seventh and what was left of Matt Beleskey)?

Bruce Garrioch of the Ottawa Sun reports that the Senators have talked to Stone about a deal between $8.5 and 9.5 million AAV for eight seasons. If he opts not to return, he rockets up the board for available wingers. Stone should be mentioned in the same Selke Trophy-contender breath as two-way stars like Patrice Bergeron and Anze Kopitar -- he's that good, except he does it on the wing. He'd easily fetch a first-round pick and a blue-chipper in return. Unlike with Matt Duchene, I think whoever snags Stone does so with an eye toward retaining him, rather than renting him.

Seeing Vanek available at the trade deadline is like seeing those McDonald's arches on the road during a long drive: Familiar, comfortable, but maybe not the thing you really need. Sure, he was effective in 19 games for the Blue Jackets after last trade deadline, with 15 points ... until he had just two in six playoff games, both coming in Game 1 against the Capitals. You know what you get: Some streaky even-strength offense and a defensive liability. Complicating matters: As we noted in our team-by-team deadline primer, Ken Holland gave Thomas Vanek -- a player who exists to be traded at this point in his career -- a no-trade clause.

He would provide a contender with a dynamic offensive center, but he would certainly cost a first-rounder and a significant prospect.

To the surprise of no one, Hayes is having his best season on average in the NHL right before it's time for that big extension. The 6-foot-5 center has been good for the Rangers, but their future up the gut lies with Mika Zibanejad and Filip Chytil, rather than with Hayes. Getting a young pivot like this at the deadline is increasingly rare. Whoever acquires Hayes will part with a first-rounder and potentially an NHL-ready piece. On a good, deep team (like Boston), he would be a perfect third-line center rental. But we have a feeling teams are going to be after him to then keep him around for a few years. The Rangers have scouted the Avalanche to the point that local media thinks there's a fit.

Chiarelli was hired as GM and president of hockey operations in April 2015, following a run of nine seasons as general manager of the Boston Bruins, with whom he won the Stanley Cup in 2011. But his tenure in Edmonton was filled with controversial transactions, a failure to surround star Connor McDavid with sufficient talent and a lack of success on the ice, as the Oilers advanced to the second round of the playoffs in 2017 but otherwise failed to make the postseason in each of Chiarelli's seasons at the helm.
In April 2018, Chiarelli received a vote of confidence from Oilers CEO Bob Nicholson at a postseason news conference following Edmonton's 12th-place finish in the Western Conference. ""We had a down year, but I talked to Peter, and he has a plan to get us back in the playoffs next season,"" he said.
Whatever the plan was, it didn't work.
Edmonton began the season 9-10-1, resulting in Chiarelli firing coach Todd McLellan, whom he hired in 2015, and hiring veteran coach Ken Hitchcock in an attempt to salvage the season and his job.
""I think [the roster] is good enough. But none of us can absolve ourselves in this situation, including the players. I think they can be better,"" Chiarelli said when Hitchcock was hired.
Hitchcock has gone 14-13-2, leading to a 23-23-3 record overall. While the Oilers are just three points out of the last wild-card spot in the Western Conference, they've lost three games in a row and are 4-6-0 in their past 10 games. With the NHL All-Star break having arrived, the Oilers decided to use the time off as a chance to regroup, minus their general manager.
Chiarelli's legacy with the Oilers will be one of bold moves that backfired:
• He acquired defenseman Griffin Reinhart from the New York Islanders in June 2015; Reinhart played 29 games for the Oilers and is now in the Vegas Golden Knights' minor league system. The first-round pick sent to the Islanders by Edmonton in the trade was used to draft Mathew Barzal, the 2017-18 NHL rookie of the year.
• He signed hulking winger Milan Lucic, who played for Chiarelli in Boston, to a seven-year contract in July 2016. Slow and lumbering at a time when the NHL treasures speed, he has just 15 goals in his past 131 games, while his contract was rich with bonus money and trade protection.
• In one of the most lopsided trades in recent memory, Chiarelli sent star winger Taylor Hall to the New Jersey Devils for defenseman Adam Larsson in a one-for-one trade in June 2016. Hall won the Hart Trophy as NHL MVP last season.
• He traded scoring winger Jordan Eberle to the Islanders for forward Ryan Strome in a cost-saving move in June 2017. Strome scored 14 goals in 100 games for the Oilers, before he was traded to the New York Rangers in November 2018 for center Ryan Spooner. Spooner was placed on waivers by Chiarelli this week after he notched just three points in 24 games.
Chiarelli made another controversial move roughly 24 hours before his firing, signing goalie Mikko Koskinen to a three-year, $13.5 million contract extension with trade protection. Koskinen was the goalie of record in the Oilers' loss to the Red Wings on Wednesday night.
Chiarelli's firing comes roughly a month before the NHL trade deadline.

25818038,"""It's like working for a startup,"" says team chief operating officer Victor DeBonis. By the time the arena opens in 2021, DeBonis projects there will be about 1,000 on staff.
The NHL's board of governors unanimously voted to accept Seattle as the 32nd franchise in December, but opted to begin play in 2021, not a season earlier -- which gave the Seattle team the luxury of slowing down, but also a brief scare. Momentum had been cascading. Seattle had racked up 32,000 season ticket deposits for the 17,000-seat arena. ""We were a little nervous that some folks might back out when they pushed it back a year,"" team CEO Tod Leiweke said. In the following week, only four people dropped out. Then 5,000 more were added to the wait list.
Interest in the team feels limitless. Thank the Vegas Golden Knights, who set a new standard for how quickly expansion teams can thrive. Another factor: Seattle leadership, a group of seasoned sports executives, have challenged themselves to create a perfect team, blending a new level of fan engagement with a cutting-edge arena that could integrate seamlessly into one of the fastest-growing cities in America.
""It feels like it's more than just an expansion team,"" says Dave Tippett, who is still the only member of the team's hockey operations department. ""We've talked about it here -- we'd like this to be a legacy franchise, a franchise that 50 years from now, everyone looks back on and says, 'Wow, that's the way to do it.'""
So yeah, people want in. Tippett receives, on average, two to three résumés per day. ""I've even gotten résumés for Zamboni drivers,"" he says. Let's just say those fall to the bottom of the pile, for now.
The objective now is laying out the dream with broad strokes, and filling in the details. Here's what that looks like.
Vegas hired its general manager, George McPhee, in July 2016, 15 months before the team's inaugural game. He spent the summer filling out the hockey operations staff and, by the fall, scouts were dispatched to games. Since Seattle was given an extra year, leadership isn't sure if it should follow the same timeline.
""There's an economic question,"" Leiweke says of adding too many jobs on payroll two years out. ""But our ownership has been awesome and said, 'Don't let that rule the day.'"" The ownership group, which is led by majority owner/investment banker David Bonderman, already has committed nearly $2 billion -- between the $650 million expansion fee, $70 million practice facility and arena, which has jumped to $850 million in costs -- up $200 million from initial projections.

In talking to Seattle leadership, you get the sense they may prefer to hire a general manager this spring. Since other teams will be better prepared for an expansion draft, Seattle wants a head start as well. To that end, Tippett has a software program, developed by interns, that allows him to mock draft from current NHL teams' rosters, but of course, much will change before the June 2021 draft.
Once the GM is hired, countless other decisions will fall on this person -- ranging from how to structure the European scouting staffs to hiring the first coach -- so filling the position will allow the group to move forward on that front.
Tippett has a master spreadsheet with tabs for every potential job in hockey operations. When someone has expressed interest in a job, he plugs in their name. There are other candidates Tippett has identified himself. ""They don't know their name is on there,"" he says. As of now, Tippett says there are ""10 or 12 viable candidates out there, and as we move on, we'll try to get that a little lower.""
""We're going to go through our search [this spring] and see how things go,"" Tippett says. ""If the right person is there, then maybe we'll hire two years out. If we don't find the right person, we'll wait.""
Recently, a lot of Tippett's energy has been poured into identifying an AHL franchise. Building out a successful minor league affiliate is crucial for an NHL team's success. Last season, there were roughly 6,000 NHL games played by recalled players. On average, that's five or six recalled players per night. The AHL has 31 franchises and, according to league president and CEO Dave Andrews, ""will hopefully expand at the same rate and at the same time as the NHL.""

Tippett has had steady communication with the AHL office and has scouted several potential locations.
""There are some turnkey ones that you go into with a partnership, and everything is in place,"" Tippett says. ""There might be a new situation where you go into where we build a team right from scratch there. If we do a turnkey one, we don't have to do anything for a year or two. If we do a whole new situation, we might have to start going quicker.""
The preference would be to not share an affiliate, as Vegas did with the Chicago Wolves in its first season. ""I don't think that's what they would like to do -- it's not the ideal way to go about it,"" Andrews says. ""Vegas did it because we were kind of backed up a year."" (In a game of musical chairs, the AHL had added the Colorado Eagles, formerly of the ECHL, as an expansion franchise, but not until 2018-19. The Avalanche wanted Colorado as its affiliate, but they were still in San Antonio. The Blues were in Chicago but wanted to go to San Antonio. And thus the year of sharing between the Blues and Golden Knights.)
Once Seattle settles on a location, the AHL board of governors must approve the new team by a three-fourths vote. There is an expansion fee, though Andrews declined to say how much, only offering, ""It's definitely not $650 million."" (Sources say it's a fraction of that.) ""I wouldn't expect it would lead to realignment,"" Andrews says. ""I think Dave [Tippett]'s primary objective would be to land in the Pacific Division, and we have space for another team in there.""
The renovated arena -- formerly Key Arena, where the Sonics used to play -- is nestled in the same public park that houses the Space Needle. The current tenants, the WNBA Storm, have been temporarily relocated but will return when the project is done, hopefully by spring 2021. The naming rights for Key Arena actually expired in 2011, but the Key Arena sign remained. A new sponsor never emerged and nobody wanted to pay to extricate the sign. DeBonis and Leiweke say they are in discussion with several companies for naming rights. ""It's been pretty overwhelming with the amount of interest,"" DeBonis says.
The arena's historic roof is wide and triangular. ""The beauty of it is, if you have a traditional arena, it would dominate the landscape and overtake the campus,"" DeBonis says. ""This is elegant. You actually don't know what it is. It could be anything. It's like you're in Paris, you go to the Louvre. Where is the museum? Right? It's kind of like that.""
Adds Leiweke: ""We have to break the perception that this is a renovation. This is an entire new arena under an historic roof. It's going to be epic. It's going to be tight -- we're digging down, so it defines the steepness of this. We're going to go from 400,000 to 750,000 square feet. There are a lot of engineers that are going to earn honorary doctorates after this project. The bowl is going to remain very tight and intimate. There's not going to be a bad seat in the house. When you're OK sitting in the last seat in the last row because it's actually pretty good views, that says something. Our ambition is to add the tightest, most compelling bowl in all the world of sports.""
Just as ... no one predicted, the John Tavares-less Isles are in first place in the Metro Division on Jan. 21. Where do they wind up?
The NHL trade season is underway. Get caught up on the assets, restrictions and potential moves for every team ahead of the Feb. 25 deadline.
Presenting the case for the Blue Jackets' trio of Panarin, Atkinson and Dubois. Plus, a grand larceny took place in the Nino Niederreiter trade.
Tippett, who used to own a building company, has been intimately involved in the floor plans for both the practice facility and the arena. He has toured other league facilities, taking note of how much space is necessary for dressing rooms (noting how a few teams do have ""wasted space"") but also what the modern player needs. For example, it was important to have a common area separate from the locker room and cafeteria that every player, coach and member of the training staff has to go through to foster a ""family atmosphere"" -- but also a ""spa"" of tubs outside the bathroom that can be a players-only space to unwind after games.
""When it comes to the visiting dressing room and other amenities, we're kind of in the Mark Cuban school of thought where we want anyone who walks in to be impressed,"" Tippett says. ""As far as for our team, it needs to be somewhere that a player or coach can walk in and say, 'I can do my best here.'""
The city is looking forward to a revived arena, also.
""Key Arena had a pretty good run of attracting a lot of entertainment and concerts in a subpar facility,"" says Jon Scholes, president/CEO of the Downtown Seattle Association. ""They were doing OK over the last five or six years in increasing bookings after the Sonics left. But what the Oak View Group is doing and quality of design is going to position them to attract a lot more.""
Key Arena had below-grade loading docks that deterred some larger acts, and that will be fixed. ""We want this venue to be a top-five venue in North America,"" DeBonis says. ""Everyone understands hockey is 41 [home] games, there will potentially be double the number of concerts and events that happen there. Really powerhouse events. We would like to get a two [as in 200] in front of the number of events we have here. I think we can do it. And I think there's a demand.""
Earlier this month, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said he promised an All-Star Game and draft to Seattle within their first seven years. It hasn't been confirmed, but Leiweke says he is hoping to secure the 2021 draft, which will coincide with the expansion draft. Bettman seemed less enthused by Seattle hosting a Winter Classic, citing conditions as a concern. That won't stop Seattle from pursuing the event anyway. ""It doesn't always rain like people think,"" Leiweke says. ""We have a great facility here in T-Mobile [Park] -- the roof can close in short order. But we'll get to that in time.""
Every principal and design of the renovated arena has kept in mind being able to accommodate an NBA team as well. ""We're never going to get in front of the NBA, we're never going to get in front of the commissioner,"" Leiweke says. ""But we'll be ready for that opportunity when it comes. ... Our ambition is to create one of the greatest arenas in the world, and the NBA should certainly be a part of that at some point in time. But, one miracle at a time.""
""Vegas did something that's amazing and something that really worked in that market,"" DeBonis says. ""They found the secret sauce, and other teams in the league have the secret sauce too. Not like Vegas, but in their own way. Montreal, Chicago, Nashville -- there are some major energized fans. So we have to find the secret sauce here.""
Seattle is leaning into fan engagement. ""I've always said when you listen to your fans, you can't go wrong,"" Leiweke says. ""We have a chance here, with the time we have, with the leadership team we have, with the incredible interest of the fans, to do it a little differently than anyone's ever done it.""
They're in the final stages of launching a fan portal that will allow for input on, well, everything. After all, this is the same city where the MLS franchise allows its fans to vote on a GM.
""The fans are going to be involved in every decision,"" Leiweke says. ""We can't have a fan vote on the general manager, but we're going to glean from the fans some things that might be enlightening as we interview the general manager, and we'll do that on every subject matter.""
Adds Tippett: ""We have a tech committee that's talking about how we're going to interact with fans in game. Everything from ordering food to going on your phone and figuring out where the shortest line is to go to the bathroom.""

Nailing the game presentation is important, and they want to curate an experience that is authentic to the city. Neighboring the arena is KEXP, one of the most successful public radio stations in the world. Lewieke began discussions about working with the station, and eventually discussed a partnership. ""They're going to handcraft the music, from walk-in to warm-up to the anthem, to goal songs, to victory songs,"" Leiweke says. ""I mean, it's just cool. They're totally stoked up to do it.""
The fan portal will include voting on the one area everyone seems to care most about: the team name. The team already has had about six serious brainstorming sessions during which they go through name options.
""I've been in some of those meetings, and I kind of sit there as they go through some things and they look at me,"" Tippett says. ""'Would a hockey player wear that? Would a hockey player like that?' I say, 'That's good,' or, 'I'd back away from that one.' There's some names that I think sound all right, but they go through the entire branding part of it and you realize, ehh, maybe not. There are other ones that don't sound right, but they go through the whole story of it and I go, 'Hey, maybe.'""
Says Leiweke: ""The name, at end of the day, rests with David Bonderman. We're gathering input, but sometimes fans also want to be led. There might be some names that haven't been out there because we're marshaling really powerful thought leaders on this.""
One aspect of the franchise that has been understated is the practice facility, which will sit by the Northgate Mall. Built in 1950, it was one of the first major indoor shopping centers in America. But, characteristic of an evolving retail industry, foot traffic is drying up as department stores have closed. According to Scholes, with the Downtown Seattle Association, the addition of the practice facility will be ""transformative."" ""It will really be catalytic to attracting further investments,"" he says.
Another group thrilled by the new facility: the youth hockey community. ""You don't sell 30,000 tickets without some level of enthusiasm,"" says Donna Kaufman, USA Hockey's vice president and Junior Council chair.
There's bustling interest in hockey, which is capped by the lack of facilities. Frankly, it's expensive to build in the city. When Kaufman first became involved in the Tacoma Youth Ice Hockey Association in 1992, there were only nine sheets of ice in the entire state. Now there are 10 to 15 sheets, depending on how you count. ""Every organization is pretty well maxed of what they can do,"" she says. ""Youth hockey will only grow by as many rinks that we have now.""
Every American city the NHL has entered has seen a jolt of youth hockey participation. Seattle is feeling it already. In Tacoma, Kaufman said 40 attended the learn-to-play session last season. This fall there were 80. ""We're hearing the same thing in Seattle,"" she says. ""And the team wasn't even here yet -- we didn't even know until December that it was official.""
According to USA Hockey, there were 4,405 registered players in the state in 2017-18, including 1,389 boys and 355 girls. Those figures are expected to grow. The three sheets of ice at the practice facility are going to be a boon. ""Other than the three or four hours a day that we need it, those sheets will be all open,"" Tippett says.
""We don't want to come over [and] take anything over -- we just want to be a partner and help grow the game with everybody.""

Though some veterans may be tired of the routine, it's a big deal to newbies. Plus, Jersey Fouls, the Week in Gritty and more!
Dodgeball on ice, human bowling and the 100-on-3 challenge? Let's get nuts with 10 suggestions on new events for the NHL stars.
Can anyone top the Lightning? Not yet! Plus, a look back at the shining All-Star Weekend moment for every franchise.
""Nate's here in San Jose for #NHLAllStar, but has someone else in mind to compete for Fastest Skater,"" the Avs said in the tweet. ""@KendallCoyne, what do you think!?""
Kendall Coyne Schofield's response?
""My first impression was like, I can do this,"" she said.
A 5-foot-2 forward and gold medalist for the U.S. women's national team, Coyne Schofield, 26, became the first woman to compete in the NHL All-Star skills competition. In the fastest skater event, she posted a time of 14.346, which placed seventh out of a field that also included Connor McDavid, Cam Atkinson, Mathew Barzal, Jack Eichel, Miro Heiskanen, Clayton Keller and Elias Pettersson. Coyne Schofield finished ahead of Keller's 14.526 seconds. McDavid won in 13.378, his third straight title in the event.
""Obviously I was a little nervous,"" Coyne Schofield said afterward. ""But I knew it was a moment that was going to break a lot of barriers and a moment that would change the perception of our game.""
Coyne Schofield, who plays for the NWHL's Minnesota Whitecaps, impressed the crowd -- who began chanting ""USA! USA!"" -- as well as the other skaters.
""When she took off, I was like, 'Wow,'"" McDavid said. ""I thought she won the event.""
Added Toronto Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews: ""She was flying. I was giving Keller a hard time because she beat him. She came out for warm-ups, was buzzing around, and everyone was taking notice.""
And Calgary Flames winger Johnny Gaudreau: ""It's pretty impressive, obviously. It's great. It's really cool. And she's American, so it's even better.""
Coyne Schofield was originally slated to attend the event and demonstrate the skills, along with other female players. She found out about that a few weeks ago. But she didn't learn of her inclusion in the fastest skater event until Friday, hours before the competition. She enjoyed hanging out with the other All-Stars, whom she called ""awesome"" and ""so supportive.""
""They kept telling me they were a little nervous I would beat them,"" Coyne Schofield said. ""I had full confidence in them, so to see them have full confidence in me is pretty cool.""
MacKinnon will not play in Saturday night's All-Star Game. However, he is in San Jose participating in the festivities, meaning he will avoid the mandatory one-game suspension for skipping the skills event.
Coyne Schofield wasn't the only woman to impress Friday night. U.S. teammate Brianna Decker demonstrated the passing competition with a completed time of 1:06. There was a bit of confusion as to when the clock actually started, but it appeared she might have upped NHL All-Star winner Leon Draisaitl's time of 1:09.
""It just shows the top players, men or women, belong,"" Coyne Schofield said.
"
25852611,"Leaders from the NHL and the NHLPA expressed optimism that they can avoid another work stoppage as they disclosed they've begun ""cordial"" CBA discussions.
It will be both teams' first appearance in the event, which is now entering its 12th year.
Additionally, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Los Angeles Kings will play the Colorado Avalanche at the 2020 Stadium Series on Feb. 15, which will be held at U.S. Air Force Academy's Falcon Stadium in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
That will be the second regular-season outdoor game for the Avalanche and the third such game for the Kings.
""We're confident that this will have the absolute best pregame flyover that anyone's ever seen,"" Bettman said.

25894225,"Last Friday, Coyne Schofield, a U.S. national team player and forward for the NWHL Minnesota Whitecaps, became the first woman to participate in NHL All-Star Weekend, competing in the fastest skater skills event. That piggybacked into a gig on Wednesday serving as a guest analyst on NBC Sports' broadcast of the Pittsburgh Penguins versus Tampa Bay Lightning game.
In a pregame segment, however, many viewers took notice of the way Coyne Schofield was treated by her male counterpart, NBC analyst Pierre McGuire.
""Tampa's gonna be on your left, Pittsburgh's gonna be on your right,"" McGuire explained to Coyne Schofield during a pregame hit. ""What are you expecting out of this game? We're paying you to be an analyst, not to be a fan tonight.""
In a lengthy note posted on Twitter on Thursday afternoon, Coyne Schofield addressed the incident, which went viral. She said she has known McGuire ""for years"" and knows he ""respects me as a hockey player, a woman, and a friend and that is why I didn't think twice about our on-air exchange when it happened.""
However, after receiving ""countless messages"" about the incident after the game, Coyne Schofield said she went back and looked at the video.
""I understand why people would think it was inappropriate,"" she wrote. ""If I were watching it at home and saw a man say this to a woman athlete, I would have been offended.""
Coyne Schofield went on to say she knew ""how excited Pierre was for me and to be a part of this moment"" although she wished ""it came out differently.""
McGuire professed his ""utmost respect"" for Coyne Schofield in a statement issued on Thursday.
""I've known Kendall for years and have had the privilege of covering her as a member of Team USA at the past two Winter Olympics,"" the statement read. ""We were all thrilled to have her join our coverage last night, but at times my excitement got the better of me and I should have chosen my words better. I have the utmost respect for Kendall as a world-class player, analyst of the game, and role model.""
Ultimately, the discussion centered on questioning a woman's hockey knowledge. Coyne Schofield wanted to use her new profile to share a message.
""What is important is for every young girl reading this to know that it doesn't matter what anyone thinks of my hockey knowledge -- because I do not doubt my hockey knowledge,"" she wrote. ""I didn't need a gold medal to come to that conclusion. I needed belief in myself. That took time to build and I would never let someone else undo all of that work on the ice -- and especially off.""
With Nathan MacKinnon out of Friday night's NHL All-Star skills competition with a foot injury, he was replaced by Kendall Coyne Schofield. A member of the U.S. women's national team, she is the first woman to compete in the event.
The Olympic gold medalist responded with grace in an unfortunate situation. Plus, the Week in Gritty, Jersey Fouls and more.
Coyne Schofield, 26, studied communications at Northeastern University and has previous experience as a sideline reporter for the Northeastern men's hockey team. Her assignment on Wednesday included reporting from between the benches during the game, as well as intermission analysis.
Coyne Schofield was included in the fastest skater event in San Jose after Colorado Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon dropped out late because of a bruised foot.
Coyne Schofield posted a time of 14.346, which placed seventh out of a field that also included Connor McDavid, Cam Atkinson, Mathew Barzal, Jack Eichel, Miro Heiskanen, Clayton Keller and Elias Pettersson. Coyne finished ahead of Keller's 14.526 seconds. McDavid won in 13.378, his third straight title in the event.

25815843,"Will they remain there for the rest of the campaign, or slip out of the playoff mix altogether?
Greg Wyshynski, senior NHL writer: The Islanders have 62 points in 48 games -- three points ahead of second-place Columbus. They're eight points clear of the Buffalo Sabres, who sit right outside the wild-card bubble. As shocking as all of this is, it would be just as shocking now if the Islanders missed the playoffs. The math is very much in their favor.

Which pairings would be most entertaining? Plus, fallout from the 2020 World Cup cancellation, the Week in Gritty, Jersey Fouls and more.
Speaking of math, the Islanders are all over the stats map. Their 47.93 Corsi for percentage is sixth worst in the NHL, but they're ninth in shots allowed (30.3 per game). They get 48.89 percent of the five-on-five scoring chances, but they've gotten 56.88 percent of the high-danger goals scored at even strength. They're 16th in goals per game (2.98) but first in team save percentage (.919). As Andrew Gross noted, the Islanders have allowed ""one goal or fewer 18 times this season, including the last five games, and have kept opponents under 20 shots in three straight games."" That's tremendous, but does that add up to postseason success?
I think so. Barry Trotz, your 2018-19 Jack Adams Award winner, has this team playing a style and a structure that's going to be really difficult to break through against in a seven-game series. But there's something else going on here: There's that chip on their shoulder. Maybe it's what the punditry said before the season about the team and the players or John Tavares leaving or Trotz and Lou Lamoriello on their own redemption tours. There's a defiance and a resolve here that's become undeniable. I'm not sure they have the horses to win the conference, but they have what it takes to win a playoff round.
If only the hockey gods would deliver unto us a Capitals vs. Islanders divisional series.
Dimitri Filipovic, hockey analytics writer: It's not the sexiest take in the internet era, when everything needs to either be the absolute worst or the very best, but there's surely a reasonable middle ground for the Islanders to settle in between now and the end of the regular season. I don't know very many people who predicted that they'd be this good after the sobering summer they had, and whenever a team blows our collective expectations out of the water the way they have thus far, there's typically some level of pushback to it and nitpicking of it that follows. But here's the thing: Even if they might not actually be the best team in the Metropolitan Division as the standings would currently suggest, there's plenty of reasons for optimism that they'll be able to still hang around in the playoff race moving forward.
If you're looking for a fly in the Islanders' ointment here, you don't have to overexert yourself. As a team, they're currently first in save percentage at both five-on-five and in all situations. They're also fourth in shooting percentage at five-on-five, and ninth overall. Even if you're a subscriber to the idea that there is some wrinkle in Barry Trotz's heralded system that organically inflates those figures, history has understandably instilled a level of uneasiness that's associated with a team that's relying on great numbers in those categories to win games.

That overall package doesn't tell the full story, however. While their underlying shot metrics aren't particularly sparkling, they've actually been perfectly fine since an ugly opening month of the season. After an October in which they were 30th in the league in shot attempts (42.2 percent differential) and shots on goal (40.9 percent), they've progressively been trending upward and improving in both categories ever since they called up and started utilizing some of their younger pieces like Devon Toews, Michael Dal Colle and Josh Ho-Sang. In nearly 25 games since Dec. 1, they've skyrocketed all the way up to 10th in shot attempts (52.1 percent) and 12th in shots on goal (51.5 percent). In typical fashion for a Trotz team, they've stumbled upon a formula that works: They slow the game down (only the Blues play at a slower pace), limit the events that take place, and control what happens around the net.
I'm willing to give them a pass for that early-season hole, and believe that this recent sample they've put together is more indicative of their true talent level. If that really is the case, that's more than good enough to give them a fighting chance on most nights considering how good their goaltending has been throughout. I'm still skeptical that they possess enough offensive firepower to deal with the top teams in a playoff series, but just the fact that that's a legitimate discussion now is a testament to how far the outlook for the Islanders has come in such a short period of time.

Through radio frequencies, antennas around the arena track their motion, capturing a plethora of data and mapping out their locations. This technology could revolutionize how hockey is presented on television, how teams collect statistical data on players and, ultimately, how fans wager on the sport.
There is no biometric information collected with these sensors, just game events.
""We'll know who took the shot, where the shot was taken, how fast the puck was moving. It's going to create new opportunities for telling stories,"" said Dave Lehanski, senior vice president of business development for the NHL.
The technology will allow broadcasters to have real-time stats integrated into their games, presented with computer-generated imaging on the screen. Viewers could instantly see the velocity of shots, the amount of ice time for a given player or where players are on the ice at a given time. The data collected from the games would allow companies to recreate them digitally in a virtual-reality environment. And yes, the chip inside the puck could even resurrect the ""glow puck"" used on broadcasts two decades ago, only with much more accuracy and less garishly.
Player- and puck-tracking technology has been in the works since 2013, with several attempts using different kind of technology. That included tests at the 2015 NHL All-Star Game, using infrared technology, and at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. In the past year, the NHL has tested the technology at the 2018 NHL All-Star Game, and will test it again at this weekend's All-Star events. There has also been testing at the New Jersey Devils' arena and Vegas Golden Knights games earlier in January.
Several players in San Jose ahead of Saturday's All-Star Game were unaware that the technology would be tested on them, but others were excited to see how the data collection works.
""It's more analytics for the general managers to hold against you,"" Columbus Blue Jackets forward Cam Atkinson told ESPN, with a laugh. ""But I think it's good for the fans. I've seen some scenarios where it's worked, and it looked pretty cool. You find a lot more information that you never know. I don't know how fast I shoot the puck.""
Other players would rather not know.
""If they don't show mine, that would be great,"" Calgary Flames star Johnny Gaudreau said of his shot speed. ""But for the fans, it's going to be great. They can see how fast we skate, how hard shots are, all of these things.""
Lehanski said that, initially, there was pushback from players on wearable technology.
""I think it's fair to say there was concern in the beginning. They had a ton of questions, like, 'What is this really tracking?'"" he said. ""But over the course of that time, we've made huge strides with them, working closely. A year ago, I wouldn't have thought it would be possible to test tracking technology on players in a regular-season hockey game. The fact that we're on the same page, to me, was a huge step. I think they're starting to understand that it's data. It's about what's already happening on the ice. Maybe some stories might not position things in a way they like, but other stories will.""
One of the reasons this version of puck tracking has been accepted is the pucks themselves. Researchers and engineers at the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany found a way to manufacture the ""smart pucks"" whose weight was in range of the current pucks. They impressed the NHL with other technology related to it.
""For instance, pucks have to be frozen. They basically built a system that nobody else did. There's a little tray, you drop the puck in from the freezer, and it tells you if it's on and how much battery life is left,"" Lehanski said. ""Honestly, it's not even something we thought about it.""
But the players are concerned about any changes with the puck this technology might create.
""I hope it doesn't change the puck at all. I feel like maybe with a tracker in the puck, it could change the feel of it,"" Buffalo Sabres center Jack Eichel said. ""You'd be surprised how close we pay attention to that stuff. The gear isn't as important as the puck. Guys can feel it.""
While all of this data could be applied to everything from television broadcasts to contract negotiations, there's another undeniable aspect: gambling.
The NHL has already cut a licensing deal with MGM Resorts to create wagering options from the league's ""proprietary game data,"" and other deals with bookmakers are sure to follow. A company called Swish Analytics showed off live in-game wagering based on player tracking data in Las Vegas, including prop bets.
With tracking technology, fans could wager on prop bets on individual players.
""Some of them are traditional prop bets, like who will score the next goal. Others are more involved, like what part of the ice the next goal will be scored from or what part of the net it'll be scored in, and which player will skate farther during the game. Will Max Pacioretty skate over 3 miles, for example?"" said Jon Waldman, director of strategic development for the NHL.
The NHL and the NHLPA have a written agreement that includes ""protections"" for players on how the tracking data will be used.
""Typically, the clubs aren't supposed to rely on any of the data we're collecting, in player and puck tracking, in contract negotiations,"" NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said. ""It's not just salary arbitration. It's contract negotiations generally. Citing speed [or other data] and relying on those statistics in negotiations.""
Mathieu Schneider, special assistant to the executive director of the NHLPA, said Friday that there was a split between the veterans and younger players on acceptance of the tracking technology.
Daly said a segment of the players was concerned that contract talks could become too ""stats reliant"" with this data. ""Some players that don't have those attributes, but have other attributes, are concerned about that,"" he said.
But that agreement cuts both ways: Players won't be able to use tracking data to bolster their contract cases, either.
"
25896333,"""Is there anything I miss about him?"" responded defenseman John Carlson, mulling over his answer. ""That's an interesting one.""
It's the same rhetorical reaction one gets from several Capitals, including Alex Ovechkin, when asked about the man who coached them to the Stanley Cup before leaving for the New York Islanders over a contract dispute. It wasn't always sunshine between Trotz and these players, but there was respect.
""From a team perspective, he's been around for a while. Done a lot of great things in his career that we all learned from,"" Carlson said. ""Although from a [defenseman's] perspective, not as much as forwards on the day-to-day stuff. We spent a lot more time with the defense coach than the guy calling the lines. That's just how it breaks down.""
The ""defense coach"" ended up becoming the Capitals' new head coach: Todd Reirden, 47, who had been an assistant coach for Bowling Green University, won the Stanley Cup as an assistant with the Pittsburgh Penguins, was hired in 2014 by Trotz, and won a second Cup last season. He helped run their power play and orchestrated empty-net situations, but mostly he worked with the team's defensemen.

Asking Reirden to praise his predecessor elicits less consternation than when asking his players.
""For the most part, it's gone really smoothly, and that's a credit to Barry,"" Reirden told ESPN. ""He involved all of our coaches, and in particular myself, with the delegating and responsibility. He would look to us for advice in various parts of the game. He often put me in a situation where he'd ask me what I would do if I were the head coach. Those were scenarios that I was [playing] through in my own mind, and it's gotten me ready for right now. I can't thank him enough for doing that.""
Right now, the Capitals are in a funk: 3-5-2 in their past 10 games, having limped to the All-Star break in the midst of a seven-game winless streak. They also lost the lead in the Metro Division in the process -- to Trotz's Islanders, no less. This wasn't a scenario that Reirden could plan for, because this is their longest drought in five years. Hence, general manager Brian MacLellan sees this adversity as a teachable moment for his rookie coach.
""I can tick off all the boxes on his background and experience, but that's a box you can't tick off until you've experienced it. That's something people don't quite understand when it comes to a coach that hasn't had head-coaching experience yet,"" MacLellan said.

Brent Burns and blueliners of his ilk are doing it wrong. Plus, identifying the biggest winner of the Jake Muzzin trade.
But Reirden is learning. When asked what he noticed has changed for Reirden during his first season as bench boss, MacLellan said he's realized whose voice should matter most -- his own. ""In the beginning, he was looking for everyone's opinion. Making sure everyone's voice gets heard, making sure everyone's opinion is heard. But over time, I think he realized that it works better if the decisions aren't done that way,"" he said.
Moving a bit from a democracy to a dictatorship? Or more to the point, from an assistant coach who's a players' guy to being the guy that ticks them off?
""Exactly,"" MacLellan said. ""And I think it's always been like that with assistant coaches that become head coaches. It's just something you learn.""
So has the job changed Todd Reirden?
""I wouldn't categorize it as him being a hard-ass,"" Carlson said, smiling. ""A lot of the stuff that we're doing, the mentality [from last year] is going to stay intact.""
Defenseman Matt Niskanen worked with Reirden in Pittsburgh before they both moved over to the Capitals. ""His personality definitely hasn't changed. It's still the same person who believes in a lot of the same things. But he just has to manage 23 guys now, instead of seven. He has to oversee everything now. He's the leader. It's his voice. It's his team now,"" he said.
""He was really good at being an assistant, a details guy. His real strength was helping individuals get better, and that still brings a little bit of that. He'll take younger players aside and tells them exactly what he wants. And that's what players want today. They want that clarity.""
For example, Carlson was 24 years old when Reirden came on as an assistant coach, and MacLellan believes his influence is what turned the Capitals defenseman into a Norris Trophy contender who earned an eight-year contract extension last summer.

According to Reirden, the key to unlocking Carlson's potential was watching him try, and fail, in battling against Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby.
""Coaching against him was a really important part of knowing the player. I saw him a lot. I was very well aware of the strengths and weaknesses. At the time, John Carlson and Karl Alzner were the go-to guys to play against the Crosbys and the Malkins. In Pittsburgh, we were rolling out some really good offensive players. So I had a pulse on ways I could help improve John, because there were things that I knew he struggled with against our team,"" Reirden recalled. ""I had a plan going forward with him to know what our biggest rival was doing to break down his game. We moved on step one of fixing those deficiencies. Things that maybe he didn't even realize he could do to affect the competition, with how he plays the puck and joins the rush in the zone. It was really a blessing in disguise that I had a chance to coach him so often.""
For the Capitals defensemen he helped develop, having Reirden graduate to head coach was a blessing, too. But Niskanen said the NHL works differently than the NFL, in which coordinators who graduate to head-coaching status might still have a tighter bond with the players they specialized in coaching.
""I didn't see it that way. I mean, I've been with the guy for a long time, so I'm happy he got the opportunity, and I think he's doing a good job for us. I don't think there's going to be a split between the forwards and defense,"" Niskanen said.
It wasn't a worry for MacLellan, either.
""It was never a concern. Yes, he worked with a certain group of guys, but he was always involved in trying to make the team better overall. And his work on the power play, not only here but back in Pittsburgh, means he's learned how to communicate with star players,"" he said.
Reirden said he has strong relationships with many of the players, which has helped him ""turn the page"" from last season to his own regime.
""Barry couldn't have set me up for success better than he did. Nothing has surprised me very much,"" he said.
Well, save for one thing, as the Capitals have seen players such as Evgeny Kuznetsov and T.J. Oshie miss time to injury and Tom Wilson miss time for ... other reasons.
""That's the one thing Barry didn't prepare me for: losing guys to injury and suspension,"" he said with a laugh. ""Last year, we didn't have any of this!""

A few days later, his comments introducing her as a paid guest analyst -- hey, paying a female hockey player for her work at an NHL event, what a concept! -- on NBCSN, made before she covered a Pittsburgh Penguins vs. Tampa Bay Lightning game:
""Tampa's going to be on your left, Pittsburgh's going to be on your right ... we're paying you to be an analyst, not be a fan tonight.""

He followed that with a truly strange line, following Coyne's joke about wearing a face mask when getting into brawls with Team Canada: ""I'll be your cage tonight.""
Huh?
The ""between the benches"" moment blew up globally, to the point where both Coyne and McGuire released statements on Thursday. Just in case you were concerned he couldn't come off any worse, he said ""I should have chosen my words better"" but never actually apologized to Coyne for putting her in this spot.
If you don't understand why this matters, or want to simply write it off because of McGuire's brand of awkwardness or because Coyne said they're friends or because it was some kind of pathetic attempt at a joke about her being a broadcasting novice, just open your ears. Or expand your Twitter feed.

Listen to former women's pro players like Ashley Johnston. who tweeted that it's ""a great example of how far the NHL, broadcast, and sporting world has to go in respecting female athletes and reporters."" Or listen to the women in media who reached out to me privately when this was all going down on Thursday, with one saying: ""It WAS that bad. I used to cover a lot of tennis back in the day and can't ever imagine ANY of the major broadcasters treating a woman like that.""
Understand that this was a professional hockey player for the Minnesota Whitecaps of the NWHL moonlighting on cable television, just like Patrick Sharp would once the Chicago Blackhawks were eliminated from the postseason. The only difference being that no one was bellowing in his face about ""being paid not to be a fan, OK?"" while he was analyzing the game. (Well, OK: Clearly not the only difference...)
Try to understand why so many people felt outrage on her behalf.
And then understand that her lack of it, in reacting to this mess, just makes her all the more inspiring.
What Kendall Coyne Schofield did this week was nothing short of extraordinary, and not just because she skated faster than Clayton Keller at the All-Star Game. This might come as a shock to you, being that this is the league that didn't want John Scott at this silly event a few years ago, but a source told me that there were ""old school"" men in the league office who didn't want Coyne participating in the fastest skater at all. They thought she didn't belong there.
They lost the fight, as they did with Scott, and the same thing happened: an event that usually exists so far off the sports radar that you'd need an orbital telescope to locate it ended up being in the pop culture zeitgeist.
""Obviously I was a little nervous,"" Coyne said afterward. ""But I knew it was a moment that was going to break a lot of barriers and a moment that would change the perception of our game.""
To NBC's credit, they invited her on the air as a guest analyst, capitalizing on her celebrity but also adding a different voice to their homogenous mix.
Then everything happened. This moment was, frankly, stolen from her because of McGuire's oafish comportment.
So what does she do?
Hint: She didn't act like a fan.
She acted like a pro.
Consider her statement. She attempts to rescue McGuire's reputation. She attempts to continue a burgeoning post-playing career as a broadcaster. (Coyne went to Northeastern and has a Bachelor's in communications.) But she doesn't diminish the outrage on her behalf from women who saw, in that exchange, what they've experienced in and around hockey: The reductive language, the ""mansplaining,"" the unwavering notion that they're not seen as an equal.
""I understand why people would think it was inappropriate. If I were watching it at home and saw a man say this to a woman athlete, I would have been offended,"" she said.
In an interview with Katie Strang of The Athletic, Coyne expanded on that:
""I was able to dissect what happened and see it from the viewpoint that the viewers saw it from. I saw how they interpreted it, how they were feeling and they are right,"" Coyne said. ""If that was a former NHL player in my situation, was that what would have been said? Maybe not, but being friends with Pierre and knowing him, I knew how excited he was in that moment.
""However, it doesn't take away from the fact that that language needs to be changed in the future, the way women are perceived in the industry. And I think for all the young girls out there, it shows you need to have confidence in yourself, no matter what the moment is, and I think the takeaway I have from it -- whether it's a moment that someone wants to define for you, you need to define it for yourself. You've worked hard for that moment and that's how I felt.""
After winning the Stanley Cup as an assistant to Barry Trotz, the ""defense coach"" must now pull the Capitals out of a midseason funk.
We grade each team in six areas, identify a class president and student in danger of failing, and issue an overall mark based on preseason expectations.
Brent Burns and blueliners of his ilk are doing it wrong. Plus, identifying the biggest winner of the Jake Muzzin trade.
If there's any lesson to be mined from the smoldering pile of hot takes that have accompanied Coyne's NHL adventure, it's that: Define your moments for yourself.
Like when Coyne and the U.S. women's national team were tired of being defined as second-tier by USA Hockey and fought to be redefined as equals. They threatened to boycott the 2017 IIHF world championships in Michigan until they won their fight for ""fair wages and equitable support"" from their nation's governing hockey body -- and then they won gold over Canada in that tournament.
""It was just a culture where women are an afterthought,"" Coyne told me in 2017. ""We felt the pressure. We knew we had to win. But we had to show USA Hockey that we deserved what we fought for.""
Like in the 2018 Winter Olympics, when Coyne and the USWNT stopped being defined as runner-up to Canada, and redefined themselves as gold medalists. It was something Coyne had chased since she was 7 years old, when U.S. hockey legend Cammi Granato showed her the gold medal she had captured in Nagano. ""If I can give that feeling [of empowerment] to some other kid, that's so special,"" Coyne told Snap Shot.
How did Coyne define herself in the last week? As blazing fast. As a professional women's athlete who showed that her peers should have a place at the men's All-Star weekend. As a paid analyst on an NHL broadcast. As a woman in sports who showed remarkable restraint when faced with inequity and indignity, both in the moment and in the aftermath. As an epitome of grace and class whose focus remained on inspiring the next generation to rush through the barriers she's broken.
""What IS important is for every young girl reading this to know it doesn't matter what anyone thinks of my hockey knowledge because I do not doubt my hockey knowledge,"" she wrote. ""I didn't need a gold medal to come to that conclusion. I needed belief in myself.""
Let the lingering memory of the last week be one of Schofield as an inspiration, moving us all forward. Let it not be the guy vowing to be ""her cage.""
Speaking of the NHL All-Star Weekend sensation, Emily Kaplan and I welcomed Schofield on the podcast to talk about her experiences, as well as Aaron Portzline of The Athletic to chat about the futures of Sergei Bobrovsky and Artemi Panarin.

As mentioned in our Q&A with NHLPA chief Donald Fehr, the earliest possible date for the next World Cup of Hockey is February 2021. That is, if you believe a World Cup could be jammed into that time frame.
The sources I've spoken to on the NHL and the NHLPA sides differ on this.

The players believe there's ample time for a World Cup to be held. Their argument is that if the owners can shutter the league for 16 days during an Olympic break -- as they did for the 2014 Sochi Games -- then they certainly can do the same for a tournament that could have lasted 15 days at most in September 2016. The players wouldn't need a slate of preliminary games because they would have played four months of the NHL schedule. That's also the reason they believe the quality of play might be better this time around than the sub-All-Star level we saw in many 2016 World Cup games. (Team North America excluded.)
Basically, their thinking is: If you were willing to stop the season for a tournament in which no one in the NHL makes money, wouldn't you do the same for a tournament in which everyone gets paid?
(The thinking from the rank and file is also: 'Hey, we really love getting two weeks for vacations midseason while the elite players are at this international whatever...')
That's also the owners' feeling: They're amenable to postpone the All-Star Game and take a midseason break for an international event. The thing is, they don't want to do it for two weeks. They want something smaller scale, like a Ryder Cup. North America vs. The World? Everyone vs. Canada? Old vs. Young? There are many possibilities.
The bottom line is that something on an international scale is going to happen in February 2021 for the NHL. It's just the size of that scale that's the issue.

Really interesting work here from Travis Yost on the need for the NHL to extend the 3-on-3 overtime. ""Ultimately it is up to the NHL and the NHLPA to decide where they want to draw the line in the sand on overtime, but I think that extending 3-on-3 overtime by about four minutes would mean the vast majority of games (close to 90 percent) get resolved prior to the shootout.""
This P.K. Subban appearance on comedian Kevin Hart's ""Cold As Balls"" show is the loosest, funniest and most charismatic he's been in years. It's really, really terrific, and refreshingly ... how to put this ... not calculated, for a change for P.K.

25871331,"NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has repeatedly said the league is ""not looking for a fight."" That's hopeful, considering the league could be on the verge of its fourth work stoppage in Bettman's 25-year tenure. What does the union think?
ESPN sat down with NHLPA executive director Donald Fehr at All-Star Weekend to discuss the tone of negotiations so far, the new player tracking deal, Olympics, the lack of a domestic violence policy and more.
ESPN: The mantra from Gary Bettman has been that the league is not looking for a fight. Are the players looking for a fight?
Donald Fehr: No. Of course the players are not looking for a fight. The players' view is what it always has been. And what I expressed in the last go-around ad nauseam, is that from the players' standpoint a work stoppage is the last resort you come to. You only do it when that's a better option than the agreements that are on the table. That hasn't been the management practice in a number of sports in the last 35 or 40 years. But hopefully this time will be different. We'll see.
Using a five-category grading system, we determine the teams that are playing must-watch hockey in 2018-19 -- and those you should skip.
From a memorable skills competition Friday night to Saturday night's games, we break down the good, the bad and the Gritty.
We identify the top rentals at all positions and players with term remaining. Plus, a few long-shot wild cards for good measure.
ESPN: We've also heard that in your meetings so far, there has been a lack of tension, which is noticeably different in tone from previous negotiations. Would you agree with that assessment?
Fehr: Yes. Although ... a win or a loss counts just as much in Game 10 of the season as it does in Game 75. But the tension level might be a bit different. We're closer to Game 10.
ESPN: Escrow is one of the big issues. Bill Daly has mentioned before that there could be some adjustment to the cap that could be done to ease escrow for the players. Is that something the PA is looking at?
Fehr: Obviously escrow is a real problem. We believe that what the teams offer players is a closer measure of their worth. And what the teams offer players [is] less escrow. And that ought to be accounted for. There are obviously a number of things you can do to address it, and I'm sure we'll be talking about it.
ESPN: When we talk to players about the most important issues to them in the next CBA, we usually hear two answers: escrow and the Olympics. Are you confident that an Olympic solution can be achieved in the next CBA?
Fehr: I would like to believe that as far as between us and the NHL, that will not turn out to be a difficult issue. We have a shared desire, if we can figure out how to do it -- and getting from here to there is harder than saying you want to go there -- to develop a long-range international calendar. It's very difficult for me to imagine that would be done without including the Olympics. The reason I said ""between us and the NHL"" is that we still have to have negotiations with the IOC.
ESPN: So the next potential date for an event is February 2021?
Fehr: February 2021 is the next possible date for the World Cup, yes.
ESPN: When we talk about that potentially being on the table, would the PA only agree if there is a calendar attached to that?
Fehr: There is a generalized tendency to say, 'We're now talking about the international, so we're going to make an agreement on international, this is going to trade for that, you have to have this, and the rest of it."" It doesn't work that way. You're looking at an overall agreement. Since we both would like a long-term calendar, I would like to think that will, in part, be a central part of it. Could you do it without it in theory? Sure, in 2016 we did it without it in theory.
It's not the best, because you want to schedule the events, you want to interest the advertisers, you want to build the brand, you want to have a regular recurring event for the fans, you want to do all those kinds of things. So that takes more long-term planning than what we've had a chance to do.
ESPN: It seemed like missing the 2018 Olympics really set things back for the players. Because there was a level of anger on that issue that is palpable. Do you agree?
Fehr: I'll let you make that judgment about anger. But look, whether other people would agree with it or not, or if observers would agree, participation in the Olympics is a meaningful thing for a whole lot of players. The Canadians, particularly so, and for Europeans. Most players look at it and say ""OK, the Olympics are coming up, this is either my only chance or maybe my last chance. Because in four years who knows if I'm going to be good enough, if I'm going to be healthy enough, if there's going to be three other young kids who are going to take my place.""
So it tended to be viewed as not something we can do again another time, but as an opportunity permanently lost for what a lot of players thought was no good reason. I don't want to get into anger. But if you ask the question differently, do they have memories? The answer is yes.

ESPN: The NHL is the only of the four North American major professional sports leagues without a domestic violence policy. Do you believe there needs to be one?
Fehr: It depends on what you mean by that. Two things, you could say here we have a domestic violence policy, and we're going to label these things domestic violence and these other things not, and we're going to have hard and fast rules. Or you can say -- and this is what the NHL has done -- if we have inappropriate conduct, wrongful conduct, whether it's domestic violence or it's not, we can evaluate each case on its own merits and then make a judgment as to what needs to be done and third parties can make the judgment as to whether we acted appropriately. That's normally the way discipline works.
So when you say policy, you're talking about some sort of mandatory pre-judged disciplinary proceedings or something like that, as opposed to, do they get the training, do they talk to the people, all the rest of it?
ESPN: Yes.
Fehr: I am old-school. I think we ought to be bright enough to recognize conduct whether or not [there is a written policy]. Now, if over time, you would get a number of matters develop, and you could say, look, you don't have a formal policy and it's actually getting in the way of what you want to do, then you would re-examine it. But I don't think we're there yet. And I think we're lucky enough that the numbers of incidents that we have had are tiny.
ESPN: Do you believe the commissioner has been fair in the discipline he has given out for those incidents?
Fehr: I don't talk about the individual cases. The players have a right to appeal. Everybody ought to have a right to appeal under those circumstances. I will tell you that the discipline, especially in the last case [Predators forward Austin Watson], even after the arbitrator ruled, was very severe. Eighteen games is a long time.
ESPN: Are you worried at all the NHL is going to come after the appeals process because of some of the recent losses it has taken?
Fehr: Do I know whether they are going to come after it? No. Am I bothered by it? No. Do I expect the players would agree to it? Probably not.
ESPN: It's interesting that players agreed not to have any data found from player tracking used in contract negotiations. I would think some data for non-star players -- third-liners, fourth-liners -- could help their cases in these situations. So what was the thinking there?
Fehr: You have to answer this. There are some people that are concerned about making additional information available. Sometimes you hear from people who would say, look, I know what my job is, and if I'm a half second slower than I was two years ago, as long as I'm there when I'm supposed to be, what's the difference? There may be other players who may well have the reaction you do. The critical thing here is, we didn't have agreement on everything, but we got agreements officially to do the experiments and see how it works. Then we'll see what the data is, we'll see if it's helpful in other licensing agreements, we'll see if the broadcasters like it, and we'll see the rest of it.
Then the players, along with their agents and everybody else, can look at it and say in that particular respect, does this make any sense? Should it be tweaked? Should it be reversed? This is short term. These are baby steps.

ESPN: I understand the players have agreed to license their names as part of that.
Fehr: Again, short term. Nobody knows what this is going to be. Everyone is trying to sort through what it's going to mean. If you ask 10 people what the future stakes of this is going to be in five or 10 years, somebody is going to be right. Because you're going to get an answer from A to Z over 10 people. Nobody really knows. You have to try it and see what it does, what revenue it produces, and see if it has any effects going the other way. All of this is baby steps and experimental, I think.
The notion -- and I think the NHL shares our view on this -- that we feel confident enough to predict what everyone is going to do, and how this is all going to work out, strikes me as something I wouldn't bet on. It's too new.
ESPN: When it comes to medical coverage or benefits for former players, is that something you feel can be achieved in the next CBA?
Fehr: It's something that I'm sure will be explored in some fashion.
ESPN: There has been talk of the league trying to reduce the length of a max contract. Is that something you are concerned about?
Fehr: Concern was on the table in the last agreement, the last go-around. I am of the view that you pretty much ought to leave players and teams alone. Sometimes, depending on your perspective, they'll make good deals and sometimes they'll make bad deals. Sometimes they make deals which are longer and shorter because it structures the financial aspect of it in a certain way. I don't know why you'd want to limit that flexibility.
From a players' standpoint, any time you shorten maximum length of contract, what you do is shorten the`available security a player can get. I suspect you can figure out what their reaction to that would be. But, an agreement is everything that is on the table or people talk about. You really can't isolate them. Would you agree that we're going to play four 20-minute periods? The answer to that is no. What if I pay everybody $10 million a year more, well, maybe I need to think about it then. So we'll see.

25852577,"Speaking before the NHL All-Star Game, leaders from both sides expressed optimism they can avoid another work stoppage.
Bettman categorized the discussions so far as ""cordial and constructive, even though they are preliminary.""
His counterparts with the union echoed that.
""The thing that stands out to me the most is we're able to have these discussions with a lack of tension,"" said Mathieu Schneider, the NHLPA's special assistant to the executive director. ""When you start bargaining meetings like we did in 2012 ... You could cut the tension with a knife in those first couple meetings, and in most meetings. And we're able to have these discussions now without that tension, without walls being built up, and it's been very positive so far.""
As it stands, the current CBA lasts through the 2021-22 season. In September 2019, both sides can notify the other side of its intention to opt out.
The NHL has been locked out on three separate occasions over Bettman's 25-year tenure as commissioner. Among the core issues for players in negotiations is the ability to go to the Olympics -- the NHL did not send players to the 2018 Games in South Korea for the first time in two decades -- as well as negating or minimizing escrow.
""We're exploring the possibility of whether we can bridge gaps; the earlier the better,"" NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said. ""We obviously understand the difficulties we've had in the past. Both parties have acknowledged that. The fact that we're sitting down and having constructive dialogue on open issues at an early date is very positive.""
Daly said there's been no discussion of the Olympic issue in talks with the NHLPA so far, other than citing that the players want to go and the owners do not want to.
There has been a belief that the onus falls on the players in these negotiations, since the owners are pleased with what they have seen in the current agreement. League revenue has soared to $4.85 billion (for context, it was $400 million when Bettman first started).
The owners also got a more favorable split of hockey-related revenue in the last CBA.
""There's no question the players have given back billions of dollars over the course of the past two negotiations,"" Schneider said. ""That's no secret. I don't think I'd characterize it as the ball is in the players' hands.""

25832551,"One problem: The Hurricanes forgot to plan one.
Captain Justin Williams said the team brainstorms these celebration ideas during the week, and they're pitched to him, like the NHL's version of Lorne Michaels mulling sketch suggestions from his cast members. ""I tell them to bring them in to me. There's no idea too stupid. But you don't want to be too corny,"" he told ESPN recently.
So, absent a planned celebration, defenseman Jaccob Slavin offered an alternative. ""Let's just do the bowling thing,"" he said, referencing an idea that had come up before.
The Hurricanes began leading the crowd with rhythmic clapping, forming a triangle at center ice. Williams skated across the blue line, turned, took off his helmet and ... bowled a strike.

It was a moment of shambolic joy, in keeping with the overall theme of this Hurricanes season. They're messy, they're unpredictable, they're somehow both impressive and disappointing, sometimes in the same period. Yet through 49 games, they're six points in back of the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference heading into Wednesday's game against Vancouver (10:30 p.m. ET on ESPN+), which wasn't something that looked likely during a 3-8-2 stretch back in December.
""Lately, there's been a little bit more of an awakening. Quite honestly, from where we were a couple of weeks ago ... we're hockey players. We're proud guys. It was embarrassing where we were at,"" Williams said. ""With the talent we have, and the position that we felt we should be in, it wasn't close to where we were. And we're not quite there yet. But we're trending in the right direction. We're not going backwards. We're going forward.""
Every season, it seems like there's an anchor that holds the Hurricanes back from lurching forward -- they have failed to make the postseason since 2009. Usually it was goaltending; this season, it's their offense, which ranks 27th, at 2.73 goals per game, and features an embarrassingly low 7.6 shooting percentage, the lowest in the NHL.
First-year coach Rod Brind'Amour said it's a ""tough one"" when asked about his team's offense.
""I got frustrated with it,"" he said. ""People said we just shot the puck from wherever. What they should have done is dug in more and looked at the grade-A chances. Because that's what we track. We don't track shots on goal. We track chances for and chances against. We were way higher earlier in the year, us vs. them. Now it's leveled off and we're scoring more.""
But the number of impact players offensively remains limited.
We identify the top rentals at all positions and players with term remaining. Plus, a few long-shot wild cards for good measure.
The Islanders goalie has been a great story throughout the season, but has been particularly stellar recently.
From building a staff to creating a farm team, to engineering an epic arena build and finding the right team name, here's the latest from the ground.
""When you look at our group overall, I don't think we're the most talented group. I think everyone would agree on that,"" Brind'Amour said. ""We have a couple of really nice players, and then we have 'the rest.' And maybe 'the rest' need a few more shots to put the puck in the net. That's how we knew we were going to be built. I don't think we anticipated the first 25 games would be that low. But now our last six or seven games, all of a sudden it's leveling out. And you're like, 'This is what should have happened early in the year.'""
Brind'Amour replaced Bill Peters last summer after Peters opted to leave the Hurricanes to give new owner Tom Dundon and general manager Don Waddell a chance to ""get their own guy"" as coach. ""Roddy's a good man. He's as good as they come,"" Peters said on Wednesday. ""He's been in that organization for a long time, and he's worked his way up. It'll be good. They've got a good young team there.
There's a lot Brind'Amour couldn't anticipate in his first season behind the bench. Like losing dependable veteran center Jordan Staal to injury, limiting him to 29 games. Or having center Victor Rask score one goal in 26 games after returning from injury, before he was shipped out to Minnesota for Nino Niederreiter. Or that defenseman Dougie Hamilton, a prized acquisition in the summer from the Calgary Flames, would struggle to find his game.
""I have to figure out how to get more out of him, because it's all there,"" said Brind'Amour of Hamilton. ""He's the total package. What's tough on our team is that our team is very deep at that position. It's not great for him, but it's great for us. He puts a lot of shots at the net, but in years past those went in.""
One thing he did anticipate was the progression of rookie Andrei Svechnikov, the 18-year-old No. 2 overall pick in last summer's draft. He has 12 goals and 10 assists in 49 games. While his lofty status might have had some assuming more offensive dominance, his coach wasn't willing to overestimate his rookie potential.
""Love the kid. It's the perfect storm: He works hard, and he wants to get better. Sometimes he works too hard. He puts a lot of pressure on himself. He thinks he should be scoring 30 goals, and it's not that easy,"" Brind'Amour said. ""The hard part for him is that he's never been taught how to play defense, because every team he's ever been on he's had the puck. They didn't worry about him messing up. It's not like that in the NHL. He's had to learn on the fly as an 18-year-old, and that's tough.""
But there have been pleasant surprises, too. Sebastian Aho, 21, has not only blossomed into a star but has also become the top-line center the team has long coveted.
""We knew right away he was a competitor,"" Brind'Amour said. ""Now, I didn't think he was going to take off as he has, but from the moment we first saw him, I knew he wanted to win. And last year I saw it: He hated losing more than he likes winning. And that's the kind of people you want. Winning is supposed to happen. Losing isn't.""
It's a mentality Aho shares with his coach, who was a ferocious competitor during his NHL career. Conveying that message to the locker room is Brind'Amour's consigliere Justin Williams, whom he playfully refers to as ""our old guy"" in the room.
""I'm very familiar with Rod, and he's very familiar with me. We haven't been together as player and coach for a long time, but we've known each other for a long time,"" said Williams, 37. ""As a captain, you have to convey the messages that the coach is sending, and convey them throughout the team. You have to make sure everyone is on board with it, because if someone is off board, then the train isn't running smoothly.""
Postgame analysis and highlight show airing each night throughout the season from Barry Melrose and Linda Cohn. Watch on ESPN+
Where this train is headed is anyone's guess, but Williams feels the momentum has turned in the Hurricanes' favor.
""I feel earlier in the season that we were getting really bad puck luck,"" he said. ""I'm one of those old-school guys that feels that you make your own puck luck, but there is something to be said about having bad puck luck. But now we're getting a little bit more of what we deserved earlier in the season.
More puck luck means more goals. More goals mean more wins. More wins mean more of those celebrations that enchant the fans and tick off the hockey establishment ... although Williams agreed that the ""Storm Surge"" might not have flown back in 2000 when he started in the NHL with the Philadelphia Flyers.
""I think you evolve in everything you do. Is this something that would have happened 18 years ago when I broke into the league? Probably not. But with all the young players in the league, and more fan engagement, and more social media, it just seems like the next step to go,"" he said. ""People either like it or they don't. And that's fine. We certainly don't see anything wrong with it.""
Brind'Amour said he hasn't received any negative feedback from friends or peers about the Storm Surge. ""I don't have a favorite one. But my young guy ... this is what people don't talk about with [the celebrations]: The young fans, at least in Raleigh, they're loving this. And they're taking it into their games. And that's what you want to do: Build the next generation of hockey fans,"" he said.
Plus, it looks like fun.
Brind'Amour offers a correction. ""The fun factor comes with winning,"" he said. ""You can have fun in Siberia when you're winning.""

25883523,"In the recent past, we've used this space to look at things like the best lines in hockey, the many advantages of riding shotgun alongside a true superstar and the effects of the Barry Trotz defensive system. This week, we're going to focus in on defensemen by taking a look at the pros and cons of shooting the puck from the point, and the winners and losers of the Jake Muzzin trade. Any data referenced is mined from either Corsica or Natural Stat Trick.
When Duncan Keith's slap shot from the top of the left circle snuck past Casey DeSmith for a goal during a game against the Penguins a couple of weeks ago, it was a seemingly innocuous moment for the veteran Blackhawks defenseman.
The All-Star Game gave us a glimpse. But like any new technology, it's still being tweaked. Here's what happens before full launch in 2019-20.
Toronto landed a first-pairing defenseman in Jake Muzzin, but it cost the Maple Leafs two prospects and a first-rounder. We grade both GMs on the swap.
From a memorable skills competition Friday night to Saturday night's games, we break down the good, the bad and the Gritty.
With Keith now in the final chapters of a career that's been littered with epic triumphs and accolades -- mostly notably including two Norris Trophies, a Conn Smythe Trophy, three Stanley Cup rings and well north of 1,000 games played -- it's quite understandable that a random goal in the middle of an otherwise completely forgettable season wouldn't really register on his list of accomplishments. The thing is: these days, it does.
Though lighting the lamp isn't a particularly common occurrence nor is it a necessary part of the job description for any defenseman, Keith's struggles shooting the puck are now reaching a whole new level. During the past two seasons, he's scored a grand total of three times in 133 games. If you stretch back to the 2016-17 campaign, that mark becomes three in 146.
What makes it particularly wild is that his scoring struggles haven't been for a lack of trying, because his volume of attempts and opportunities are staggering. In that period of time, he's played just south of 3,100 minutes, attempted 580 shots, 366 of which got past a shot blocker and 307 of which made their way onto net. He was eventually supplanted by Erik Gustafsson on the top power-play unit this season, but he's been on the ice for nearly 300 minutes with the man advantage during that stretch.
That means that less than 1 percent of Keith's shots on target have turned into goals, and 99.5 percent of his attempts have either been stopped or missed the target. Even if you factor in that the occasional puck coming off of his stick has resulted in a rebound or tip that eventually led to something, opposing teams must be breathing a sigh of relief every time he winds up for a shot. He's fundamentally been a black hole offensively, where scoring chances have gone to die.
Though Keith is an easy target here because of how particularly egregious he's been in this regard, the reality is that he's hardly alone. Whether it's because of lesser puck skills compared to forwards generally, or whether it's simply a reflection of how difficult it is to beat NHL goalies from that far out, defensemen have proven to be largely inefficient shooters compared to their forward counterparts. Here's how the two have stacked up against each other since the start of last season:
We don't typically discuss Xs and Os from this perspective in hockey the way we do in a sport like basketball, but the idea of catering your approach in the attacking zone around limiting wasted possessions and striving to optimize opportunities is an interesting one that perhaps deserves more consideration.
We've typically equated high shot totals as a good thing regardless of where they're coming from, because it shows that you have possession of the puck more often than not. But it's not quite that simple.
Greg Wyshynski and Emily Kaplan have plenty to talk about following their coverage of All Star Weekend. Two-time Olympic medalist Kendall Coyne talked to Emily about her historic participation in the All-Star Skills Competition (12:08).  The Athletic's Aaron Portzline talks about Artemi Panarin's decision to not sign an extension with Columbus prior to the trade deadline (36:33). Listen »
NHL goalies these days are so good that you're generally not beating them on a consistent basis unless you're either getting the puck moving from east to west through the royal road, or funneling it into the prime real estate in the middle of the ice. That's especially true on the power play, where we've already seen many teams adopt the four-forward, one-defenseman approach to increase their chances of scoring. With the additional time and space that's afforded to teams with the extra man, drawing up a power-play strategy in 2019 that revolves around settling for shots from the point feels like it's almost letting the penalty kill off the hook.
With the chasm between forwards and defensemen being as massive as it is when it comes to turning shots into goals, this raises some important philosophical questions. Should defensemen be more selective with the puck, focusing less on shooting it themselves and more on patiently waiting for something better to materialize? And should we as fans and analysts in turn be adjusting the way we look at that paradigm, and the way we discuss those very shot figures?
For all the credit a player like Brent Burns receives for his ridiculous individual numbers, it seems fair to wonder whether him eating up as big a chunk of the shot share pie as he does is actually the best thing for the San Jose Sharks as a team. He's clearly a unique specimen who possesses a wider range of offensive weapons than your typical defenseman, and yet he still poses a lesser threat as a shooter than a league-average forward.
Burns has soaked up a whopping 28.6 percent of his team's total attempts when he's been on the ice this season, which is a league high for defenders. The issue is that only 2.04 percent of these attempts actually wind up in the back of the net. It's great that his nifty, quick release allows him to get the puck through traffic effectively, but the area the shots are predominantly coming from is ultimately something opposing defenses can live with -- especially if it means forgoing a potential look for Timo Meier, Tomas Hertl or Joe Pavelski from a much more dangerous scoring region.
This is something to think about the next time you're watching a game and you hear the fans of the home team impatiently pleading for them to settle for shooting the puck from the point when they have their opponent pinned in the offensive zone.
While we're on the topic of defensemen, let's unpack Monday evening's trade between the Kings and the Maple Leafs.
The Kings, if it somehow wasn't clear already, are in the early stages of a full rebuild. After Vegas skated laps around them in a first-round sweep last postseason, things have completely unraveled this season. They're ahead of only the Senators in the standings in terms of point percentage, and no one has a worse goal differential. The bigger issue is that there doesn't appear to be a quick fix, because they'll now be paying the tax for winning multiple Stanley Cups with all of the loyalty contracts they've signed to core players from that era. Their current cap situation is unfathomably bad, and only a combination of patience, luck and a life raft in the form of potential compliance buyouts in the new CBA will help them dig out of the hole they find themselves in for the foreseeable future.

This move was an unpleasant one, but it was ultimately a necessary one for them. They don't get a single sure thing back -- even the first-round pick will likely be in the back half of the 20s, which is tantamount to a second-rounder -- but what they do get is a nice combination of lottery tickets. They've done a solid job of accumulating intriguing young talent in recent drafts, having added high-upside forwards like Gabriel Vilardi, Rasmus Kupari, Akil Thomas and Bulat Shafigullin into their system. The likes of Carl Grundstrom and Sean Durzi only bolster that system, as does the draft pick, regardless of how low it may fall. They don't have too many other particularly intriguing assets to dangle in the faces of contenders, but at this point, essentially everyone on their roster should be available between now and the Feb. 25 deadline.
For the Leafs, the motivation behind the move is equally obvious. Their sights are firmly set on the postseason, where they'll most likely need to finally get past the Bruins in round one, before finding a way to corral a Lightning team that possesses arguably the most lethal offensive attack we've ever seen. It's an unenviable task, but it's also one that this current roster is good enough to legitimately strive toward.
At 30 years old, Muzzin is not the same caliber of player he was a couple of seasons ago when he was seemingly on everyone's list of most underrated players in the league, but he's a logical trade target for the Leafs for a number of reasons. They didn't need to give up any of their premium young assets to acquire him, like they might have had to do for some other comparable defensemen; and he's not a pure rental because he's still under contract for another season beyond this one. With just a $4 million cap hit next season, he'll be a valuable asset for a team that'll once again be expected to compete, especially as a potential Jake Gardiner replacement.
Most importantly, he represents a clear upgrade over what the Leafs currently have on the blue line. Not only does he help shore up their most obvious need, but he helps bump soon-to-be 38-year-old Ron Hainsey off the top pairing and down to a place on the depth chart that's more compatible for this stage of his career.
The biggest winner from this trade might actually be Muzzin's new partner, Morgan Rielly, who has rarely had the luxury of playing alongside a player whom he didn't have to carry. All things considered, it's remarkable that Rielly has had the success that he has had early in his career -- vaulting all the way up to Norris Trophy discussions this season -- because the list of regular defense partners with whom he's played is littered with replacement-level talent. Count how many of the following are now either retired or out of the league largely because they're not good enough to stick around. There's a legitimate case to be made that Muzzin is instantly the best of the bunch, and if he's not, then he's not far behind:
It'll be fascinating to see not only how Rielly does with a shiny new toy, but how Muzzin does now that's been freed from a dire situation and inserted directly into a playoff race. Considering how well Muzzin has performed over the years playing with Drew Doughty, there's no reason to believe that he won't thrive alongside Rielly. Stylistically, the two are very similar in terms of how they play and what they want to accomplish whenever they're on the ice.
Overall, it's awfully hard to quibble with this move from Toronto's perspective. They Leafs are better today than they were a few days ago, adding a true top-four defenseman without having to subtract anything from their main roster. Whether that will ultimately be enough to get them over the hump in the postseason is an entirely different question, but at least they're now better suited to compete in the Atlantic Division arms race.

Alex Ovechkin takes a picture of sad, last-picked Phil Kessel at the 2011 NHL Fantasy Draft. Now, this could have been a spot to honor Ovechkin's prop comedy skills, competition goals or even old-school Capitals such as Mike Gartner and Peter Bondra (fastest skater) or Al Iafrate (hardest shot) winning their skills competitions. But Ovechkin's ""mockery"" of the last pick started the Phil Kessel Redemption Society and exposed the cruel underbelly of the fantasy draft format that we all loved but the players loathed.

Rick Nash scores 12 seconds into the 2008 NHL All-Star Game. It remains the fastest goal from both the start of a game and the start of a period in NHL All-Star Game history. Runner up: the 29 times we heard the cannon fire in Columbus for the 2015 All-Star Game.

Alexei Kovalev wins the MVP at Bell Centre. The Canadiens' offensive dynamo had a heck of an entertaining week, playing the puck off his head in the breakaway challenge, scoring two goals and an assist in the All-Star Game and scoring one more in the shootout to lead his team to victory. He was voted in by the fans and vowed to wow them as team captain. For winning MVP, he won a car.

Jamie Benn gets accurate. The Stars winger won the 2012 shot accuracy competition in 10.204 seconds, which remains the second-fastest time since the format of the event was changed in 2011.

Marian Gaborik wins fastest skater in 2003. Once called a ""Maserati on the Autobahn"" by Sports Illustrated, the Wild winger won the speedskating event at the All-Star Game in Sunrise, Florida. He later won All-Star Game MVP in 2012 as a member of the Rangers. Honorable mention: defenseman Filip Kuba getting the only All-Star Game selection of his career (333 points in 836 games) because the Wild hosted the 2004 event.

Joe Sakic wins 2004 All-Star MVP. The Hall of Fame center won most valuable player in a losing effort, scoring three of the Western Conference's four goals for an All-Star Game hat trick. (For the record, please note that these All-Star jerseys were incredible.)
Previous ranking: 15
Zemgus Girgensons makes the 2015 All-Star Game. Before there was John Scott, there was Zemgus Girgensons, the Buffalo forward who to this date has yet to score more than 30 points in a season. But the NHL's online voting allowed fans in his native home of Latvia to flood the NHL's poll and power the 21-year-old forward into the game as a starter.

The debut of The Guardian Project. Yes, the ill-conceived (RIP, Stan Lee) NHL comic book crossover made its infamous debut at the Raleigh All-Star Game in 2011. And the world was never the same. I mean, until the Guardian Project disappeared from the NHL's marketing plans about a year later. Then it was pretty much the same.
It was only 7 yrs ago when one of the NHL's biggest embarrassments in their history - The Guardian Project flopped miserably at the NHL All-Star Game. Seems like the League is trying to outdo itself here with #KidRock. Check this out for a laugh - https://t.co/6s7mFgHA7X

Daniel Sedin's shot accuracy in 2011. The Canucks star sniped four targets on four shots in 7.3 seconds to set a still-standing All-Star record. By comparison, current Canuck Brock Boeser won last season's shot accuracy challenge in 11.136 seconds.

Mike Liut proves there can be goaltending in an All-Star Game. The Blues netminder stopped 25 shots in 31 minutes, which included 18 shots in the first period by a Wales Conference team that featured the host Los Angeles Kings' entire Triple Crown line. He won the MVP award, one of only five goalies to ever win it. It earned him a new Toyota Celica Supra!

Wayne Gretzky scores four goals in a period in 1983. The game, held at the Nassau Coliseum, saw the Campbell Conference lead the Wales by one goal headed into the third period. The Campbell team won 9-3, thanks to Gretzky's All-Star-Game-record four goals in the third, three of which were assisted by Mark Messier. The flurry helped Gretzky win his first of three All-Star MVPs.
Previous ranking: 22
Teemu Selanne wins 1998 All-Star MVP. The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim star was playing for Team World in that game's format. He won the Puck Control Relay in the Skills Competition and then tallied a hat trick in the All-Star Game to become the first European-born MVP and the first MVP from a losing team since Grant Fuhr in 1986.
Previous ranking: 24
The nice answer is Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick tying shot-accuracy legend Ray Bourque in the 1999 skills competition in Tampa. The real answer, of course, is that the Coyotes were to host the 2006 All-Star Game, but it was scuttled due to the Olympic break, and then the Coyotes were passed over in subsequent attempts to reacquire the game. Sigh.

The Gretzky Farewell tour. New York Rangers legend Wayne Gretzky was the star of the 1999 (naturally) All-Star Game, helping Team Canada ... uh, ""North America"" defeat the World stars 8-6. Gretzky, in his final All-Star Game, had a goal and two assists (including one on Rob Blake's game winner) to capture MVP honors.
Previous ranking: 26
Pavel Bure wins MVP. The 2000 NHL All-Star Game in Toronto was a pretty memorable one for the Panthers, what with Viktor Kozlov tying Ray Bourque in shot accuracy and Bure scoring a hat trick to lead the World All-Stars to their first win over the North Americans. The Bure brothers combined for six points, becoming the first brothers to score points in the same game since Maurice and Henri Richard in 1956.

Patrick Kane wins the Breakaway Challenge as Superman. Marian Hossa strapped on the cape. Kane put on the Clark Kent glasses. (Not canon, but whatever). On his breakaway attempt, he dove to the ice on his stomach and passed the puck with his glove to his stick for an inventive goal that was good enough to win the title.

Wayne Simmonds scores the game winner, takes MVP. In 2017, Simmonds returned to his first NHL home, Los Angeles, to compete in his first All-Star Game. He scored the definitive goal in the 3-on-3 tournament final for the Metro Division -- with 4 minutes, 48 seconds left -- to become the first Flyer to win MVP since Reggie Leach in 1980. He also scored two goals in the semifinal. He won a Honda Ridgeline. ""No clue what I'm going to do with [the truck]. Maybe somebody -- my mom, dad, brothers or somebody -- needs a car or something like that. I don't need it. It's a nice luxury to have, but who knows what I'll do with it,"" he told Philly.com.

Brian Boyle makes the All-Star Game. Boyle's heartwarming comeback in 2017-18 from chronic myeloid leukemia that led him all the way to the All-Star Game in Tampa (as Taylor Hall's injury replacement) became perhaps the story of the event. ""I'm very thankful. I always have been. I've never taken it for granted to play in this league. To be here and to see all these stars, the guys, how humble they are and then how supportive they've been for me throughout the year and even today, it's been wild. It really is,"" he said.

Wayne Gretzky wins MVP ... in Edmonton. Gretzky, traded to the Kings in 1988, returned to Edmonton for the All-Star Game in only his second appearance there with the opposition. He skated on a line with Jari Kurri. He was warmly greeted by the fans. He won the MVP award with a goal and two assists in the Campbell Conference's 9-5 win, getting a car as a reward, which he gifted to former Oilers teammate (and bodyguard) Dave Semenko, who had just retired.

Gordie Howe gets into a fight at the All-Star Game. Way back in 1948, in the second NHL All-Star event, Howe was a member of the team of stars who took on the defending Stanley Cup champion Maple Leafs, which was the initial format for the game. At Chicago Stadium in 1948, Gordie Howe and Gus Mortson of the Leafs got into an actual fight in the All-Star Game that was so nasty that the two were held under police guard until their penalties were over. Old-time hockey!

Team Alfredsson at the 2012 All-Star Game. The most popular player in franchise history was given his own fantasy team captaincy in an event that served as a 20th-anniversary celebration of the return of the franchise. His fantasy team captain opponent? Former Senator Zdeno Chara. Completing the Sens celebration: Fans voted three other Ottawa players into the starting lineup in Erik Karlsson, Jason Spezza and Milan Michalek.

25860649,"Crosby had two goals and three assists to win the All-Star MVP, and Henrik Lundqvist pitched a first-half shutout to lead the Metropolitan Division to a 10-5 victory over the Central Division in the championship round of the NHL All-Star Game on Saturday night.
Crosby finished the night with four goals and four assists in two games on the same ice where he won the Conn Smythe Trophy and Stanley Cup three years ago for Pittsburgh.
U.S. women's national team player Brianna Decker will be paid $25,000 by CCM after she appeared to post the best time in the premier passing drill at the NHL All-Star skills event on Friday night.
""I have some great memories here for sure,'' he said. ""It's always been a tough place to play. Obviously, when you win in a rink and have those memories, it's something you think about every time you go there. Being in that dressing room, it's automatic to bring you back to some of those moments.''
The memories aren't nearly as sweet for the Sharks fans, who booed Crosby when he won the award, joining Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Bobby Orr, Joe Sakic and Jean Beliveau as the only players to win the Conn Smythe, the Hart Trophy and All-Star MVP.
""It's cool,'' Crosby said. ""You play, and you watch as a kid growing up, and you see that presentation, so it's pretty cool. I had a lot of fun today.''
Lundqvist stopped 11 of 13 shots in his two games to give the Metropolitan Division its second title in four years of the 3-on-3 All-Star format and the $1 million prize shared by the winners of the four-team divisional tournament.
Mathew Barzal of the New York Islanders added two goals and three assists in the final game.
Mikko Rantanen had two goals, and Colorado teammate Gabriel Landeskog added one for the Central. Landeskog finished with four goals and three assists, while Rantanen had four goals and two assists.
""There's more pace, obviously, when it's the final and there's a million dollars on the line. A lot of guys were going a little bit harder, but it's good for the fans,'' Rantanen said. ""Just too bad that we were not that ready to play.''
Crosby assisted on Barzal's goal against Devan Dubnyk just 22 seconds into the championship game and then made it 5-0 in the closing seconds of the first half off a pass from Barzal. Crosby also assisted on Pittsburgh teammate Kris Letang's goal in the first half and then helped seal the game with a goal in the second half that made it 6-2.
Lundqvist made big saves against Landeskog and Claude Giroux in the period one night after winning the save streak competition in the skills challenge.
""It was good defense, good structure,'' Lundqvist said. ""That helps, especially 3-on-3. Honestly, I thought we had pretty good structure, so much skill up front, so many goals. You don't get surprised; you get impressed.''
The first time the All-Star Game came to San Jose in 1997, hometown favorite Owen Nolan capped the night by calling his shot and pointing to the spot where he completed a hat trick that delighted the Shark Tank.
Sharks fans didn't have as much to cheer for in the return, even though their three All-Stars started the night on the ice together for the Pacific. The Central blitzed the Pacific early for its first win in four years in this format, scoring seven goals on nine shots against John Gibson in the first half of the period in a 10-4 victory.
Gibson, who plays for the rival Anaheim Ducks, drew derisive chants from the fans who later called for Vegas' Marc-Andre Fleury to take over.
""Anytime you play it's a rivalry, and the fans take it personally. That's what makes it fun,'' Gibson said. ""You're still at [the] All-Star Game and you're out there with some of the best players in the league. Stuff's going to happen.''
Landeskog had a hat trick and an assist, and Roman Josi had three assists and a goal for the Central.
Pekka Rinne and Dubnyk combined to stop 23 of 27 shots, with Dubnyk providing one of the biggest highlights with a glove save that robbed Connor McDavid on a breakaway.
The Metropolitan Division won the second semifinal 7-4 thanks to a tiebreaking goal by Letang with 3:38 to play. Sebastian Aho added an insurance goal seconds after Braden Holtby stopped John Tavares in close.

25879869,"The suspension is ""related exclusively to his ongoing issues with alcohol abuse,"" the statement said. The suspension is without pay and will be in effect until the forward is cleared for on-ice competition by the program administrators.
The NHLPA executive director says the players ""are not looking for a fight,"" and checks in on various other topics.
Using a five-category grading system, we determine the teams that are playing must-watch hockey in 2018-19 -- and those you should skip.
Watson had been suspended for the preseason and the first 18 games of the regular season after pleading no contest to domestic abuse this summer.
Watson, 27, was arrested in Tennessee at a gas station in June and charged with domestic assault against his girlfriend.
Two weeks ago, in an Instagram post, he talked about his struggles with alcoholism, depression and anxiety, and said he has dealt with them since he was 18.
In the post, he said he had been sober for almost two years until he began drinking again in May of last year.
""The Nashville Predators are saddened and disappointed for Austin Watson and his family as he enters the NHL/NHLPA Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program for alcohol-related treatment,"" the Predators said Tuesday in a statement. ""We are grateful for the NHL and NHLPA's program and will cooperate in any way necessary as we continue to support Austin and his family as they go through this difficult time.
""Because of the personal nature of the Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program and our exclusive focus on Austin and his family's well-being, there will be no further comment on this matter.""
Since returning from the suspension, Watson has seven goals and six assists in 34 games. He has spent his entire five-year career with the Predators, who selected him with the 18th pick in the first round of the 2010 draft.

25858716,"Decker, a U.S. women's national team hockey player, demonstrated the premier passing drill at the NHL All-Star skills event on Friday night. She appeared to record a time of 1 minute, 6 seconds in the demo, which beat the eight NHL player participants, including winner Leon Draisaitl (1:09). The winner of the event was to receive $25,000, and that prize went to Draisaitl -- which upset many fans.
On Saturday, the hockey manufacturing company CCM decided to pay Decker itself. In a tweet posted Saturday afternoon, CCM announced that it would give Decker $25,000.
We're gonna #PayDecker. pic.twitter.com/TbWSD7NAQP
An NHL spokesperson declined to comment.
There was some confusion about when exactly the clock started for Decker's demo, but it is noteworthy that six of the other NHL participants -- Thomas Chabot, Roman Josi, Erik Karlsson, Ryan O'Reilly, Mikko Rantanen and Keith Yandle -- took longer than 1:25 to complete the drill.
When asked about Decker's time after the competition, Draisaitl, the German-born Edmonton Oilers forward, said: ""She beat me. Wow. That is impressive. That's really impressive. Good for her.""
Decker, 27, plays for the Calgary Inferno of the CWHL. A University of Wisconsin alumna, she is the 2012 Patty Kazmaier Award winner as the top college hockey player in the country.
The NHL made news Friday by including Decker's U.S. women's national teammate, Kendall Coyne Schofield, in the fastest skater competition. Coyne Schofield became the first female to participate in the All-Star skills event. Coyne Schofield posted a time of 14.346 seconds, which placed seventh in a field that included Connor McDavid, Cam Atkinson, Mathew Barzal, Jack Eichel, Miro Heiskanen, Clayton Keller and Elias Pettersson. Coyne Schofield finished ahead of Keller's 14.526 seconds. McDavid won in 13.378, his third straight title in the event.
""Obviously, I was a little nervous,"" Coyne Schofield said afterward. ""But I knew it was a moment that was going to break a lot of barriers and a moment that would change the perception of our game.""
Coyne Schofield told ESPN on Ice on Saturday that she was aware of the groundswell of support for Decker, and she was on board for the campaign to get her paid: ""I think she took first place. I mean, absolutely. I agree.""
Also Saturday at the All-Star game, the NHL recognized Coyne Schofield, Decker and the two other women who demonstrated the drills (Canada's Renata Fast and Rebecca Johnston) on the JumboTron at the SAP Center, announcing that the league would donate $25,000 in the name of each player to the charity of her choice.
