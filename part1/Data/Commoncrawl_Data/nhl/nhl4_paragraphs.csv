25715600,"The defenseman recorded a video and texted it last week to Ty Cornett, a 13-year-old Detroit-area hockey player.
Cornett's father, Matthew Cornett, shared the video, which was recorded in Detroit during the Predators' visit to the city last week, on Reddit.
""I can tell you this right now: As long as you're still breathing in this world, you've got to believe in yourself and let nobody tell you what you can and can't do. Especially if it's because of the color of your skin,"" said Subban, who is black and was born in Toronto and previously starred with the Montreal Canadiens.
""In this world, some things happen that we don't really understand. That's OK. We don't have to understand them. All we need to do is understand ourselves, believe in ourselves, keep trying and keep pushing forward.
""I just want to tell you that when you're playing hockey, you play because you love the game and you want to play. Let nobody take that away from you.""
Matthew Cornett says Ty had asked for a Subban Canadiens jersey when he was 6 and wears the same No. 76 as the player.
""This year has been tough,"" Matthew Cornett wrote. ""My son is very aggressive and loud, so that brings out the trash talk. I have no problem with trash talking at all (part of the sport), but the racist talk needs to stop. Between the N-word being thrown at him over and over, being called monkey by players and parents, having an entire team beat their chests and act like gorillas whenever he touched the puck.
""This video meant more to my family than anything. I think my son has watched it over 500 times (no joke).""

2572430,"How we rank: We use a panel of voters, and these rankings reflect which teams voters think would win head-to-head matchups. Higher-ranked teams are favored over lower-ranked teams. A run of wins doesn't guarantee a jump, and a couple of losses doesn't guarantee a fall.
Previous ranking: 1
Points pace: 130. The Lightning are on pace for the best regular season since the Red Wings amassed 131 points in 1995-96. They're a full-on juggernaut, but there's a reason no one has cracked 130 points in 23 years. Under.
Previous ranking: 2
Points pace: 109. The Leafs were a 105-point team last season, so this mark is very much in reach. As long as goaltender Frederik Andersen remains steady (and healthy), this team will hit 110 points or better. Over.
Previous ranking: 5
Points pace: 109. The Flames are for real, and that plus-31 goal differential isn't just a product of better-than-expected goaltending. (And a .902 save percentage is ahead of where we thought they'd be.) Getting to 108 points in the wacky West is a tall order, but they're 100 percent a 100-point team. Under.
Football is king in the Cotton State, but from Huntsville to Birmingham and, yes, Tuscaloosa, there are many puckheads to be found.
The drawback to a muscular posterior? It's tough to find a pair of jeans that will fit. Connor McDavid and other NHL stars chronicle the struggle.
Only two goalies have won the Hart Trophy as MVP this millennium. Here's why the Ducks goalie should be No. 3, plus updates on all the other award races.
Previous ranking: 8
Points pace: 104. Due respect to the Sharks' recent roll and the return of Erik Karlsson to public adulation, but I can't trust a team with a .893 save percentage to stay on this pace. However, it's a playoff team, for sure. Under.
Previous ranking: 6
Points pace: 104. The Predators were a 117-point team last season, and this current pace comes after three months of significant injuries to top players like Filip Forsberg and P.K. Subban. A fully armed and operational Predators team will power past this current pace. Over.
Previous ranking: 4
Points pace: 109. This would be ahead of where the Capitals finished last season. As Alex Ovechkin showed with his All-Star Game decision, Washington knows that slow and steady can win the race again. Under.
Previous ranking: 3
Points pace: 109. The Jets are at this pace with Connor Hellebuyck playing to a .909 save percentage and Patrik Laine with one goal since Dec. 16. Those trends are going to reverse, and GM Kevin Cheveldayoff is going to pull off another Paul Stastny-esque move at the deadline. Over.

Previous ranking: 9
Points pace: 103. The Knights are probably a team that lands at around 100 points, but if there's anything we've learned in the past year, it's to not bet against Vegas. Over.
Previous ranking: 10
Points pace: 103. The goaltending has figured itself out, Sidney Crosby is playing at an MVP level and they're on an 11-2-0 roll. To quote an ancient ad campaign for an adult beverage: Beware of the Penguins. Over.
Previous ranking: 7
Points pace: 103. The Bruins and Leafs will flip-flop in the standings, with Toronto getting the No. 2 seed and home ice and Boston getting right around 103 points. Conservatively, we'll say they're just a shade below it. Under.
Previous ranking: 11
Points pace: 100. The teams chasing the top three in the Metropolitan are starting to close the gap a bit. We're a little worried about what GM Jarmo Kekalainen does with Artemi Panarin and Sergei Bobrovsky. The Jackets have been a 100-point team only once in franchise history. John Tortorella has hit that number only three times in 14 full seasons as an NHL coach. Under.
Previous ranking: 14
Points pace: 100. The Islanders are riding the PDO train this season (102.82 in combined shooting and save percentages). They're an amazing story, and they could very well be a playoff team, but they're probably also crossing the finish line with double-digit points. Under.

Points pace: 99. Are the Sabres going to have a 37-point improvement from last season? No. But they're going to have a 30-plus-point improvement, which is nothing to be ashamed of. Under.
Previous ranking: 18
Points pace: 93. If team president Jim Lites can savage his best players in profanity-laced tirades to the media every month or so, they're money. (Also, it'll be a big help if Ben Bishop keeps doing what he's been doing.) Over.
Previous ranking: 13
Points pace: 89. This pace has steadily decreased in the past two weeks, as the Avs have tried everything, including breaking up their heralded top line. The West is an absolute meat grinder, but I think the Avs can get back around that 95-point plateau. Over.
Previous ranking: 15
Points pace: 95. Middle of the pack in offense and defense, but not too reliant on one line to carry them. Claude Julien is a stealth Jack Adams candidate for squeezing as much juice out of this team as he has. Under.
Previous ranking: 17
Points pace: 88. It's a Bruce Boudreau team, which means it will ultimately exceed expectations and end up in a playoff spot even if it has no business being there. Over.
Previous ranking: 16
Points pace: 86. The Ducks have come back down to earth with the velocity of Skylab, as John Gibson's back strains from carrying the sixth-worst possession team and second-worst offensive team to the playoff bubble. We were right about Randy Carlyle, you guys. Under.
Previous ranking: 19
Points pace: 80. The Canucks are a team with some true offensive dynamos, but one that has trouble preventing both shot attempts and goals from opponents. This is, like, an 82-point team, but one that's at least going to be exciting to watch even as their playoff hopes fade. Over.
Postgame analysis and highlight show airing each night throughout the season from Barry Melrose and Linda Cohn. Watch on ESPN+
Previous ranking: 23
Points pace: 88. I refuse to believe that we're witnessing yet another season of incredible possession numbers that are submarined by either terrible goaltending or invisible offense. This year, it's the latter, as the Canes have a 7.3 shooting percentage, worst in the NHL. Ugh ... but they're better than 88 points. They have to be. Over.
Previous ranking: 22
Points pace: 82. Fun fact: Ken Hitchcock hasn't had a team finish with a points percentage lower than .625 since his final campaign with the Blue Jackets. It's going to happen this season, for sure, but the Oil are going to be better than 82 points in Peter Chiarelli's swan song. Over.
Previous ranking: 21
Points pace: 82. One of my chillier freezing cold takes is that the Panthers would be a 100-point team this season, which they most certainly will not be. Unless, of course, they go on some ridiculous winning streak, on which I've now dolloped a freezing cold take on top of a now-much-warmer take. Over.
Previous ranking: 20
Points pace: 80. This points pace doesn't take into account the roster pruning that most certainly will occur again at the trade deadline for the Rangers. Under.

Points pace: 76. If the Coyotes finish with 76 points, it will be the first six-point year-over-year improvement that ultimately feels like a downgrade. Over.
Previous ranking: 24
Points pace: 76. Wait: Are you saying we shouldn't expect a team with only two true finishers at forward and goaltending that's ranked 26th in save percentage will hit 97 points again? We still wager they get over 80. Over.
Previous ranking: 28
Points pace: 71. While doing as poorly as possible would behoove the Hawks in the long term, the fact is that this combination of prideful veterans and young players trying to earn their keep will be better than this current pace by season's end. Over.
Previous ranking: 25
Points pace: 71. This is right around where we expect the Wings to end up before a really, really interesting summer in Detroit when it comes to managerial decisions. Eh, we'll take the under for the sake of the draft. Under.

Points pace: 76. It's a lost season for the Blues, but one that'll see them beat this current pace. Perhaps via copious amounts of starts for Jordan Binnington over Jake Allen. Over.

Some NHL teams have two great goalies. For some, the backup is outplaying the starter. And then there are the Flyers. Here's our rundown of all 31 teams.
In three games this month, the 20-year-old Red Deer native has five goals and five assists, which is impressive. But here's ""impressive"" redefined: Vandervlis was in a medically induced coma last August after a freak campfire accident burned 50 percent of his body. He played in the WHL last season; after the accident, it was assumed he'd never play again. But Vandervlis wouldn't be denied, fighting back to play the sport that he loves.
""They said it'll take upwards of two years to fully mature and heal. My scars are pretty young still, but my body is capable of playing at this level, so that's what I'm doing,"" he told Lethbridge Now. (s/t reader Byron Hackett)
Hey, remember Sam Carrick? Well, he's playing for the Anaheim Ducks' affiliate after getting in three games for them this season. He tore it up last week: back-to-back three-point games for the Gulls, with two goals and four assists.
San Diego has won eight games in a row. Sounds like they have pretty good coach down there, with NHL experience, and probably ready for another shot at the show. If only there were a team in the same state that might need a new coach in short order...
Sometimes, our nominees don't have to do anything spectacular on the ice to merit a mention here. Such is the case with Moritz Müller, a 32-year-old German defenseman. Oh, he's an accomplished player, to be sure: Captain of the Kölner Haie of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga and a member of Germany's silver medal-winning Olympic men's hockey team in 2018. But the reason we're spotlighting him here is because he stood up for his sport.
On Saturday, the DEL Winter Game was held in Cologne between Kölner Haie and Düsseldorfer EG. These are long-standing rivals, and they played in a soccer stadium in front of 54,000 fans, and it was awesome.

Alas, despite all that fanfare, it wasn't covered at all on the nation's biggest Saturday night sports show, Aktuellen Sportstudio. Which didn't set well with Müller. He took to Facebook and Instagram and blasted the show, calling it ""Soccer Studio"" and slamming it for covering that sport more during its Winter Break than it did this hockey game.
Their meek response to his critique? That the hockey news didn't make the cut due to some ""technical difficulties.""
Full marks to Moritz Müller for standing up for his sport. (s/t to Simon Wittke for the nomination.)
She didn't see the ice during the game, but Keast made history in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. The 17-year-old served as a backup goalie for the Ice Wolves on an emergency basis, and league officials believe she broke the SJHL's bender barrier. The team had traded away a goalie and the one they acquired as a replacement wasn't going to make the game in time. So Keast stepped in, having been mentioned by a local midget hockey coach. She took warmups, but didn't play.
""It was good. I was really nervous,"" she said. ""So my movements were off a bit. But it was still a pretty cool experience."" (s/t to Chris Clark)
And the best player in the world of the week is ...
Now, who is Patrick Doyle?
He's a star for St. Ignatius College Prep in the Chicago Catholic Hockey League, which hasn't had a team win the Illinois state championship since 2012. But Doyle and the Wolfpack are 28-4-2, and might give the league its best shot at one in some time.
Speaking of shots, that's why Doyle is our honored player of the week. He's had a great season, with 26 goals and eight assists heading into this weekend's games. He's never been better than he was against the Benet Academy Redwings on Sunday, the team right behind St. Ignatius in the standings (and the alma mater of his father). Doyle had a hat trick, and his final goal of the trick came as the buzzer sounded -- in overtime!

- St. Ignatius Hockey (@SICPBoysHockey) January 14, 2019
I mean, c'mon, we get how many buzzer-beaters in a hockey year? Three, maybe? And this one was such a stunner that no one even remembered to throw a hat for Doyle.
The senior is chasing a scoring title for St. Ignatius this season, which is something no one on the team assumed he could before this season. Because, as it turns out, he wasn't on the team.
As reader Andrew Weiss of Northwestern University, who nominated Doyle, writes: ""Doyle made a decision over the summer to attend Northfield Mount Hermon High School in Massachusetts, a big hockey prep school in the Northeast. Right before the hockey season started, Doyle elected to come back and play his senior year with St. Ignatius, a team with his close friends and his younger brother Sean.""
The Wolfpack certainly are happy he made that call.
For an incredible moment and an incredible season, Patrick Doyle is the Best Player In The World Of The Week.

"
25784759?utm_source=thenewsprint.co&utm_medium=fresh_link,"""They're running around corners, printing. That's what was happening,"" said Chris Foster, the NHL's director of digital business development.
The coaches wanted to innovate the process, and the league listened. The SAP-NHL Coaching Insights App will begin appearing on coaches' iPads located at the benches and in the dressing rooms -- which are currently used for video replays -- as early as February.
No more waiting for the printer to churn out stat sheets. The data will now arrive in the hands of coaches as the game is going on, in real time. No more waiting until intermission to analyze the numbers; now, coaches can make informed adjustments to everything, from faceoff choices to ice time, on the fly.
""This will provide real-time data, analytics and metrics to complement the video and give them what they want in the live game environment,"" Dave Lehanski, the NHL's senior VP of business development and innovation, told ESPN. ""As far as we know, we'll be the only sports property delivering real-time video and data to the benches for the coaches and the players.""
In 2017, the NHL and Apple partnered to build an in-arena, in-game coaching system that allowed teams to review video highlights during the game. The request was made by players and coaches, and the system was well-received.
Over time, coaches began asking about adding real-time stats to the iPads. So the NHL, Apple and SAP began collaborating with bench coaches, video coaches and team analytics analysts to determine what data they'd need during the game to better make decisions, and how best to deliver it. The result is a clean interface that brings the real-time stats found on the league's website during games, as well as exclusive features, into the hands of coaches during play.
ESPN got a glimpse of the app this week, which will be loaded onto new iPad Pro tablets for the teams. (These tablets, by the way, are restricted for use in the arena only, because of security concerns.) It allows teams to monitor any number of stats, from broad categories like shot attempts to narrower ones like faceoff success in certain areas of the ice and against certain opponents. Coaches can dial up which type of shot their players have used in a shootout the most, and what type of goals their netminders have surrendered.
Each data category is customizable, so coaches can specify which stats they're most interested in tracking. But there's also player customization: Coaches can set a particular ice time target for a skater, and then receive data on how close to that target a player is after each shift.
""There are two stat types across the board that every coaching staff said that, without question, helped them make in-game moment decisions: Time on ice and faceoffs,"" Foster said. ""With time on ice, you want to manage your top players to make sure they have gas in the tank at the end of the game, or if they're coming back from an injury.""
For both ice time and faceoffs, the app offers something that the coaches uniformly requested from the NHL: easy-to-read displays. Faceoff success or failure is depicted as a series of green circles with check marks or red circles with X's, and faceoff percentages can be broken down by where they were held and against whom.
""While coaches consider season performance or career performance, it's what they're doing in that game that matters,"" said Foster.
Players that are near or over their ice time projection during the game will have their names displayed in red, with a small red triangle with an exclamation point next to their photo -- similar to a ""check engine"" light on a car dashboard.
There's also the ability to map shots on goal for different situations, locations and specific players, with real-time data on the results of those shot attempts. But that information is the tip of the massive iceberg slowly moving the NHL into the future. Puck and player tracking technology is in its final testing stages, and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman expects that it will be used by teams and on broadcasts beginning next season.
While the SAP-NHL Coaching Insights App will help coaches for the rest of this season, Foster admits this is only Version 1.0 of what's to come with the data dump of player tracking tech. By next season, coaches could use it to track everything from the distances their players have skated to the velocity and placement of their shots each period.
""If the demand [for this] isn't there right now, it'll definitely be there when player and puck tracking arrives,"" he said.

He in the final year of his contract and so far has declined to sign a long-term extension.
In his last outing, Bobrovsky allowed four goals on 19 shots before being replaced by Joonas Korpisalo midway through the third period in a 4-0 loss to Tampa Bay on Tuesday.
In other moves, Columbus recalled goaltender Jean-Francois Berube from the AHL Cleveland Monsters while placing center Brandon Dubinsky and left wing Markus Hannikainen on injured reserve.
Dubinsky will be sidelined at least one week with a hamstring injury, while Hannikainen will also be out at least a week with an elbow injury.
Berube, who will likely serve as the backup to Korpisalo for Thursday's game, has a 9-10-4 career record in 34 NHL games with the New York Islanders and Chicago Blackhawks.

25717029,"McKenna started against the defending Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals on Tuesday night and allowed four goals on 25 shots in a 5-3 loss. He got the nod because interim coach Scott Gordon wanted to give top goaltending prospect Carter Hart a break after playing twice in three days.
Jakub Vrana scored twice to set a career high in goals and added an assist to help the Washington Capitals beat the Philadelphia Flyers 5-3 Tuesday night and hand their division rivals their eighth consecutive loss.
The Flyers became the fourth team in league history to use seven goalies, joining the 1989-90 Quebec Nordiques, 2002-03 St. Louis Blues and 2007-08 Los Angeles Kings. Brian Elliott, Michal Neuvirth, Calvin Pickard, Alex Lyon and Anthony Stolarz have also tended goal for Philadelphia.
Because of injuries, the Flyers reached the seven-goalie mark in their 43rd game.
Philadelphia claimed the 35-year-old McKenna off waivers from the Canucks last week when Neuvirth was injured again. Vancouver acquired McKenna in a trade from the Ottawa Senators two days earlier.
McKenna had black tape all over his mask and black and orange tape on his pads to match the colors of the ninth NHL team he has dressed for. In previous seasons, he played for the Tampa Bay Lightning, New Jersey Devils, Columbus Blue Jackets, Arizona Coyotes and Dallas Stars.
""He competes and he battles,"" Gordon said of McKenna. ""When you play for as long as he has, that's something people appreciate, the fact that you bring it every day in practice and games.""
McKenna fell to 1-5-1 this season, and his only victory came against the Flyers while playing for the Senators. He recognized his first game with Philadelphia wasn't his best.
""I'd be lying to you if I didn't say it was a little bit of a challenge just from a lot of different logistical standpoints, but my job is to play hockey and be a goaltender and stop the puck, and no matter what team I'm on I'm going to do that to the best of my ability,"" McKenna said. ""At the end of the day, we're all trying to do the same thing and that's win hockey games regardless of who we're playing against. The NHL is a challenge no matter what. Every team has players that can do this, so you've got to bring your A-game.""
Gordon, who replaced the fired Dave Hakstol behind Philadelphia's bench, was one of the Nordiques' seven goaltenders 29 years ago. He said this is different because Quebec was 9-34-6 at the time he was called up.
""The team at that point, there was a fire sale that was going to happen at the trade deadline,"" Gordon said. ""They were out of the playoffs. Different situation. There were some major changes that were done at that point.""
The Flyers have now lost eight in a row and are 30th in the 31-team NHL.

25731305,"And yet, there's never any point to it, because every single team executive in the league that complains about ""cost certainty"" or competitive imbalance or a broken system will be elbowing his peers out of the way to circumvent or undermine the rules. That's how we ended up with 15-year contracts with minimum wage final seasons after the 2004-05 lost season. That's how we ended up with things like David Clarkson's contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs that attempted to accomplish the same thing -- paying $21.75 million in guaranteed money in the first five years of the deal, leaving $6 million in signing bonuses for the last two seasons, with a base salary of $1 million for five of the seven years -- the summer after the 2012 lockout.
The Lightning and Leafs maintain the top spots, with big movers elsewhere. Plus, which teams will finish above or below their current pace?
The drawback to a muscular posterior? It's tough to find a pair of jeans that will fit. Connor McDavid and other NHL stars chronicle the struggle.
Some NHL teams have two great goalies. For some, the backup is outplaying the starter. And then there are the Flyers. Here's our rundown of all 31 teams.
The CBA establishes rules. Teams figure out ways around them. The next CBA seeks to remedy that. Rinse, repeat.
The NHL and the NHLPA had talks in Las Vegas this week, with commissioner Gary Bettman sounding optimistic that the CBA issues could be settled without a work stoppage -- and ahead of the 2020 World Cup of Hockey. ""We'll see what happens, but I'm not looking for a fight,"" said Bettman, who inevitably always ends up in one when the players are across the table.
A word on the next CBA: There is optimism on both sides that they could get something done without a work stoppage for the first time in Bettman's tenure with the NHL, which began in 1993. But there's also pessimism on the owners' side that the players won't strike, but will refuse to sign a new CBA, thereby ""forcing"" the owners to lock them out. Which, of course, could be avoided if the owners are reasonable with their employees and don't give them reason to do so. But as we've seen, that's asking a lot.
Truth is, there isn't much to fight about for the owners in this round, although the players have a number of issues over which to battle: Olympic participation, redefining hockey-related revenue, player-tracking data and its usage, as well as the biggest elephant in the herd packed into that room: escrow, or the percentage of money taken from the players' paychecks that ensures that there is a 50/50 split between owners and players for that season's revenue.
The players hate escrow with the fury of a thousand burning suns. (Perhaps some of that hatred should be pointed at the people who conceded to the NHL and allowed the league to implement a salary cap a dozen years ago, but that's another column ...)
It's expected that the NHLPA is going to try to fix this escrow mess, but you obviously have to give something to get something; or, if you're Bettman, at least give the appearance of giving something to get something, even if you always intended to give that something anyway. Which is a long-winded way of saying, ""Of course the NHL is playing in the Beijing Olympics.""
What could the players offer? One theory from Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman is that contract term limits could be back on the table.
That's logical, given that contract limitation is one of the few sugary bits those Veruca Salts on the NHL's board of governors haven't gotten their sticky hands on. Please recall the last lockout, when the NHL and its owners wanted a five-year term limit on contracts, with a seven-year term limit for re-signing a team's own players. It was, in the words of Bill Daly, ""the hill we will die on."" Well, RIP, because the players ended up with an eight-year limit for a re-signed player and a seven-year limit for a free agent.
This week's episode makes some ESPN On Ice history. To incorporate the voice of the listener, Greg Wyshynski and Emily Kaplan opened up the phone lines to field great hockey questions from our loyal fan base. Plus, find out if we get stumped by this week's ""Sach Got Your Number."" And Linda Cohn advises what the New York Rangers should do in the way of future front-office moves. Listen »
There was always a lot of speculation about how serious the owners were about getting term limits down to five years; in fact, many people around the last lockout assume the NHL knew it could never get the players to agree to that number. But if the players came to the table with it now, in exchange for some reduction or recalculation on escrow, what would happen?
The owners would be down with it, obviously, because they don't really have to worry about the nuances of the salary cap and all the dominoes that would fall if contract terms were capped. That's why they're owners: Reduce costs, pay someone else to figure out the details.
Pay someone like Jakub Voracek his $8.25 million cap hit for five years, rather than owe him that plus $21.25 million over the next three years where his $8.25 million cap hit nearly makes him untradeable. Give Jamie Benn a contract that carries something like a $10.5 million cap hit for five years, rather than one that goes on for eight years and has $16.5 million in guaranteed bonus money over the last three.
The ability to reduce the payroll and offer less job security are like a warm blanket for owners. Why do you think they attempt to break unions like they're cracking walnuts?
The general managers, meanwhile, probably aren't in sync with their bosses. Long-term contracts allow them to keep their cores together longer, and control costs by bringing down the overall cap hits with reduced salaries in latter seasons. Short-term contracts with players that would otherwise receive those soft-circumvention deals would mean huge cap hits. To use Benn again: His base salary in his first three years is $13 million annually. What does that cap hit look like on, say, a five-year deal: $12 million, rather than $9.5 million? That's a $2.5 million difference annually, or one whole Blake Comeau.
The only thing an NHL GM might find attractive about term limits is that it would really shake up the trade market for high-end players, at least in theory. It's no longer waiting for the seventh year of an eight-year deal before a trade partner is willing to take on a high cap hit -- it would be the fourth year of a five-year deal, in theory. So at the very least, player movement would increase, which would make the trade deadline a little more interesting than watching a dozen Canadian guys on their phones waiting to get a text from Lee Stempniak's agent on his next destination.
I hate escrow, but I hope the players don't give up long-term contracts in order to be rid of it. First, because they'll never, ever, ever get them back. Like, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. Second, because I think they do more good than harm. They allow teams to retain the players they develop. They allow teams to retain those players at a cap figure that then allows them to retain other players as well as sign useful free agents. Give me strong, dynastic teams over the wet oatmeal of forced parity every time.
Finally, they provide a modicum of job security to players in a sport where they're treated as disposable. So, for the players' sake, I'd like theirs to remain a long-term relationship with their teams, rather than a CBA-shortened fling.

My friend Jon ""Japers' Rink"" Press published a rather amazing note recently about Alex Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby:
Amazing to me that these two dudes made their respective NHL debuts on the same night and now, 4,844 days later, through ups and downs (mostly ups), injuries and so on, they have the exact same number of regular season points, more than anyone else over that span. Such greatness. pic.twitter.com/nvbhOJpI4K
- Japers' Rink �� (@JapersRink) January 9, 2019
Obviously, Crosby wins on points per game and Stanley Cup wins and head-to-head playoff wins and gold medals and yadda yadda, but it is completely wacky that these two titans of the NHL are this close in career points over 13 years after their debut seasons. You know, the one where Ovechkin did the one thing that's impossible for Crosby to accomplish, which is winning rookie of the year.
We've all come to appreciate both players, and will continue to do so long after they're retired. But isn't it incredible that both entered the league at the same time with such hype, made such marks as young players and then exceeded those expectations for the rest of their careers into 2019? That's an absolute rarity in pro sports.

All of this unpleasantness with Sergei Bobrovsky this week has obscured the big story with the Columbus Blue Jackets, which is that the local business community has now resorted to bribery to retain the services of pending free-agent forward Artemi Panarin.
First, there was High Bank Distillery, which put up a billboard that read ""Hey Panarin, Stick with Columbus and enjoy free High Bank for life,"" and had a giant arrow pointing to that basic necessity for the cold Columbus nights, vodka.
""And I was listening to sports talk radio about the (Panarin) contract negotiations, and I thought, 'Oh, man,'"" Adam Hines, a co-founder of the distillery, told the Columbus Dispatch. ""It was a no-brainer. We figured it was well worth the risk, so we made the investment, and it's been awesome.""
As a marketing scheme, it worked to perfection: Panarin (hilariously) took a photo in front of the sign and the Jackets tweeted it out to their followers:
Looks like �� found his billboard.#CBJ pic.twitter.com/D9CG2BnUgF

The trend continued with a local dentist offering her services to Panarin. Obviously there's a big difference between the two, as the Blue Jackets don't have a team vodka distiller, but we're sure Panarin's good on the dental stuff.
We really hope this trend continues until the NHL has to address concerns about potential cap circumvention.

The 27-year-old DeSmith is 12-7-4 with a 2.47 goals-against average and a .924 save percentage for the Penguins. DeSmith began the season as the backup behind Matt Murray but played regularly during November and December while Murray dealt with a lower-body injury and inconsistent play.
General manager Jim Rutherford praised DeSmith for excelling under difficult circumstances. During a 12-start stretch from Nov. 21-Dec. 31, DeSmith went 8-3-1 to help the Penguins shake off a slow start to get back into the playoff picture in the crowded Metropolitan Division.

25714010,"Jaskirat Singh Sidhu made a brief appearance in a Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, court and pleaded guilty to 16 counts of dangerous driving causing death, as well as 13 counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. There will be no trial.
Sentencing will begin Jan 28. Sidhu faces maximum sentences of 14 years for dangerous driving causing death and 10 years for dangerous driving causing bodily harm.
Sidhu did not speak as he left the court, but his lawyer, Mark Brayford, read a prepared statement to reporters.
Brayden Camrud and Derek Patter were back on the ice for the Humboldt Broncos in September for the team's first game since 10 teammates and six other people were killed in a bus crash.
""I asked him what his position was,"" Brayford said. ""And his position to me was, 'I just want to plead guilty. I don't want you to plea bargain, I don't want a trial.' Mr. Sidhu advised me, 'I don't want to make things any worse. I can't make things any better, but I certainly won't want to make them worse by having a trial.'""
Brayford said Sidhu wanted people to know that he was ""devastated"" and he wanted the families impacted to know ""he's devastated by the grief that he's caused them."" Brayford added that Sidhu is ""overwhelmed by the expressions of sympathy and kindness that some of the families and players have expressed to him, in spite of the fact that grief is entirely his fault.""
On April 6, 2018, the Humboldt Broncos -- a junior hockey team of 16-to-21-year-olds -- were en route to a playoff game when their bus collided with Sidhu's truck, which was carrying peat moss. Sixteen people -- including 10 players and the team's head coach -- were killed and another 13 players were injured.
Sidhu, 29, was arrested in July at his home in Calgary following a lengthy investigation. Sidhu was not hurt in the crash.
The Broncos released a statement Tuesday, thanking Sidhu ""for taking responsibility for his actions"" and expressing relief at avoiding a trial.
""Mr. Sidhu's guilty pleas are a positive step in the healing process for the survivors, grieving families, the team and our community,"" Broncos president Jamie Brockman said. ""I commend Mr. Sidhu for taking responsibility for his actions and sparing the survivors and the families the anguish and turmoil of rehashing this tragedy in court.
""I know Mr. Sidhu has also been deeply affected by this tragedy. His careless actions will haunt him for the rest of his life, and I'm sure it is a relief to move forward.""
The tragedy reverberated across the hockey community and internationally. A GoFundMe account for the Humboldt team raised more than $15 million in less than two weeks, as more than 140,000 people donated from more than 80 countries. It is the second-largest GoFundMe campaign globally, trailing only the $21.5 million raised for the Time's Up legal defense fund. The money raised will be split among the 29 families affected.

25794029,"In the past, we've used this space to look at things like John Gibson being in a league of his own, how the Islanders have exceeded expectations, and the drama in Dallas. This week, we're going to investigate the seemingly lopsided trade between the Hurricanes and Wild, and reopen the conversation about the best line in hockey.
Earlier this week, my colleagues and I were asked to do a quick blurb on who we thought was the best line in hockey at this very moment. As you'd expect, most of the usual suspects were brought up in the discussion. The most notable glaring omission that we collectively missed out on was the Columbus Blue Jackets' top line, which has been terrorizing the rest of the league since the moment John Tortorella put Artemi Panarin, Cam Atkinson and Pierre-Luc Dubois together at some point last season.
Despite the fact that they don't get recognition similar to their closest peers -- perhaps because of a combination of the market they play in and relative lack of name-brand value -- there isn't a single forward trio that's combined to score more five-on-five goals than they have. When you throw defense into the equation, the prolific top line in Colorado is the only one currently sporting a more lopsided goal differential:
Just as impressive are all of the underlying shot metrics, which completely and unequivocally validate that dominance, suggesting that they're just getting started. In the time the trio has spent together on the ice at five-on-five, the Blue Jackets have controlled an astounding 55.4 percent of the overall shot attempts, 57.1 percent of the shots on target and 58.4 percent of the attempts coming from high-danger areas.
Which pairings would be most entertaining? Plus, fallout from the 2020 World Cup cancellation, the Week in Gritty, Jersey Fouls and more.
The Hurricanes and Wild pulled off a one-for-one trade. Which team came out ahead? We grade both GMs on the swap.
The NHL trade season is underway. Get caught up on the assets, restrictions and potential moves for every team ahead of the Feb. 25 deadline.
It's easy to see why they've been so successful when you watch them. It's a perfect marriage of individual skill sets, all working in unison to create something beautiful. Dubois is a menace around the net, incredibly difficult to knock off the puck. He's hardly just a big body, though it seems almost unfair that someone his size (listed at 6-foot-3, 207 pounds) would also possess his buttery touch.
Atkinson is a pure goal scorer, and he knows precisely where to be to get his shot off at all times. After a disastrous start to last season -- which was particularly alarming considering he'd just signed a mega $41 million-plus extension that had yet to even kick in -- he's been scorching hot since last season's All-Star break. During that stretch of 77 games, he's scored a whopping 44 goals and put the puck on net an even more stunning 310 times.
As good as those two are, and they certainly aren't passengers by any means, the one who makes it all flow smoothly is Panarin. He's a wizard on the ice, as exciting to watch with the puck on his stick as any player in the entire league. He sees things on the ice very few do and attempts to make plays that even fewer would dare. Since coming to Columbus, he's taken his game up another level, proving that he wasn't just a beneficiary of his environment in Chicago during his first two seasons -- that he's actually well-suited for a leading role. In his 125 games with the Blue Jackets, he's 16th in the NHL in overall point production and 15th in primary points. At five-on-five, he's fifth, with 86 points, and only the likes of Connor McDavid, Nikita Kucherov and Nathan MacKinnon have directly factored into creating a higher number of goals.
Put all of that together, and the Blue Jackets have a line that can not only go head-to-head against any of the top lines in the league in the postseason, but actually give Columbus a puncher's chance to make some noise and win a playoff series for the first time in franchise history. The thought of that is so enticing that it's perfectly understandable that GM Jarmo Kekalainen would be willing to take the risk of playing this thing out and seeing where it goes, even if it means eventually losing impending free agent Panarin (and fellow UFA Sergei Bobrovsky) for nothing this summer instead of moving them at the trade deadline.
On Thursday afternoon, we were treated to a good old-fashioned hockey trade. It was a one-for-one swap straight across, with no money being retained either way and no draft picks packaged along with the players. The deal saw Nino Niederreiter being sent to the Carolina Hurricanes, with Victor Rask going back the other way to join the Minnesota Wild.
We start this episode by reviewing Emily Kaplan's piece on ""Hockey Butts,"" which drew reaction from around the sports world. Former NHL goaltender Marty Biron weighs in on the Sabres' struggles, including the future of Jeff Skinner in Buffalo (14:12). Rangers defenseman Marc Staal joins to talk about his family's NHL success, as well as his future in New York (33:00).  Listen »
On the surface, it's easy to see what both teams were trying to accomplish, although the actual execution of it really checks out for only one of them. By doing the deal, the Wild shed some salary, with Rask being owed $12 million total during the next three seasons following this one, compared to the $15.575 million Niederreiter is set to make. Rask is also a couple months younger and plays a more highly sought after position as a center. The issue is that he's also a substantially less-effective player by any objective measure.
Niederreiter has undoubtedly had his share of offensive struggles this season, on an 82-game pace for just 16 goals and 41 points. At five-on-five, he's averaging 1.39 points and 1.07 primary points per 60 minutes, both of which represent a sizable decline from previous campaigns; these rates are about half of what he produced in his career-best 2016-17 season. And yet, as depressed as both of those figures are, they're still better than Victor Rask's averages for his NHL career to date: 1.37 and 0.98, respectively.
The bigger issue here beyond the specifics of either player -- since it's clear that Niederreiter is a superior talent -- is that the trade itself is a classic example by the Wild of how not to handle an asset. By trading Niederreiter at this particular point in time, they were selling him at his absolute nadir, which is immediately evident in the return. It's a cold way to look at things, but the NHL is a business, and being able to carefully manage the value of your assets is a crucial skill.
While Niederreiter himself isn't entirely without blame, the main driving force behind his minus-11 rating for the season is due to factors that are ultimately largely out of his control. Look at how his goalies have performed behind him when he's been on the ice this season, and how it stacks up to his career norms. With an on-ice save percentage like that, it's no wonder he fell out of favor the way he did.
Ironically enough, he was also traded following that historically dreadful 2011-12, largely because of this motley crew he shared the ice with, netting the Islanders just Cal Clutterbuck and a third-round pick in return for a player they'd drafted fifth overall just two years prior. That was truly an unrivaled master class on how not to handle a top prospect.
For the uninitiated, PDO -- a proxy for ""puck luck"" that is the sum of a player or team's on-ice shooting and save percentages -- is a crude figure that certainly has its flaws. It's often misused as a crutch argument, with a lack of understanding of what it actually means and what's causing its fluctuations. That said, it has some utility in cases like this, because it can go a long way toward quickly identifying why the perception of a player has been flipped on its head the way it has with Niederreiter this season. What's more likely of these two scenarios: that a 26-year-old with a number of strong individual campaigns stacked up consecutively suddenly forgot how to play hockey, or that he's just been the victim of some unfortunate bounces over the course of a 50-game sample?

Carolina is betting that it's the latter, banking on countless past examples over the years. It's a smart, calculated risk for them to take because the upside is awfully high when (not if) Niederreiter returns to his previous form. It's especially smart considering the relatively low price they had to pay to make that wager.
Not only do the Hurricanes make out like bandits here, but the rich also get richer in a sense. A team that's been an absolute nightmare to contend with at five-on-five this season -- Carolina is second in shot share and first in expected goals -- now adds a player who has historically been a strong possession driver in his own right. Over the course of his six seasons in Minnesota, the Wild controlled 53.3 percent of the shot attempts and 56.1 percent of the goals scored at five-on-five whenever Niederreiter was out on the ice. That was 5.4 and 4.6 percentage points better relative to what his teammates did without him, respectively.
If the Hurricanes can continue to drag their shooting percentage out of the early-season gutter and turn a higher percentage of that high volume of attempts into goals, then look out. An already crowded Eastern Conference playoff picture might just be adding another viable threat.

25780446,"The news came out following a meeting between the two groups in Toronto on Wednesday.
""While the parties have now jointly concluded that it is no longer realistic to try to schedule a Word Cup of Hockey for the fall of 2020, they plan to continue their dialogue with a hope of being able to schedule the next World Cup event as part of a broader agreement, which would include a long-term international event calendar,"" the NHL said in a statement.
The NHLPA released its own statement, saying, ""The players are focused on finding the proper time to schedule the World Cup of Hockey within the context of an overall international hockey calendar."" The NHLPA added that it was ""unrealistic to expect preparations for the event would be completed in time.""
Steven Stamkos, John Tavares, Victor Hedman and others comment on the NHL-NHLPA decision to forgo the event.
The NHL and the union have started informal labor talks over the past few weeks. Both sides have the option to opt out of the current collective bargaining agreement in September 2019. The deal is set to expire in 2020.
Both sides had expressed optimism about getting the World Cup of Hockey done, but without an official deadline, they were not able to come to an agreement in time to arrange the tournament. Now discussions will mostly shift to items in the upcoming CBA.
The World Cup of Hockey is organized by the NHL and NHLPA, unlike other international events like the World Ice Hockey Championships and the Olympics, which are run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The World Cup of Hockey has typically occurred in September, before NHL training camps open.
There have been three iterations of the World Cup of Hockey -- in 1996, in 2004 and in 2016. The 2016 Games, hosted by Toronto, featured a popular format that included two All-Star teams: Team Europe and the under-23 Team North America.
International competitions are generally very popular among NHL players. The world championships occur during the Stanley Cup playoffs, so only players whose NHL teams have been eliminated can participate. The NHL did not send players to the Olympics in 2018 for the first time in two decades.

25793488,"We're not talking about the points system and its forced parity, with which they seem quite pleased. We're talking about the teams currently in the mix for the Stanley Cup playoffs and, in turn, potentially the Stanley Cup Final. No Chicago. No Los Angeles. No Philadelphia. No Detroit, unfortunately as per the recent status quo. They've got the Islanders instead of the Rangers. They can find Winnipeg and Calgary in the top spots of their respective divisions, two cities that casual sports fans in the U.S. would be challenged to find in an atlas. They'd also be challenged to find an atlas, now that I think about it.

While hockey fans are understandably thrilled with the churn rate of contenders, offering fresh matchups and new possibilities for champions, there aren't a ton of safe and familiar bets for the NHL when it comes to a slam-dunk ratings and interest-driving Stanley Cup Final. Which is to say that Gary Bettman must be burning incense in front of Sidney Crosby, Alex Ovechkin and Zdeno Chara bobblehead dolls to will them into the Final, preferably against Vegas or Nash-Vegas.
But here's the thing: Taking the current standings (through Thursday night), there are a bunch of really interesting matchups on the table.
Here is our ranking of the top 10 current potential Stanley Cup matchups, with the only rule being that the team had to have been in a playoff position by Friday morning. (Sorry, Edmonton ... darn regulation win tiebreakers.) It was compiled by the ESPN NHL editorial staff, based on several factors, including: Appeal to casual fans, quality of play and potential for drama. And apparently Columbus, Colorado, Minnesota and Dallas do not generate enough of those things because no potential series involving those teams made the list.
Enjoy!

While it might not bring in the casual fans, a head-to-head referendum on the P.K. Subban trade with the Stanley Cup on the line is the stuff of hockey nerd dreams. Add in two incredible arena environments, the ""Caddyshack""-esque ""snobs vs. slobs"" appeal of a Canadiens vs. team from Tennessee battle, and the potential for some real acrimony ... and this could be a great series that no one who isn't a die-hard fan is watching.

This is one that I felt should be higher on the list because I have a feeling it could get contentious in a real hurry, mostly because there's a chance that Brad Marchand will attempt to lick Logan Couture and Couture bites his tongue off like a rabid wolverine. Also, if Joe Thornton is going to win the Stanley Cup, let it be in Boston in front of Jeremy Jacobs.

From a pure hockey perspective, this would be a terrifically played series between arguably the two best teams in their respective conferences. Both arenas would be popping, there would be offensive fireworks. But this is one of those series that one hopes would create some drama as it plays out, because on paper it's a little ... just there.

Given the offensive abilities of these teams, this could be a bonkers series. Given the presence of Matthew Tkachuk and his task of shutting down the likes of Mitch Marner, it could be a nasty one, too. Oh, and one of these teams hasn't won a Stanley Cup since the year The Who first performed in America. But hey, they're touring again in 2019!

My preseason Stanley Cup Final pick would be a fun one given the talent on both sides, and an intriguing ""what if"" series given that the Bolts were reportedly after Erik Karlsson for a bit. There are a lot of veteran players who are thirsty for a Cup on both sides. And it would rope in the casual fans, as both teams have made appearances in the Final in the past few seasons.

Speaking of repeat performers in the Final, this is still an attractive matchup from a casual fan perspective. Plus, doesn't Nashville deserve another shot at the Penguins with a healthy Ryan Johansen? Or, more to the point, doesn't Pekka Rinne deserve another shot at winning in Pittsburgh?

It's hard to figure out how the sports world is going to react when the Leafs make the Stanley Cup Final. Will they be treated like hockey's Chicago Cubs, as we all put aside allegiances and root for an epic drought to end? Or will they still be treated like the Leafs? I would offer that if their opponents are the sweet, loveable small-market Canadian darlings from Winnipeg, then the Leafs would be treated like the Leafs, as Manitoba's own chase their first Cup in Jets history and the first for the city since 1902. Now that's a drought.

Take the biggest star in the NHL, put him in the biggest spectacle in the NHL and stick his best friend in goal across the ice seeking revenge against the team who shuffled him off in an expansion draft. Then. Print. Money. The only reason this isn't No. 1 is because the novelty of the Knights being in the Final isn't what it was in 2018. And because they lost.

The team that beat the Golden Knights? The Capitals. Not only are the Caps a fun team, with a megastar in Alex Ovechkin, but to see this perennial disappointment potentially post back-to-back Cup wins would be something. The Predators would be a worthy foil, and obviously a team with designs on their own championship breakthrough. Plus, we haven't had enough Filip Forsberg trade stories in our lives, have we?

The top choice from our panel. Two meticulously constructed teams that have been Stanley Cup bridesmaids in recent years. Two ""non-traditional"" markets that offer their own rabid fan bases and singular charms. Star players all over the ice. How fun would this be?
As editor Tim Kavanagh put it, ""Buffalo vs. anyone.""
The Sabres aren't in a postseason spot as we roll this feature, but let's be honest: The Sabres going from last place in the NHL in 2017-18 with 62 points, to the Stanley Cup Final the next season would be an incredible story, perhaps even bigger than ""Buffalo team attempts to win championship.""
Throw anyone in the West in this series and we're watching. And by ""anyone"" we of course mean the Dallas Stars with Brett Hull dropping the first puck in Game 1. C'mon, it has to happen.
Goalie Mike McKenna is the seventh netminder to play for the Philadelphia Flyers this season. The Flyers are also the fourth team McKenna has played for this season, after time in Ottawa, AHL Belleville and Vancouver.
So it's entirely possible that McKenna might not be a Flyer for all that long. But hey, if you're playing in Philadelphia, might as well make the most of it. And by that we mean putting Gritty on your mask:

Congrats to Mike McKenna on this career achievement.
I'd like the Dallas Stars to make the playoffs because the NHL is nothing if not a copycat league, which means there's a good chance it would usher in an era where team presidents cut profanity-laden promos on star players with the scorching efficiency of Bill Burr taking down a heckler at the Chuckle Hut.
I'd rather the Colorado Avalanche not make the playoffs because that would mean there's at least a theoretical chance they could end up with the top two picks in the NHL draft, which has never happened in league history, going back to 1979. How amazing would that be? They could end up with Jack Hughes and Kaapo Kakko. Or they could turn around and say, ""Hey, Maple Leafs, before you go and pay Auston Matthews how about we discuss if he's worth the top two picks in the draft and Tyson Barrie ...""
I don't want the Minnesota Wild to make the playoffs because no one needs to see another five-game first-round defeat before Bruce Boudreau gets fired so Paul Fenton can hire his own guy.
I want the Edmonton Oilers to make the playoffs because Connor McDavid belongs on the greatest stage of the season, even if it's just for one round, and so I can vote for him in the Hart Trophy race; and because GM Peter Chiarelli getting yet another stay of execution would drive the fan base to the brink of psychopathy.
I don't want the Anaheim Ducks in the playoffs because I believe in science, and the science tells me that this team is terrible in about a dozen ways, has a coach who should have been fired and has been dragged to relevance by John Gibson.
I don't want the St. Louis Blues in the playoffs, even though I predicted they'd get there, because we've already written our obituaries on this team and now it's risen from the dead; frankly, going from ""hey, they might trade Vladimir Tarasenko"" to counting points behind the wild card has given us a serious case of whiplash.
I want the Arizona Coyotes to make the playoffs because I want only the best for this sweet beleaguered franchise -- even though once again, that's not going to happen.
But most of all, I want the Vancouver Canucks to make the wild card. Out of all the teams we've listed here, they might be the only one that feels like they're on the upswing. When they're rolling, the Canucks have that B.P.E. You know, big playoff energy. The Elias Pettersson Effect is real, the pieces are starting to fit, the future is coming into focus. Having them in a de facto 1-vs.-8 series against the Winnipeg Jets would be stellar.
These have been some brief words about the giant cluster is that is the Western Conference wild card race.

I wonder if people would get along with that Devils fan who has ""Fuggedaboutit"" on his jersey ...
An aside: If you asked 100 fans if Ubetcha was a Slovakian defenseman on the Wild, what percentage would say yes?
It's rare that Gary Bettman ever takes an 'L' during the collective bargaining process, but he's now 0-for-2 on getting the National Hockey League Players' Association to blink when he's dangled an international tournament in front of them.
He offered the players Olympic participation in exchange for an extension of the current CBA, which they summarily rejected in December 2018, with executive director Don Fehr saying the players showed ""no interest"" in the trade-off.
The Hurricanes and Wild pulled off a one-for-one trade. Which team came out ahead? We grade both GMs on the swap.
The NHL trade season is underway. Get caught up on the assets, restrictions and potential moves for every team ahead of the Feb. 25 deadline.
We update our picks on who will be vying for the Cup. Plus, non-goalie MVPs and fatal flaws for Nashville, Winnipeg, Toronto and Tampa Bay.
This time, Bettman and the NHL established a false deadline of January to determine whether or not the World Cup of Hockey would be held in 2020. Again, the players weren't playing his reindeer games, and the World Cup was scuttled for that year.
In speaking to some players in the last week, this is all about trust, as in the players have little of it for the owners and Bettman. Steven Stamkos told me that there wasn't ample time for the players to discuss how the World Cup would be used as a ""bargaining chip"" by the NHL, after Bettman already weaponized Olympic participation.
John Tavares echoed the concerns of the NHLPA as a whole, asking for a full schedule of upcoming international ""best on best"" events in an effort to take them away as pressure points for the NHL: the World Cup, the Olympics and potentially a Ryder Cup series for the NHL. ""Obviously, with what's coming up [with the CBA], it's one step at a time. Setting up an international schedule with multiple [events] is what would be ideal,"" he said.
Good luck with that.
Bettman is going to continue to dangle as many carrots as he can in front of the players, and none of it is going to work. First, because they don't trust him. But also because a lot of them are really, really angry over the league ""taking the Olympics away from them,"" as Stamkos put it.
Well, some of them, at least.
In reporting on this story, I was taken aback by how much Auston Matthews did not care in the slightest about the CBA negotiations.
Yes, he's 21. No, he's neither the first nor the last young star to take a nonchalant and nihilistic approach to labor issues. He's going to sign a massive, massive contract with lockout-protected bonuses. It's his third season in the league. It probably doesn't feel like his fight yet.
But it should be, because it's players like Matthews that really need to be strong voices in this process. Connor McDavid, in contrast, seems ready for a fight. As he told Emily Kaplan last year: ""This CBA is the one that is going to affect me the most,"" the 21-year-old McDavid said. ""We are at a time where the league is as young as it has ever been. There are a lot of star players that are young. If we can stand together, we're the ones that owners are going to have to face for a long time.""

While Che McDavid gets revolutionary in Edmonton, Matthews reacted to questions about the CBA this week like someone asked him a question about quantum physics, recoiling and declaring he's not the guy to ask.
Imagine if a coalition of young star players took up the fight with the veterans on some of these issues? The NHLPA might be something more than a fragile coalition staring down the unflappable Bettman at the negotiating table.

25739723,"NHL-leading Tampa Bay also got a 2019 seventh-round draft pick from Chicago in exchange for defenseman Slater Koekkoek and a fifth-round selection in this year's draft.
The NHL trade season is underway. Get caught up on the assets, restrictions and potential moves for every team ahead of the Feb. 25 deadline.
The 28-year-old Rutta had two goals and four assists in 23 games with the Blackhawks this season. He also has spent time in the minors.
Koekkoek was selected by Tampa Bay with the 10th pick in the 2012 draft. The 24-year-old Koekkoek has 5 goals and 9 assists in 85 career NHL games.

25795996,"""I just knew I had to go home to find myself again,"" Berglund said of his decision last month that caused the Sabres to terminate the final three-and-a-half years left on his contract.
After being suspended for failing to report to the Sabres, forward Patrik Berglund has cleared waivers and stands to lose $9.85M over the final three years of his deal.
The Sabres acted after suspending Berglund on Dec. 15 when he failed to report for the game at Washington.
He provided no indication regarding his future plans and said he's not concerned about walking away from the remainder of his five-year, $19.25 million contract.
""My contract, and all the money I gave up, means nothing,"" Berglund said. ""I can give up that amount at any time to feel good inside.""
In the article, Berglund said he lost some of his passion for hockey last summer after being traded to Buffalo by St. Louis, where he spent 10 seasons after being selected in the first round by the Blues in 2006.
Berglund, who apologized to the Sabres, said he had difficulty handling the move, and eventually became tired of trying to hide his frustrations.

2570754,"All of that training, however, came with a sacrifice: He didn't work his butt off at all. Actually, his lower half became too big to fit into most pants.
""Can it be hard for me to find pants? Yes, always,"" McDavid says. ""The waist, you need to get around your thighs and butt, but that doesn't always match how tall you are. I definitely have a hard time finding jeans that fit.""
He's hardly alone. ""I have had trouble,"" Dallas Stars captain Jamie Benn says. ""I just need to find the right company. Jeans are the hardest.""
This week's episode makes some ESPN On Ice history. To incorporate the voice of the listener, Greg Wyshynski and Emily Kaplan opened up the phone lines to field great hockey questions from our loyal fan base. Plus, find out if we get stumped by this week's ""Sach Got Your Number."" And Linda Cohn advises what the New York Rangers should do in the way of future front-office moves. Listen »
Penguins forward Zach Aston-Reese forgot to bring jeans on a road trip earlier this season. So while the team was in Ottawa, Aston-Reese ventured to the Levi's store. That's when he received a call from teammate Derek Grant. ""Are you still shopping?"" Grant asked. ""Can you buy me a pair?""
""Sure,"" Aston-Reese said. ""What size?""
""34,"" Grant said.
""No way!"" Aston-Reese replied.
Aston-Reese is technically a 34 waist himself, but he always buys a size 36 ""because my butt won't fit in a 34,"" he says. ""Derek is bigger than me,"" Aston-Reese adds. ""So there we are, having an argument in the Levi's store, because I was sure I was right.""
Several NHL players express their struggles with finding a pair of jeans that fits properly.
Not everyone fits into the same exact mold, making the sweet spot for size unique for every player.
""I've never really talked about it,"" Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews says. ""But it's definitely a thing a lot of guys go through.""
""It's an absolute nightmare between the quads and the glutes,"" Montreal Canadiens center Max Domi says. ""The glutes especially, because it just throws off your waist. You have, like, a 48 waist with your ass, but without it, you're a 32. So what do you do? Meet halfway, and you still have all this extra stuff.""
New York Islanders winger Anders Lee often goes to the mall with his wife. ""I'll try on, like, 40 pairs of pants or jeans,"" he laments, ""and we'll walk away with one ... or none. Oh, and anything that says 'skinny'? Trust me, I'm not getting into that.""
Postgame analysis and highlight show airing each night throughout the season from Barry Melrose and Linda Cohn. Watch on ESPN+
Last month, Blackhawks defenseman Connor Murphy spent an off day at Bloomingdale's. He tried on about 10 pairs of jeans and none of them fit. ""I got so mad, I hate shopping,"" Murphy says. ""But the saleswoman was really helpful and spent a lot of time with me, so I literally bought a pair because I felt bad for her -- even though they didn't fit and I knew I was going to return them later. I just had guilt.""
""There's definitely some pants I can't really fit into,"" says reigning league MVP Taylor Hall of the Devils. ""Some shorts that maybe fit my waist but don't fit the other parts. It's a challenge. You want to have big legs in hockey. You want to be a guy who skates well and uses his power, for sure. But that means ...""
We'll finish Hall's thought: If your body makes you good at your job, it provides bad luck in the dressing room (of a department store, that is).
This might be a new phenomenon, coinciding with the evolution of hockey players' training and, therefore, their physiques. Domenico Vacca is the personal tailor to upward of 250 NHL players and some coaches. Since the 1980s, he has been flying around North America creating custom suits cut from his own fabric for some of the game's biggest stars.
""It's a lot different now than it used to be,"" Vacca says. ""When I started, it was all about the upper body. The upper body was very big. Now, maybe six or seven years ago, I noticed the guys are all bigger in the thighs.""
This make's Vacca's job especially important because the trend now is a tapered look. In the '90s, players would have a baggy 27 inches around the knee. Now it's more like 17 or 18.
Finding the right tailor is one way to go. Before Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Jack Johnson discovered his brand of choice, Banana Republic, he says he would buy pants with ""a waist so big that they'd get over my thighs, then get them tailored to the point where my back pockets were, like, touching. It looked ridiculous.""
Football is king in the Cotton State, but from Huntsville to Birmingham and, yes, Tuscaloosa, there are many puckheads to be found.
The star winger has his Flames in first place, and he's on pace to shatter his previous career highs. We check in with the New Jersey native.
Only two goalies have won the Hart Trophy as MVP this millennium. Here's why the Ducks goalie should be No. 3, plus updates on all the other award races.
As for the larger-thigh phenomenon, it becomes more pronounced once a player gets to the NHL. For example, Vacca outfitted one player for the NHL draft in 2014. He recently visited that player to get him fitted for a new suit. ""His upper body is the same, almost exactly the same measurements at the top,"" Vacca says. ""His thighs were up an inch, and his hips were up two-and-a-half inches.""
Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone. If you've ever stood next to Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, you'll notice he's quite tall (6-foot-2) but slight. ""I am fine buying pants,"" he says. ""No problem.""
Goalies have different needs. As for the men skating in front of him?
""I used to have to get the husky pants when I was a kid,"" Boston Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy admits. ""Actually, once I became a Bruin, when I became a pro hockey player and had some walk-around money, then I discovered the jeans that were really soft, and they really fit to you. I got a couple pairs of those. But I just didn't wear jeans in college. I was a big sweatpants guy in college. Just Champion sweatpants. I roomed with Jordan Greenway -- he's a big boy -- and we would just wear sweatpants every day. We were the sweatpants and sweatshirts room.""
Once players start to have more disposable income, they find some brands that work. McDavid and Benn swear by Paige denim, which is known to use stretchier material, though an average pair retails for $199. McDavid also discovered an Ottawa-based brand, Heritage 34, this summer. Florida Panthers center Vincent Trocheck is a Diesel guy. Norwegian-born Blackhawks winger Andreas Martinsen found a Swedish brand he liked. So he bought pairs in black, and blue, and another shade of blue ....
But not everything has to be too pricey, as long as one is willing to experiment. Once Philadelphia Flyers captain Claude Giroux discovered the chain Zara, he found a sense of relief. ""I have smaller calves, too, for some reason,"" Giroux says. ""Zara, their suits fit me perfectly for some reason, so I'm there often. That's the one place I can shop.""
Those who aren't lucky enough to find a brand that works must resort to the more expensive option. ""Over the last three years, I realized I could get it custom,"" veteran Minnesota Wild center Eric Staal says. ""If you include the suits, I've spent a couple thousand, for sure."" Anaheim Ducks defenseman Josh Manson usually buys size 36 pants at the store, which is too big for his waist, but he gets everything else tailored.
""Every pair of pants I have is custom,"" Domi says. ""Whether it's jeans, joggers ... actually, I can get away with sweatpants, but that's it.""
A few smart businesses have cornered the niche market.
Leo Tropeano is a former soccer player who noticed that most jeans are built on the bell curve for the ""average guy."" He consulted with 2010 Hobey Baker winner Blake Geoffrion and realized hockey players were even more disproportionate. Two years ago, Tropeano launched the Chicago-based Mugsy Jeans. Although the ""custom denim that allows for flexibility"" isn't directly catered to hockey players, Tropeano has noticed that's who has latched on most. He says about five out of every 10 people who come into the Chicago storefront end up being ""hockey guys."" It's no coincidence that Mugsy advertises on the popular ""Spittin Chiclets"" podcast.

The Canadian brand GongShow is even more overt. ""The hockey world is really small. Everyone knows everyone,"" says founder and CEO Ger McNamee, a former junior hockey player. ""Guys would come home in the summer, and if you noticed someone had a good-fitting pair of jeans, we'd all ask where they got it. If a guy found a pair, he'd order 10 to 12 pairs.""
GongShow was founded in 2002 and proudly boasts the world's first pair of ""hockey jeans."" The pants are a little looser in the thighs, have more area in the butt, and mix in a little spandex to be more forgiving. ""They're built for the hockey ass,"" McNamee says. The biggest pair of jeans GongShow offers is called the Quadrasaurus. The company has partnered with the CWHL, and in talking to women's players, it realized that finding properly fitting jeans isn't a gender-specific issue. The company launched a women's line last year.
Hockey players aren't alone. McNamee found that a slew of athletes from other sports -- downhill skiers, speed skaters and some weightlifters -- have the same problem finding pants.
Which brings us back to McDavid. As exceptional as he is at so many aspects of hockey -- on an unattainable level for most -- his struggle to find pants actually gives him comfort. It's one area where he's relatively normal.
""At least I know I'm not alone,"" he says.

He joins goalie Antti Raanta, forwards Nick Schmaltz, Michael Grabner, Christian Fischer, and defenseman Jason Demers out with injuries.
Richardson, who was limited to 16 games in 2016-17 because of injuries, has 11 goals and five assists in 40 games this season.

Gaudreau is on pace to shatter previous career highs with 119 points (his previous high was 84) and 48 goals (30), as he fires off more shots than ever, shoulders more attention from opposition, and emerges as a legitimate Art Ross Trophy threat and under-the-radar MVP candidate.
As if things couldn't get any better, the sports scheduling gods are smiling upon Gaudreau, too. The Flames' trip to Chicago coincided with Gaudreau's beloved Philadelphia Eagles facing the Chicago Bears in a playoff game at Soldier Field. Calgary had booked ice time Sunday but nixed practice. Instead Gaudreau, along with linemates Sean Monahan and Elias Lindholm as well as winger Matthew Tkachuk, scored tickets to the game.
""I had tried to buy a jersey when we were in Philly, but luckily Johnny bought us all Eagles toques,"" Lindholm says. After watching warm-ups at field level, the group settled in their seats where, according to Lindholm, they enjoyed anonymity. That is, until Chicago's double-doink field goal miss gave the Eagles an astounding victory.
""I don't think many people around me in the stadium were very happy with my celebration,"" Gaudreau admits, sheepishly.
""It was a little awkward,"" Lindholm says. ""But Johnny was loving it.""
And OK, not everything's coming up Gaudreau. Since the 25-year-old had to stay until the end of the game, leaving the stadium was logistically brutal, he says, as there was ""a lot of traffic"" heading back to the team hotel. If nothing else, it's a reminder: Despite his on-ice heroics, in a lot of ways, Gaudreau is an everyman.
Had Gaudreau been born four years later, he probably wouldn't have slipped to the fourth round of the draft; he was taken 104th overall in 2011. Gaudreau's superstar ascent rides parallel to the NHL's transformation into a faster, less brutish game as teams have accepted that small stature is not necessarily a hindrance. That wasn't the case when Gaudreau was coming of age as a prospect.
Football is king in the Cotton State, but from Huntsville to Birmingham and, yes, Tuscaloosa, there are many puckheads to be found.
Johnny Gaudreau, Amanda Kessel and Kaapo Kakko had big weeks, but the Blues goalie takes the prize.
Only two goalies have won the Hart Trophy as MVP this millennium. Here's why the Ducks goalie should be No. 3, plus updates on all the other award races.
For the 2011 draft midterm rankings from NHL Central Scouting, Gaudreau was slotted as the No. 209 non-goalie prospect in North America -- on a 210-man list. Then listed at 5-foot-6, 137 pounds, Gaudreau was deemed too small and too slight. In 2012, he was cut from Team USA's 2012 World Juniors Championship roster.
Gaudreau (now listed at 5-foot-9, 165 pounds) found a way to produce at every level. With 72 points in 60 games for the Dubuque Fighting Saints, the 17-year-old Gaudreau was not only the USHL Rookie of the Year in 2010-11, but an All-Star. At Boston College, he won the Hobey Baker Award as the top men's player in NCAA hockey. The legend of Johnny Hockey grew.
In the NHL, Gaudreau didn't record a point in his first six games -- then worked his way into the All-Star Game as a rookie in 2014-15. In a story that encapsulates hockey players' inherent modesty, Gaudreau trademarked the term ""Johnny Hockey"" in both Canada and the U.S in 2014. His agent told TSN at the time that they ""were concerned that people were going to abuse the Johnny Hockey name, coming out with Johnny Hockey shirts and stuff and we wanted to make sure that did not occur."" Four years later, Gaudreau has not leveraged the nickname into any significant mainstream endorsements.
Of course, Gaudreau is only one part of Calgary's renaissance season. The Flames -- off to their best start since 1988-89, when they last won the Stanley Cup -- boast four players who rank in the top 20 in league scoring (the most of any team) as Gaudreau's linemates Monahan and Lindholm have shined with 1.23 and 1.14 points per game, respectively. The trio even captivates while sitting on the bench, because of their obsession with purple Gatorade and superstitious insistence that Gaudreau must squirt the bottle into both of his teammates' mouths.
""I'm not even sure when that started,"" Lindholm says. ""It's funny that so many people caught on.""
Gaudreau's shot volume is up big-time this season; he's on pace for 269, about 70 above his career average. Last March, Gaudreau's father suffered a cardiac event and the team allowed Gaudreau to fly home to New Jersey for a few days to be with him. When Gaudreau returned, his father (a longtime high school coach) instructed his son to shoot more. While that might be at the back of his mind, Gaudreau attributes his increased volume to the team's offseason trade with the Carolina Hurricanes that brought him a new linemate in Lindholm.
""Last year I played with Michael Ferland, and he's a little bit more of a shooter,"" Gaudreau says. ""Lindholm obviously is a shooter as well, but he can see the ice really well and he can make some pretty high-end plays. So I've gotten more opportunity to shoot a little more with a player like that.""
Gaudreau's status as a shifty perimeter playmaker with smooth hands and sick stickhandling is well established. Coach Bill Peters says Gaudreau's biggest strides this season have come from his play away from the puck.
""I don't know if he shows it that much, but he's really competitive,"" Flames captain Mark Giordano says. ""He's really feisty out there sometimes. I think he's one of the best because he really wants to be the guy in those situations, a lot like Patrick Kane. They have the same vision, the same sort of skills, and those type of players want the puck in key situations.""
The Kane comparison came up a lot as the Flames visited Chicago this week. Peters likened the two players, and Gaudreau admitted he spent a lot of time admiring Kane before he got into the league. It's apt, really, as the Blackhawks are rebuilding, the Flames are surging, and the 30-year-old Kane makes way for the next generation of American stars, a group of which Gaudreau is certainly one of the headliners.

25728343,"It's not necessarily near the top of the checklist for most teams, but having a second option in net that's somewhere between perfectly serviceable and legitimately reliable is something that has progressively evolved from luxury to borderline necessity. A good backup goalie in today's game is one of those things that you don't really appreciate the importance of until you don't have it, at which point it might be too late.
So which teams have done the best jobs of finding two reliable goalies? Which teams have an imbalance in one direction or the other? Who isn't getting good netminding from anyone this season?
With the modern advancements in and embrace of sports science in hockey circles, teams seem to have wised up to the dramatic effects that fatigue can have on goalie performance. Long gone are the days where we'd see Martin Brodeur and Miikka Kiprusoff routinely starting all but a handful of their team's games.
Last season no one started more than 67 games, and this season Marc-Andre Fleury is the only one whose pace is even close to approaching 70. Most No. 1 goalies are now firmly entrenched in the ballpark of 60 to 65 appearances in a given season, just as importantly almost never being asked to shoulder the load for both legs of a back-to-back scenario anymore.
We've come so far on this particular subject that when the Edmonton Oilers trotted Cam Talbot out for a whopping 73 appearances in 2016-17 (and another 13 playoff starts on top of that), it was publicly ridiculed as borderline malpractice on their part. It's impossible to say how much that workload was responsible for it, but he has been a shell of himself ever since.
Just because there's now a new accepted norm for how goalie starts should be split up doesn't mean that it has been a seamless transition for all. Teams are still trying to figure out how to walk the tightrope of optimizing their chances of winning on the occasions their starter does get a night off, without derailing their goalie prospects' development by having them sit on the bench all night.
With so few chances for the prospects to play, proportionally speaking, NHL teams have typically erred on the side of caution when it comes to calling those prospects up, instead preferring to get them more reps in the AHL. While that makes sense, it has resulted in a recycling of suboptimal veteran backups around the league, meaning that there are many instances where teams are using a goalie because he is a known commodity even if he isn't necessarily the best puck-stopping option available to them. Considering how tight the standings are, the margin for error is exceedingly small, and throwing valuable points away on those occasions is a tough pill to swallow.
Some teams have expertly found a way to have their cake and eat it too, while others have mightily struggled to string together enough of those secondary quality starts. And then there are the teams that have a bit of a power struggle going on, where they might need to reconsider who their best option really is. Here's a breakdown of that for each team, with the starter's save percentage on the x-axis and the backups on the y-axis. Note that the ""starter"" tag for each team has been designated to the goalie who has started the highest number of games for them this season:
The top right quadrant is where you want to be on this chart. Six teams -- the Bruins, Penguins, Stars, Islanders, Sabres and Ducks -- have separated from the pack when it comes to always having the benefit of top-flight netminding regardless of who's playing.
We've already talked enough about John Gibson's unparalleled heroics in this space this season. Ryan Miller was actually very good himself in limited appearances for the Ducks before he went down with an injury, which is why they appear here, but the Ducks still rely significantly more on their starter than any of those others do. Anaheim will go as far as Gibson can carry the team this season, and not a single step further.
The Stars and Islanders are both either currently sitting in a playoff spot or right on the bubble largely due to where they land on this chart. Despite the fact that both teams are hovering around the 50 percent threshold for expected goals and have relatively pedestrian underlying shot share profiles overall, they're getting quality goaltending every night, regardless of who's in net.
The drawback to a muscular posterior? It's tough to find a pair of jeans that will fit. Connor McDavid and other NHL stars chronicle the struggle.
The Lightning and Leafs maintain the top spots, with big movers elsewhere. Plus, which teams will finish above or below their current pace?
Football is king in the Cotton State, but from Huntsville to Birmingham and, yes, Tuscaloosa, there are many puckheads to be found.
The Isles' combination of Thomas Greiss and Robin Lehner has been good for fourth in goals against per 60 minutes and second best in save percentage. The Dallas duo of Ben Bishop and Anton Khudobin has given up the fifth-fewest goals and is currently sporting a league-best adjusted save percentage. All four are north of .920 for the season in save percentage, which is rather remarkable during a season in which the league average is below .910 for the first time in a decade. Any way you slice it, they've all been nothing short of fantastic, and aside from maybe Bishop, it's fair to say that none of them entered the season with any sort of real expectations or hype.
Being able to alternate goalies without any discernible drop-off has provided a massive competitive advantage to the two teams thus far, and will surely be even more valuable in the later stages of the season when injuries and fatigue begin to take an even bigger toll across the league.
That may be of particular importance to the Sabres, who are asking Carter Hutton to wade into personally uncharted waters this season. He has been excellent in his first season in Buffalo, but he's already nearing a career high in starts at this level with three months still to go. He's at 28 right now, which is the second most he has ever played, behind the 34 starts he made for the Predators in 2013-14. You could make the argument that means he has less tread on the tires than your typical 33-year-old goalie, but it's still tough to ask a goalie to play this much more than he ever has before while maintaining his current effectiveness.
The Penguins are interesting because they haven't taken the smoothest path toward getting to this point. They came into the season expecting Matt Murray to be their workhorse starter, but after he stumbled out of the gate with an .893 save percentage in October and .850 in November, they needed to turn to Casey DeSmith to carry them.
DeSmith been surprisingly stellar all year, stopping 92.4 percent of the shots he has faced and sitting 10th in goals saved above average at 7.12, just ahead of Pekka Rinne. Since returning from injury in December, Murray has looked much more like the goalie we'd come to expect during his dominant postseason runs, stopping a sparkling 96.3 percent of the shots he has faced in eight games during that time. If he keeps playing that way, he'll surely relegate DeSmith to the backup role they'd initially envisioned for him, which would be a great problem for Pittsburgh to have.
Similarly, the Bruins presumably want Tuukka Rask to be their starter, but thus far he has been outplayed by Jaroslav Halak. Halak's 12.27 goals saved above average is second to only Gibson this season, as both Halak and Greiss have shown that last year's dip in play was more indicative of the Islanders team in front of them than their own individual abilities. It'll be fascinating to see whether they Rask and Halak continue splitting starts evenly down the middle moving forward, and whether a goalie controversy eventually bubbles up if Rask once again struggles in the playoffs. That may ultimately be a moot point though, because it's quite possible that Halak's help shouldering the regular-season workload will result in a Rask who is fresher than he has been in the past come the postseason.
The bottom left quadrant is the one you don't want to find yourself in, so it should come as no surprise that that's where the Flyers show up. Brian Elliott was decent for them while he was healthy in the early going, but despite the fact that he has technically started the most games for them, they've had to split 30 of the other 43 games among six other goalies.
The carousel of Cal Pickard, Anthony Stolarz, Carter Hart, Michal Neuvirth, Alex Lyon and Mike McKenna combined to stop a stunningly low 87.4 percent of the shots they've faced in that time, and that 30th-ranked goaltending is ultimately the biggest reason why the Flyers have gone from playoff team last season to 30th in the standings and 31st in goal differential.

The same ultimately goes for the Senators, but in their case it's tough to place the full blame on the goalies because they've been thrust into such a dreadful situation. The 37.1 shots per game that they're conceding isn't just the highest total in the league, it's the most porous defensive effort we've seen since the expansion 1974-75 Washington Capitals, and the fifth worst all time.
They're so bad defensively that they make last season's Islanders look like the neutral-zone-trapping New Jersey Devils, which is saying something, because that team seemed to have no clue what it was doing in its own zone. Still, the .882 save percentage from the Senators four goalies not named Craig Anderson certainly isn't helping cover for those mistakes. It's tough to imagine that things could possibly get worse in that regard, but if they do wind up trading Mark Stone, one of the best defensive forwards in the game, that's exactly what'll happen.
We're rapidly approaching trade season, and a name we'll presumably see attract a ton of interest will be Red Wings starter Jimmy Howard. This summer's free-agent goalie class is highlighted by Sergei Bobrovsky and Semyon Varlamov, but considering that the Blue Jackets and Avalanche view themselves as playoff teams at the moment, it's unlikely that we see either dangled as trade bait. With the Red Wings headed for the lottery, that makes Howard even more enticing to a contender as the next-best rental option that's readily available. On his part, Howard has done wonders for his trade value despite the very pronounced lack of support in from of him. It has been some time since he managed to be both healthy and good in the same season -- you'd have to go all the way back to the 2012-13 lockout-shortened campaign, when he had a .923 save percentage while starting 42 of the team's 48 games -- which makes this bounce back particularly well-timed.
His .916 save percentage isn't jaw-dropping by any means, but it's important to consider the context. In today's league it's well above average, but it's especially impressive given the team in front of him. Playing behind the same defense, Jonathan Bernier has been an absolute mess between the pipes for the Red Wings. The gap in performance between the two is among the largest of any starter and backup in the league, which might not actually be the worst thing in the world for Detroit.
For a team that's firmly in the asset-collection phase of their rebuild, anything the Red Wings are able to get for Howard at the deadline is found money in and of itself. But beyond that, once they trade him they'll presumably fall even further down the standings and improve their lottery odds in the process, because he has been one of the few things keeping them competitive in the first half of the season. Bernier being on the books for another two years after this one isn't particularly palatable, but it's likely going to be a couple of seasons before they're realistically able to compete again regardless of what they do. Using this as an opportunity to load up on high draft picks isn't the worst way to go about building things back up.
Goaltending can be volatile and unpredictable at times, but it's awfully tough to consistently win without good netminding. As such, it's not particularly surprising to see that a common thread among the top teams in the league is that they're mostly all set in net. Of the bunch in the upper echelon, there's only two that have legitimate questions yet to be answered; conveniently enough, they're both in the Pacific Division.

The Flames are putting together an intriguing case to be taken seriously as not only a viable contender to come out of their own division, but actually challenge the top teams in the Central for Western Conference supremacy. Only the Lightning have been scoring more goals this season, and it checks out because the Flames' offensive attack, led by Hart Trophy candidate Johnny Gaudreau, looks totally legit.
For them to ultimately take that next step in going from exciting team to real contender though, they really need to hope that David Rittich can keep up this level of play, and need to stop playing Mike Smith under any circumstances.
Rittich has been great this season, quickly wrestling the starting gig away from the incumbent without any shadow of a doubt. He's sporting a .921 save percentage in 25 games. His 6.42 goals saved above average is 13th best in the league, which is actually brought down by special-teams performance because his 10.42 goals saved at 5-on-5 are second to only John Gibson. The issue is that he had only 22 NHL games under his belt prior to this season, and before that all the data we had on him came from the underwhelming Czech league and limited AHL appearances.
In cases like this, it's fair to be cautious and have reservations until we see a player like him continue to do it over a larger sample. To Rittich's credit, he has been passing all of the required tests every step of the way with flying colors. Still, regardless of your level of confidence in him moving forward, it'd make plenty of sense for the Flames to explore bringing in a more reliable second goalie option to avoid entirely burning him out. For as little information as we have about how good Rittich really is, we have plenty to reliably say that Mike Smith is cooked at this point.
Of 72 qualified goalies this season the -11.73 goals saved above average rate for Jake Allen is the only one worse than Smith's -11.29. If you stretch it back to the final two months of last season, when Smith came back from an injury, he has stopped just 88.5 percent of the near 1,000 shots he faced in those 35 games. He has quickly become a liability every time the Flames play him, and the sooner they accept it the better for everyone involved. For those who remember his glory days, it has been sad watching Smith flop around while pucks sail past him in and into the net this season.
One final note: It's remarkable that the Sharks are as high up the standings as they are despite the goaltending that they've received from both Martin Jones and Aaron Dell. San Jose is 31st in save percentage as a team at 5-on-5 and 29th in all situations. For some context, the other teams living in that neighborhood are the Senators, Flyers, Panthers and Blues, which speaks to both how instrumental goaltending is for team success and how dominant the Sharks have been in every other facet of the game.
Postgame analysis and highlight show airing each night throughout the season from Barry Melrose and Linda Cohn. Watch on ESPN+
The way the Sharks have managed to power through their goalie woes and avoid having it submarine their entire season has been admirable, instead using sheer volume of shots to swing the pendulum in their favor. Their 56.4 percent shot share is tops in the league, rivaled only by past seasons from Stanley Cup champions like the Red Wings, Blackhawks and Kings. Their 55.2 percent expected goals rate at 5-on-5 is third behind the Hurricanes and Lightning, and their power play is ranked seventh in goals generated per 60 minutes.
The biggest driver of that success has been Erik Karlsson, who has been playing at full throttle for a month now. There has been a lot made of his current scoring streak -- 25 points in 14 games will do wonders for capturing people's attention -- but the reality is that he has been his usual great self all season, even before the results caught up to the process.
With Karlsson on the ice this season at 5-on-5, the Sharks have controlled a staggering 60.1 percent of the shot attempts, 58.6 percent of the shots on goal, 54.4 percent of the actual goals and 60.7 percent of the expected goals. Now that he's all the way up to third in overall points for defensemen, it wouldn't be surprising to see his name getting mentioned once again in what's a wide-open Norris Trophy race this season.
But for the Sharks to finally take that big step and win the Cup with their current core intact, they're going to need more from Jones and/or Dell, or someone they acquire ahead of the trade deadline.

What to watch: The Bruins have been hoping to address their two nagging needs -- a top-six winger to establish their second line as a force in support of their first unit, as well as a third-line center -- through internal means. But as the deadline approaches, GM Don Sweeney might once again have to look outside the locker room for those solutions, as the Bruins are still searching for consistent secondary scoring.
Wayne Simmonds would seem like an obvious target: The Bruins need a left wing, and he provides a net-front presence and passes the Cam Neely truculence test. He's also an unrestricted free-agent rental. If winger Mark Stone and the Senators are at an end, the Bruins would likely pounce on him. Keep an eye on Mats Zuccarello of the Rangers as well, since Boston and New York have been active trading partners in the past.
To that end, Kevin Hayes would seem to address the B's need for another body in the middle. Brayden Schenn, if he's available from the Blues, could be an option as well, but Hayes has an expiring contract, while Schenn is signed through 2020.
Notes/restrictions:
The Bruins have roughly $3.8 million in cap space, via Cap Friendly.
Boston has all of its draft picks for the next three years, outside of its fourth- and seventh-rounders in 2019. The Bruins traded a first in the Rick Nash deal last deadline. Would Sweeney deal one again? ""I don't have a hard and fast rule, but by design I'd be hesitant to be doing it,"" he told WEEI.com.
Among the Bruins with no-move clauses are David Krejci, Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand, David Backes (!) and Zdeno Chara. Defenseman Torey Krug has a limited no-trade clause, submitting eight teams to whom he can't be dealt. Goalie Tuukka Rask has a limited no-trade clause as well, submitting a list of eight teams to whom he can be traded.

Our take: It didn't work out with Nash last season, but the Bruins should find another external solution to their top-six left wing problem at the deadline. Look at what they'll be facing in Tampa Bay, Toronto, Washington and Pittsburgh; secondary scoring is essential in this conference.
One great line doesn't make a Stanley Cup champion -- but it certainly doesn't hurt. We debate the top trios around the league.
The drawback to a muscular posterior? It's tough to find a pair of jeans that will fit. Connor McDavid and other NHL stars chronicle the struggle.
Football is king in the Cotton State, but from Huntsville to Birmingham and, yes, Tuscaloosa, there are many puckheads to be found.
What to watch: OK, so maybe the Sabres didn't bank enough points to guarantee a playoff spot (or, perhaps, that theory was always nonsense).
They're still very much in the postseason hunt, but the focus is clearly on two things going forward: pending unrestricted free agent Jeff Skinner, and whether or not he's going to be on Jack Eichel's wing for the long term. Talks are starting, and the asking price could be $8 million annually. What Skinner wants, and where he decides he wants to take his talents next season, will dictate what GM Jason Botterill does with him at the deadline.
There's going to be pressure, internally and externally, to become buyers this season. The Sabres have cap space and future assets to spend. But they also have a few players -- Vladimir Sobotka and Marco Scandella among them -- who go unrestricted in 2020 and could be flipped a year early.
Notes/restrictions:
The Sabres have their own picks in the next three years, save for their 2019 second-, fourth- and fifth-rounders, and their third- and sixth-rounders in 2020. If the Sharks make the playoffs, they can choose to keep their 2019 first-rounder and give Buffalo their 2020 first-rounder, or hand over their 2019 pick for signing Evander Kane. The Sabres also receive the Sharks' 2019 fourth-round pick, unless San Jose decides to keep it, in which case Buffalo gets a 2020 third-round pick instead. The Blues' first-rounder this season is top-10 protected, and Buffalo gets their 2020 first-round pick instead if they get a top-10 pick. The Sabres also have the Leafs' sixth-round pick in 2019 and the Blues' second-round pick in 2021.
Skinner has a no-move clause. Forwards Kyle Okposo (15-team no-trade list) and Jason Pominville (10-team no-trade list) have limited no-trade clauses.

Our take: Keep taking it slow and steady, and make the big splash in the summer. The Sabres will have cap space, assets and a much better understanding of what parts of their team to keep and what parts to jettison. Oh, and sign Skinner, for Jack's sake.
What to watch: For the third straight year, the Red Wings are sellers at the deadline, and they have some interesting pieces that could be for sale.
Gustav Nyquist is chief among them. The winger has been the second-best forward on the team this season, not coincidentally in a contract year. He has a no-trade clause -- it's Ken Holland, so of course he does -- that could gum up the works for a trade, but there would be a market for him.
Goalie Jimmy Howard has been terrific this season in 31 appearances, and by all accounts the Wings want him back for another tour of duty as he hits free agency this summer. Undoubtedly, teams would kick the tires on Howard if one of them loses their starting goalie, but otherwise how many contenders would ante up to add this kind of goalie to their depth chart?
Defenseman Trevor Daley is on the mend and has a no-trade clause. He's also signed through 2020. But when it comes to veteran depth defensemen, Daley would be a desirable option, especially for those looking to add the proverbial ""rings in the room.""
It wouldn't be an NHL trade deadline if Thomas Vanek wasn't at least mentioned. The 35-year-old winger, who has played for five teams since 2016, is a free agent this summer. He also has a no-trade clause -- again, it's Ken Holland, so of course he does.
Notes/restrictions:
The Red Wings have nearly a dozen players with trade protection: Nyquist, Justin Abdelkader, Darren Helm, Vanek, Mike Green, Danny DeKeyser and Daley all have no-trade clauses; Frans Nielsen (10 teams), Niklas Kronwall (10 teams) and Jonathan Ericsson (19 teams) all have modified no-trade clauses.
Detroit has all of its draft picks for the next three years, as well as the Islanders' second-rounder and the Sabres' and Coyotes' fifth-rounders in 2019, plus the Golden Knights' third-rounder in 2021.

Our take: Let's hope that someone comes to Ken Holland with the kind of overcompensation that Vegas gave them to rent Tomas Tatar. Otherwise, it's ""Lose for Hughes"" and hope to make a splash in the summer.
What to watch: It's unclear if this is a garage sale or a fire sale. A garage sale is a sale where you have items that you know have to go, but there's a nostalgic bond, so you're not exactly willing to drop the prices -- and sometimes you slowly move them back into the house. A fire sale ... well, everything must go! And considering where the Panthers are this season, as one of 2018-19's biggest disappointments, one wonders if it'll be the latter.
It's not an easy call, because the Panthers are an attractive team on paper. There are five skaters signed through at least 2022. Jonathan Huberdeau, Aleksander Barkov, Mike Hoffman, Evgenii Dadonov and Keith Yandle have all had solid offensive seasons. Injured Vincent Trocheck is a keeper. So are Aaron Ekblad and Mike Matheson on the back end. And yet, this is a team with 42 points through 45 games.
There are obvious calls at the deadline, like shipping out pending free agent Troy Brouwer for anything. Center Nick Bjugstad is signed through 2021 and really needs a refresh. Defenseman Mark Pysyk is under contract until 2020 and has value.
But will GM Dale Tallon take this opportunity to do something more dramatic (assuming this is Tallon's team going forward)?
Notes/restrictions:
Dadonov and Yandle have full no-move clauses. Hoffman has a list of 10 teams to which he can't be traded. Roberto Luongo has a five-team trade list through his modified no-trade clause.
The Panthers have all of their picks, save for their second- and third-rounders in 2019. They have either the Oilers' or Islanders' third-round pick this year, depending on which one is higher. They also have the Leafs' fifth-rounder in 2020.

Our take: There's no question that injuries and some down seasons are at the root of the Panthers' problems this season. But there are other issues, too, that are probably best solved in the summer, including some difficult conversations about the goaltending.
What to watch: Not only are the Canadiens in a playoff seed, but they're challenging for a divisional playoff spot -- which is nutty, especially when you consider how hot GM Marc Bergevin's seat was last year. But here we are.
And here's where Bergevin is: sitting on a bevy of draft picks with more than $9 million in cap space as Montreal approaches the trade deadline. In theory, the Canadiens should be buyers, as a playoff team and with cornerstones Shea Weber and Carey Price both north of 31. Shoot your shot, right?
But with so many young players on the roster and in the pipeline, not to mention those picks, should the Habs play the long game or swing for the fences? That seems to be where Bergevin is as the deadline approaches.
""I'm always going to be listening to options, but the goal is to build for the future. To give up assets for short-term [value], I'm not going to do it. It would have to be very appealing. If there's a young player available and there's assets that have to go, I get that. But I don't think I'll be in the rental business,"" Bergevin told The Athletic earlier this month. ""If I think it makes sense, I'll do it, but I'm not going to start mortgaging the future because I know what's coming, with the world juniors, who they're going to be asking for, and I'm not moving these kids. So it's going to be a short conversation.""
That said, pending restricted free-agent center Joel Arnia and unrestricted free-agent defenseman Jordie Benn could be on the way out, as the Canadiens sell off a few assets.
Notes/restrictions:
Defenseman Jeff Petry has a 15-team no-trade list, while fellow defenseman Karl Alzner had a seven-team list and, alas, no takers. Carey Price has a full no-move clause.
The Habs have all of their picks for the next three years outside of a fifth and a seventh this season. They own the Blue Jackets' second, the Flames' fourth, the Blackhawks' and Oilers' fifths, and the Jets' seventh this year; they own the Jets' fourth-rounder in 2020.

Our take: It doesn't appear that Bergevin has an appetite for rentals or for overpaying for a veteran. But if it's a young star player, it still sounds like he's going to shoot his shot. Ridiculous overpayment for Vladimir Tarasenko, anyone?
What to watch: The contract talks between the Senators and pending unrestricted free-agent forwards Matt Duchene and Mark Stone. Full stop.
OK, not a full, full stop. There's every chance that forwards Ryan Dzingel ($1.8 million and a pending UFA) and Magnus Pääjärvi ($900,000, pending UFA) and defenseman Cody Ceci ($4.3 million, a pending RFA and inexplicably valued by others) could be moved. But what Stone and Duchene decide will shape Ottawa's deadline. Both players would fetch a bounty. Or, both players could be cornerstones for the Senators' rebuild -- provided, you know, they want to stay.
Notes/restrictions:
Forward Bobby Ryan had a modified no-trade clause (10 teams) and a $7.25 million cap hit through 2022, which might as well be a no-move clause. Forward Zack Smith, whose $3.25 million average annual value through 2021 would be desirable, has a 10-team no-trade list; goalie Craig Anderson has a 10-team no-trade list.
The Senators infamously don't own their first-round pick this season (it was moved to Colorado as part of the Duchene trade and their decision to retain the No. 4 overall pick last summer). They also don't have their third- and sixth-rounders in 2019, or their fifth-rounder in 2020. They own either the Sharks' or Panthers' second-rounder in 2019, the Penguins' third-rounder in 2019, the Flames' 2019 seventh-rounder, the Sharks' first-rounder in either 2019 or 2020, and potentially the Sharks' first in 2022, if San Jose makes the Stanley Cup Final this season and re-signs Erik Karlsson. They also have the Sharks' sixth-rounder in 2020 and a conditional sixth-rounder from the Blues.

Our take: For the sake of Senators fans, hopefully they sign both players. Stone is legitimately one of the best two-way forwards in hockey, and Duchene seems motivated and happy in Ottawa.
What to watch: Seeing as how the best team in the NHL this season has been meticulously constructed for the better part of two seasons and has such limited room under the cap ceiling, it's hard to image the Lightning being all that active at the deadline outside of little deals like the recent Slater Koekkoek-for-Jan Rutta swap.
""I'll make a trade if there's one to be made. I don't know what that will be right now,"" GM Julien BriseBois told NHL.com.
Notes/restrictions:
If the Lightning win the Stanley Cup, that's good news for the Rangers, as their conditional second becomes a first rounder for New York. Other than that, the Lightning own all of their picks for the next three years outside of a fifth-rounder in 2019 that belongs to Chicago as part of the Koekkoek-Rutta deal.
Steven Stamkos and Victor Hedman have no-move clauses and are obviously not headed anywhere. Forwards Ondrej Palat, Tyler Johnson and Alex Killorn have no-trade clauses, while Ryan Callahan (16 teams) has a limited one. Defenseman Dan Girardi has a full no-trade clause, while Ryan McDonagh (10 teams), Anton Stralman (16 teams) and Braydon Coburn (16 teams) have limited no-trade clauses.

Our take: When you're 13 points clear of the next team in the conference with a goal differential of plus-56, there's not much you need to be in the market for at the deadline. But you know BriseBois and senior advisor Steve Yzerman will have their eyes open.

What to watch: The blue line. It's become an NHL cliché that defense will be the Leafs' undoing in the postseason if they don't upgrade the position, especially on the right side. But solving that issue at the deadline isn't going to be easy. The rental market is underwhelming. The trade market for players with term -- like, say, Alec Martinez from the Kings or Alex Pietrangelo of the Blues or any of the Hurricanes' right-handed shooting defensemen -- will cost the Leafs prospects from a pool that's not all that deep. Defensive prospect Timothy Liljegren has been mentioned as trade bait for an established player.
The Leafs can score with anyone up front, and Frederik Andersen has been simply outstanding as a last line of defense. But their maturation as a Cup contender greatly depends on what lies in between them and who arrives to bolster that group.
Notes/restrictions:
Forwards John Tavares and Patrick Marleau have full no-move clauses. Center Nazem Kadri has a 10-team no-trade list; defenseman Ron Hainsey has a 15-team no-trade list; and Andersen has a 10-team no-trade list.
The Leafs have all of their picks for the next three years, except their sixth-rounder in 2019 and their fifth-rounder in 2020. They have the Blues' fourth-rounder and a conditional seventh-rounder from Dallas in 2019, as well as conditional seventh-rounders from the Oilers and Sharks in 2020.
Our take: If a deal presents itself at the deadline for the impact defenseman (with contract term) that the Leafs need, they should take the leap. The window is open to win now, but the road likely goes through Boston and Tampa. The Leafs need more on the back end to advance out of their division, let alone to win the Stanley Cup.

What to watch: The Hurricanes are on the playoff bubble but possess what so many teams covet: a surplus of capable defensemen. And what do the Canes need? Some scoring help.
That makes Carolina an ideal trade partner for many teams this February. The Canes have long been fielding calls about their d-men. It is believed that Jaccob Slavin is absolutely untouchable. Many teams have inquired about 24-year-old Brett Pesce, but it doesn't seem like Carolina has any desire to move him, either. Justin Faulk (two years remaining on his contract, with $4.83 million annual cap hit) and Dougie Hamilton (three years remaining, $5.75 million cap hit) appear to be the more likely trade candidates; it's not an indictment of their play, but rather they're just the odd men out in a numbers game. Both would be able to drive a high price.
The team could also consider addressing goaltending at the deadline. And despite needing offense, they could be shipping one of their better forwards out. That would be Michael Ferland, who, despite ranking fourth among Carolina players in points, needs a new contract next summer, and it seems that management and his camp are far apart in asking price. Considering how cheap the winger is this season ($1.75 million), a plethora of teams will be interested.
Notes/restrictions:
Carolina has already stockpiled draft picks, with 25 picks over the next three drafts.
Goaltender Scott Darling, currently buried in the minors, has a 15-team no trade list. It's probably moot; there doesn't appear to be a market right now for the struggling netminder.
Both goalies on Carolina's current roster, Curtis McElhinney and Petr Mrazek, become unrestricted free agents this summer. Parma, Ohio, native Alex Nedeljkovic was the No. 37 overall pick in 2014 and has played 29 games for the AHL affiliate Charlotte Checkers, generating a 2.63 goals-against average and .905 save percentage.
Jordan Staal has a no-movement clause, and Justin Williams has a 15-team no-trade list.
Faulk is a likely trade candidate but gets some say in where he goes, with a 15-team no-trade list.
Carolina has been operating on a budget and has a boatload of cap space.

Our take: We appreciate the patient approach, but something needs to get done for this team to level up. The goaltending might be able to manage for the rest of the season, but this team won't make it far without scoring help. Move off one of the defensemen, trade away Ferland, but make sure there are solid roster players in return and not just a stockpile of draft picks. Adding Nino Niederreiter for Victor Rask is a good start.
What to watch: It's all about two big names for the Blue Jackets: Artemi Panarin and Sergei Bobrovsky. The two star players have expiring contracts, and their futures in Columbus are dubious.
Let's start with Bobrovsky, who is more likely to be traded. The two time Vezina Trophy winner is 30 and still has plenty in his tank. That's why he's looking for a long-term contract. His camp and Columbus were far away in initial talks, and the relationship has appeared to sour since then. Somebody is going to pay Bobrovsky this summer, and at this point, we'd be shocked if it's the Blue Jackets. Because of that, GM Jarmo Kekalainen may be tempted to recoup value now, even while the team is in the playoff hunt.
The team badly wants Panarin to re-sign, but he seems to want to test the open market (even if that might mean signing back in Columbus eventually). That makes his situation trickier. The Blue Jackets would like a commitment from Panarin around the All-Star weekend, and it's unclear if they're going to get it. They could keep him around as their own rental and hope he reconsiders. Or they could trade him; there's little precedent for a team sending away their best offensive player while still high in the playoff mix.
Columbus might look for other upgrades, like secondary scoring; Sonny Milano and Ryan Murray also have trade-chip potential.
Notes/restrictions:
Bobrovsky has a no-movement clause, but it seems likely that he would be willing to waive it (especially since it would be to a contender) considering his tenuous status in Columbus.
The Blue Jackets only have four picks (a first, third, fourth and seventh) in the upcoming draft. So in any trade, they'll try to acquire some draft capital back.
Cam Atkinson has a no-trade clause.
Nick Foligno and Brandon Dubinsky have 10-team no-trade lists.

Our take: Trade Bobrovsky now, because it has become very clear he's going to sign elsewhere in free agency. Hold on to Panarin, however. It would be very difficult for this team to advance far in the playoffs this season without him, and even if he doesn't give a firm verbal commitment, there's still a chance he may re-sign.
What to watch: The Devils were bound to regress from their 2017-18 surprise season, and it looks like they knew it. (That's how to explain coach John Hynes' contract extension while the team is struggling this season). There's still a lot to like about this roster, especially among the young players, and the top priority moving forward is signing reigning league MVP Taylor Hall to a contract extension; he's up for a new contract in summer 2020.
With little hope for this current season, especially as Hall has battled some mysterious injuries and goaltending has been a mess, the Devils could view the trade deadline as a time to reset and sell.
The Devils have quite a few players who hit UFA status this summer: Brian Boyle, Marcus Johansson, Keith Kinkaid, Ben Lovejoy, Drew Stafford and Egor Yakovlev. New Jersey could look to move any of these players to create room for a younger player. They also know that being flush with cap space this summer comes at a great time for what is shaping up to be a deep free-agent class. Johansson is the most attractive candidate on this list, but Lovejoy would draw interest, as defensemen with experience always tend to do. A team may look at Kinkaid for goaltending depth, but it appears his value has diminished recently.
Notes/restrictions:
Three of the team's oldest players, Andy Greene (36), Corey Schneider (32) and Travis Zajac (33) have no-trade clauses.
Marcus Johansson has a five-team no-trade list, and Kyle Palmieri has an eight-team no-trade list.
According to Cap Friendly, the Devils have the league's second-lowest project cap hit this season ($66 million). Only the Hurricanes are spending less.
The Devils hold draft picks in each of the seven rounds in each of the next three seasons.
New Jersey has not made a trade since its two moves around last year's deadline, to acquire wingers Pat Maroon and Michael Grabner.

Our take: It's not going to happen for New Jersey this season, so we'd like to see GM Ray Shero use the deadline to trade away a few players for assets. Goaltending needs to be addressed, but that can wait until the summer.
What to watch: The Islanders are great overachievers this season and still find themselves within the playoff hunt. GM Lou Lamoriello has a history of trading at the deadline in his previous stops, so it's not unreasonable to think that the Islanders will be active this February.
Lamoriello doesn't want to veer too far from his plan for building the team the right way; at the same, time, you cannot understate how important a playoff berth would be to the morale of this fan base.
Thanks to new coach Barry Trotz, the defense is in much better shape than we figured it would be. That's not to say this team couldn't benefit from a depth defenseman should one be available at the right price. The goaltending has also been a pleasant surprise, especially Robin Lehner, who was signed to a one-year prove-it deal. There's no pressing need to address goaltending at the deadline.
When it comes to scoring production, New York really drops off in its bottom six, and it's fair to wonder if this team might be in on a player like Gustav Nyquist. Or perhaps the team takes a long look at Charlie Coyle to address long-term depth at center.
The team faces a decision on Jordan Eberle, who becomes a UFA this summer. If he doesn't figure into long-term plans, do you trade him now (even if he does have value for a playoff push)?
Notes/restrictions:
New York does not have a third- or fourth-round pick in the upcoming draft.
Valtteri Filppula and Johnny Boychuk have no-movement clauses.
Leo Komarov has a seven-team no-trade list.
Three of New York's top five scorers become UFAs this summer: Anders Lee, Brock Nelson and Jordan Eberle.

Our take: We'd love to see the Islanders make one move that helps their chances of winning this year. The race for the final playoff spots is wide-open right now, so why not the Isles?

What to watch: It's been almost a year since Jeff Gorton and Glen Sather infamously issued a public letter to fans essentially admitting to a rebuild. Shortly after, the Rangers unlocked their roster and let teams (mainly the Lightning) pluck away some of the best talent -- at market price, of course. This trade deadline figures to be a repeat selling spree. The Rangers were pretenders early in the season but have since been exposed for what they are: raw and bereft of superstars, outside their goaltender.
The Rangers will be among the busiest teams fielding inquiries from hungry contenders. Winger Mats Zuccarello is almost guaranteed to go; despite being an overachieving fan favorite, he's 31 with an expiring contract and declining production, meaning he doesn't figure into the team's long-term plans. New York shouldn't expect much for him outside of middle-round draft picks. Fellow expiring contract Kevin Hayes, on the other hand, could command a decent bounty. He wants to stay and will be hard to replace, but his versatility is so attractive that other teams may offer too much for New York to refuse.
The real question is how many other Rangers are finding new homes? Will New York listen to offers on Chris Kreider (two years remaining on the contract, $4.625 million cap hit)? Are any teams interested in Vladislav Namestnikov? Ryan Strome? Brendan Smith? Really, few players are safe.
Notes/restrictions:
Defenseman Marc Staal and goaltender Henrik Lundqvist are the two longest-tenured players on the team, and both carry full no-movement clauses.
There has been some fan speculation about whether Lundqvist would waive that to get the chance to play for a contender and win a Stanley Cup, as his personal window closes. But he has been steadfast about staying thus far.
Kevin Shattenkirk has a 10-team no-trade list. Chris Kreider's list is 11 teams, while Brendan Smith's list is 15 teams.

Our take: If you say you're going to rebuild, then outline the rebuild, you have to follow up on the rebuild. The Rangers should be in the asset-acquiring business this winter, listen to all offers and trade as many players as they can.
What to watch: There's one big name on the Flyers' roster that everyone is monitoring: Wayne Simmonds.
The 30-year-old winger has expressed a desire to stay in Philadelphia, and there have been discussions about a contract extension. However, as February nears and nothing has been completed, it's becoming clear that the Flyers will need to cut ties. Compounding the issue: Simmonds could be the most-attractive rental on the market considering he possesses all the traits that contending teams covet in a winger (scoring touch, speed, effectiveness on the power play, toughness, a willingness to put his body in front of the net ... the list goes on).
The 2018-19 season, which has been defined by leadership turmoil, is a wash for these Flyers. New GM Chuck Fletcher has been patient in assessing the roster, but it's time to get something done so the team can reverse its direction next season. The only moves so far have been relatively minor: Jordan Weal for a sixth-rounder; acquiring even more goalies on the waiver wire. Couldn't there be something more drastic?
Notes/restrictions:
The Flyers don't get full autonomy when it comes to where they deal Simmonds; he has a 12-team no-trade list.
Claude Giroux is the only other player on the Philadelphia roster with trade protection. He has a full no-movement clause.
Philadelphia has one of the best prospect pools in the NHL and also holds each of its draft picks for each of the next three seasons, plus an extra third-rounder and seventh-rounder in 2019.

Our take: It feels as if Fletcher is ready to pounce on something big, and we're ready for it. Acquiring a goalie no longer feels as important with Carter Hart's emergence; rather, there needs to be a shakeup among skaters so next season can start better than this one.
What to watch: GM Jim Rutherford is a guy who is never satisfied. He's always looking for ways to improve his roster. Already this season, Rutherford (who was signed to a three-year extension in November) has orchestrated two deals involving regular roster players: the Carl Hagelin-for-Tanner Pearson swap followed by the Daniel Sprong-for-Marcus Pettersson deal.
Now the Penguins have begun to hit their stride and have played some excellent hockey. That probably lessens the urgency to get a move done, but never, ever rule out something big from Rutherford.
If the Penguins do make moves, what would they be in the market for? Justin Schultz is poised to return from his leg injury sometime after the All-Star break, and Pettersson has impressed in his short stint, but don't be shocked if Rutherford looks for more depth on the blue line. He might not view it as a luxury, but rather essential for a long playoff run. A middle-six scoring winger could also be in the mix. Would a player like Michael Ferland make sense (he carries a very low cap hit at $1.75 million and could play on either the left or right side)?
Notes/restrictions:
Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin have no-movement clauses but are not being moved anyhow.
Kris Letang and Derick Brassard have 18-team no-trade lists.
Phil Kessel has always been the subject of lingering trade rumors (though they have quelled lately). The winger has a eight-team no-trade list.
Patric Hornqvist also has an eight-team no-trade list.
The Penguins do not have a third-rounder or sixth-rounder in the upcoming draft. They are also without their second-rounder in 2020.
According to Cap Friendly, the Penguins are projected to have less than $5 million in cap space.

Our take: Unlike last year, when the Penguins felt they clearly needed depth at center and acquired Derick Brassard, there is no pressing need for the Penguins, especially if Schultz returns quickly and to form. He's already made the moves he has needed to this season, and the team is playing much improved hockey. He should stand pat.
What to watch: The reigning Stanley Cup champions have staved off the hangover thus far and might just be poised for another long playoff run. Washington spent the summer getting the band (mostly) back together, a strategy that seems to have paid off. Just as they did at last year's deadline, the Caps could be looking for small tweaks. (Washington acquired depth defensemen Jacob Jerebuk and Michal Kempny at low prices last February; the Kempny acquisition paid off big time.)
Last week, GM Brian MacLellan hinted at what he's thinking of, telling reporters, ""I think the only thing we're going to look for is, is there a hockey trade to be made, salary-for-salary, player-for-player in the forward group?""
If the Caps do send a player out, Andre Burakovsky is a good bet. The 23-year-old first-round pick has been a frequent healthy scratch and, despite flashing his potential for the Caps, he hasn't put up the regular production management has expected of him. Considering his status as an impending RFA, Washington might be inclined to just let go.
Notes/restrictions:
It's highly unlikely the Caps would move one of their core players, but Alex Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom, T.J. Oshie, John Carlson, Matt Niskanen and Braden Holtby all have lists ranging from seven to 15 teams to which they cannot be traded.
There's a reason MacLellan mentioned a trade would have to be player-for-player: The Caps do not have a lot of flexibility at all, with less than $1 million in cap space.
MacLellan has made two splashy trade deadline acquisitions in his tenure, and neither panned out: Kevin Shattenkirk in 2017 and Curtis Glencross in 2015.
Our take: Burakovsky is a player who could probably benefit from a change of scenery. If the Caps are wary of his restricted free agency this summer, they should find a taker for him now, ideally for a forward who can plug in to Washington's middle six. Other than that, no huge moves are necessary.

One great line doesn't make a Stanley Cup champion -- but it certainly doesn't hurt. We debate the top trios around the league.
The drawback to a muscular posterior? It's tough to find a pair of jeans that will fit. Connor McDavid and other NHL stars chronicle the struggle.
Football is king in the Cotton State, but from Huntsville to Birmingham and, yes, Tuscaloosa, there are many puckheads to be found.
What to watch: It's been a hectic few months for the Blackhawks, who -- after firing Joel Quenneville and promoting AHL coach Jeremy Colliton -- insist they are not in a rebuild, but rather are retooling. Stan Bowman is known as a general manager who is always working the phones, and he has made 23 separate trades since January 2017.
Most observers are waiting to see if Bowman will do something drastic this season; though it's still feasible the Blackhawks could make a push for the playoffs, logical convention says with a projected point total of 70, they're already out. What would be dramatic: if the Blackhawks moved one of their marquee-name players who made up the core for Chicago's three Stanley Cups (Duncan Keith, Brent Seabrook, Patrick Kane, Jonathan Toews and Corey Crawford). Each of those skaters carries a no-movement clause; Crawford's is a 10-team no-trade list. In a Dec. 16 conversation with ESPN, Bowman said he had not had any conversations with any of those players regarding waiving their clauses. ""At this time I don't anticipate having those conversations,"" Bowman said. ""Though of course things can change.""
Teams still certainly will call the Blackhawks. Bowman has had some luck with middle-tier trades lately (see: the Dylan Strome acquisition, getting the Oilers to bite on Brandon Manning's lamentable contract), so a likely scenario could be finding a taker for functional middle-six center Artem Anisimov.
Notes/restrictions:
Anisimov is the most likely Blackhawks player to be traded before the deadline, but the 30-year-old has a 10-team list of teams to which he cannot be traded.
Chris Kunitz, 35, has been a disappointing free-agent acquisition, though his one-year deal carries a full no-movement clause.
With the emergence of Collin Delia, the Blackhawks are less reliant on Cam Ward. However, the 34-year-old's mediocre performance plus $3 million cap hit make him a trade candidate only for truly desperate teams. Ward also has a no-movement clause, which he theoretically could waive if a contender was interested.

Our take: There's not much more Bowman can do to this roster in season if the big players (with the big cap hits) aren't going to waive their no-move clauses. He should continue making tweaks, make a small trade or two, then push a bigger reset button this offseason.
What to watch: The Avalanche are in a precarious spot. Yes, they've arrived ahead of schedule and have proved they can still hang among the playoff teams. But they're still raw, and declaring this is the year to be all-in might not make the most sense, considering how many teams remain in the mix. Plus, that would seem to be off-brand for GM Joe Sakic, who has preached patience with roster construction. It feels highly unlikely the Avs will be in the market for a potentially one-and-done rental like Artemi Panarin, Kevin Hayes or Wayne Simmonds. The last thing Sakic wants to do right now is trade away any of his promising young players.
Now, there are plenty of ways for this team to improve, and a glaring one is secondary scoring. It's a bit improved from the first-line-or-bust setup on last season's roster, but there's still a significant drop-off from Gabriel Landeskog, Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen to everyone else. Perhaps taking a flier on a middle-six winger like Andre Burakovsky makes sense, considering he's only 23 and becomes a restricted free agent this summer. So, theoretically, if he meshes well with the team, there's a chance to keep him around and it doesn't veer too far from the plan. A young defenseman (could this be the team that lands a player like Dougie Hamilton?) would help too.
Since this team will be wary of trading future assets, one player who could be on the move is goaltender Semyon Varlamov, considering Philipp Grubauer is in the wings and veteran goaltending help could be of use for some buyers.
Notes/restrictions:
Carl Soderberg has a 10-team no trade list while Gabriel Landeskog and Erik Johnson have 19-team no trade lists. No other players on the Colorado roster have any trade protection.
Colorado has a ton of draft capital. They have each of their picks in rounds one through three in each of the next three years, including two first-round picks in 2019 and two third-round picks in 2019.
The Avalanche could trade their own first-round pick in 2019, but they'll want to hold on to the one they acquired from the Senators. Considering how Ottawa's season has panned out, that pick should be very high and could potentially land either Jack Hughes or Kaapo Kakko -- an in-house answer for secondary scoring help in 2019-20 and beyond.
The Avalanche have plenty of cap space available. They'll need to give Rantanen a new contract this summer, but there's still ample space to go around.

Our take: It would be prudent for Sakic to acquire some scoring help for his over-burdened top line ... as long as the Avs aren't giving up too much. This isn't the year to mortgage the future and go-all in. The team is simply too raw still and there are too many holes.
What to watch: Oh, what to make of the Stars? The team is still transitioning to new coach Jim Montgomery, is playing inconsistent hockey, is struggling to score -- and the star players have been called out in a profane rant by the team's CEO. And yet, it looks like Tyler Seguin is turning it around, and they're bubbling under the playoff cutoff. The quintessential question for GM Jim Nill: Is this really the year to go all-in? (And also, how does his job security factor into any decisions he makes?)
There's no question that upgrades could help, especially in the top-six forward department.
Nill excused himself from any irrational spending at last year's deadline; a midseason acquisition may not have changed the complexion of the season, but you have to wonder if things might have ended differently. The Stars, who were in playoff position for nearly 80 percent of the season, floundered down the stretch, including a six-game winless ""road trip from hell"" that cost them a playoff spot.
If the Stars are trending up and are in mix for a top-three spot in the Central Division, they'll want to add scoring help for a playoff push. Gustav Nyquist and Mats Zuccarello are available rentals who could make sense.
Long term, this team will need a second-line center as well as a second-pairing defenseman. It doesn't seem likely either of those needs will be fulfilled at the deadline -- at least for a long-term commitment -- but it is possible.
Notes/restrictions:
Captain Jamie Benn has a full no-movement clause, as do Seguin, Alexander Radulov and Jason Spezza. Goalie Ben Bishop does as well, though Bishop's terms change in 2020-21 to a 10-team no-trade list.
Marc Methot has a 10-team no-trade list, while Martin Hanzal has a 15-team list.
The Stars are tight against the cap (with less than $4 million in projected cap space at the deadline, according to Cap Friendly), meaning they would need to clear space to orchestrate any significant moves.

Our take: It will be difficult to do something drastic, as in moving any core players. Acquiring a bargain scoring winger such as Zuccarello could give this team an extra push. If not, just let the chips fall where they may this season, and chalk it up to transitioning to a new coach.
What to watch: When the Wild hired Paul Fenton as general manager, everyone was curious as to how he would put his stamp on the roster. Minnesota has proved it is talented and deep enough to win in the regular season, though it hasn't showed the oomph to make a run in the postseason. So far, Fenton (who cut his teeth in the Predators organization) shocked us all by ... doing nothing. He has made only two deals in his tenure so far, both on the minor league level. Minnesota looks awfully similar to last year's team, except they've floundered of late and are on the fringes of the playoff picture.
Fenton has one of two choices: Shake up the current roster, or stay the course and re-evaluate over the summer. Fenton's choice will serve as an indicator for if he views this team's Stanley Cup window open with its current (but aging) core. If Fenton opts to sell, Charlie Coyle and Nino Niederreiter have been at the nexus of trade rumors since last season -- when Fenton's predecessor, Chuck Fletcher, was running the team -- and are the likeliest candidates to move out; Fenton made good on the Niederreiter possibility on Jan. 17, though the return wasn't perhaps as high as some might've hoped. If it somehow becomes a fire sale, Eric Staal -- who had an incredibly productive age-33 season but is mired in a slump -- could draw interest as an affordable top-six center. Staal is a unrestricted free agent this summer and has said he'd prefer to re-sign in Minnesota, but it's unclear if he'd fit in Fenton's plans if the GM is leaning toward a retool.
Notes/restrictions:
Staal and 29-year-old defenseman Jared Spurgeon are affordable veteran options for contending teams. Spurgeon, who carries a $5.2 million cap hit, is a longer-term rental, with a contract expiring after the 2019-20 season.
Both Staal and Spurgeon have 10 team no-trade lists; when Fenton was hired, he reportedly asked all the players to update their preferences.
If the Wild are looking to add, they'll have some room for flexibility. According to Cap Friendly, their deadline cap space is projected at about $8.6 million.
Minnesota has only one restricted free agent to take care of this summer; Joel Eriksson Ek's entry-level deal expires after this season.

Our take: This is a roster that feels stuck in neutral. With so many teams in the mix for contention this season, the Wild are a long shot in this spring's playoff field. That means Fenton would be wise to sell at the deadline. Moving Staal and Coyle should be fairly easy and could garner decent return.
What to watch: The Predators exited the playoffs earlier than most predicted last season, and GM David Poile wisely reacted by doing nothing at all. This is the essentially the same roster that we saw win the Presidents' Trophy in 2018-19. The Preds haven't been quite as dominant thus far this season, but they've weathered a plethora of injuries early, and as long as they're healthy, they're poised to make a run.
Poile has exercised patience thus far. But everyone knows he's a GM who likes to make a splash, and it's as if he saved his summer moves to find out exactly what his team needed midway through the season. He'll certainly be in conversations regarding the bigger names in February.
Secondary scoring punch could help, considering that was a vulnerability for Nashville during last spring's ill-fated run. The Predators could look at wingers such as Wayne Simmonds or Mats Zuccarello. The latter would cost far less than Simmonds, considering the Rangers forward has struggled quite a bit this season. Simmonds adds an element of grit, which is lacking a bit in the current forward group.
Notes/restrictions:
There is only one player on the roster with movement protection, and that's goaltender Pekka Rinne, who has a 10-team no-trade list.
Nashville made an unusual trade at last year's deadline in that it was within the division. The Predators acquired winger Ryan Hartman from the Blackhawks in exchange for prospect Victor Ejdsell, a first-round pick and a second-round pick.
The Predators were without picks in the first three rounds of the 2018 draft; however, they are well-positioned for the future: Nashville holds a pick in Rounds 1 through 7 in each of the next three years. Some of those picks might be used as trade capital.

Our take: Considering the Predators' sizzle-out last spring, we'd like to see Poile pull the trigger on one exciting move to help push this team over its playoff hump. A scoring winger makes sense, especially one who can add an element of toughness. Who fits that bill perfectly? Simmonds.

What to watch: GM Doug Armstrong has threatened to make seismic moves to the roster, and he hasn't followed up ... yet. But you get the sense he'd like to. The Blues have risen from the bottom-dwelling ashes to within four points of a playoff spot. If they keep up the ascent, Armstrong may not do anything too drastic. But it feels like this team will still be among the sellers.
In the sure-to-be-packing-his-bags department: Patrick Maroon had a terrific homecoming story when he took less money and term to play for the city he grew up in (and be with his son), but he hasn't produced and therefore is an ideal deadline mover. He's only on a one-year deal, worth $1.75 million, and his rugged style and experience thriving with skill players make him very attractive for contenders. (The Blues won't get much back because of his production this season.)
In the OK-that-feels-harsh-but-you-have-to-do-what-you-have-to-do category: Consider Brayden Schenn, the 27-year-old center. At a $5.25 million cap hit through 2019-20, teams might give up a decent bounty to get a guy who has averaged 61 points per season over the past three. Put right-handed defenseman Colton Parayko ($5.5 million through 2021-22) here, too.
In the holy-cow-did-he-really-do-that section: How about superstar forward Vladimir Tarasenko and captain Alex Pietrangelo? Both of those players would need to command multiple high draft picks as well as roster players in return, and these deals would qualify as blockbusters.
Notes/restrictions:
Several Blues players have no-trade lists worked into their contracts, including Tyler Bozak (10-team no-trade list), David Perron (five-team list), Maroon (eight-team list). Maroon's kicks in on Jan. 31.
There has been scuttlebutt about the potential of Pietrangelo being moved, but he carries a full no-trade clause that he would have to waive.
Jay Bouwmeester and Alexander Steen both have full no-trade clauses.

Our take: Considering the general disappointment that has been the 2018-19 St. Louis Blues season, Armstrong needs to change the complexion of this team for it to take a step forward. However, there's enough talent there not to give up on entirely. A few mid-level tweaks might be good enough to reset the culture. Disposing of too many big names could have adverse rippling effects. After all, many believed this to be a playoff team in the preseason.
What to watch: The window is wide open for the Jets, who soon will see themselves in salary-cap hell once they have to pay Patrik Laine and Kyle Connor the rich contracts that they deserve. After this season, the Jets also will have to manage keeping the blue line competitive, considering they likely can't afford keeping both Tyler Myers (impending UFA) and Jacob Trouba (RFA), or sign replacements of the same caliber.
What does that mean for this season's Jets? GM Kevin Cheveldayoff could look to move either Myers or Trouba to recoup value now, though it wouldn't be surprising to see both stay through the season, considering how important they are to Winnipeg's defensive corps. Cheveldayoff, who made a sizable move at last season's deadline to acquire second-line center Paul Stastny, could do something similar in February because he has the space to do so. Rangers forward Kevin Hayes has been linked to the Jets, for good reason. The soon-to-be UFA is a rugged forward who is versatile and could plug in anywhere into Winnipeg's lineup. His style of play (plus previous playoff experience) is perfect for a team looking to make a run in the Western Conference. Philadelphia's Wayne Simmonds would be a huge boon. The Jets also might look to add a defenseman.
Notes/restrictions:
Winnipeg has nearly $12 million in cap space now -- money they likely won't have next season after paying up for Connor and Laine.
Since taking the job as Winnipeg's GM in 2011, Cheveldayoff hasn't been known to be very active in the trade market. Last season's big move to acquire Stastny was considered off-brand for the usually modest Cheveldayoff, who rarely makes a splash when it comes to moving high draft picks or big-name players.
The Jets have four players over the age of 31 with some version of a no-movement clause (Bryan Little has a full no-movement clause. Blake Wheeler and Dustin Byfuglien have lists of 14 teams to which they cannot be traded, and Mathieu Perreault has a five-team list).
Defenseman Dmitry Kulikov, 28, also has a six-team list of teams to which he cannot be traded.
Winnipeg has eight players who become restricted free agents this summer.
Our take: Go for it, Jets. While this is a team patiently built via draft picks, adding one good piece (whether it be Hayes, Simmonds or a top-four defenseman like Los Angeles' Jake Muzzin) could be the difference between falling short in the Western Conference finals and going all the way.

What to watch: The standings, mostly. The Ducks already traded Andrew Cogliano, a well-liked veteran on the team since 2011, in the midst of a double-digit losing streak. If the season doesn't turn around to the point where GM Bob Murray is comfortable with Anaheim as a championship contender, how deep will the cuts go?
The fact is that the Ducks have a few players locked into no-move clauses, a quartet of defensemen the team would rather not move and some young forwards -- Rickard Rakell, Ondrej Kase, Nick Ritchie -- on bargain contracts who shouldn't be moved. From that defensive corps, 27-year-old Cam Fowler might generate the most interest at $6.5 million against the cap through 2026 on a new eight-year contract. But teams usually don't ink players to long-term deals only to flip them after one year, and Murray gave Fowler a modified no-trade clause as well.
One name worth noting: Jakob Silfverberg. The versatile winger is a stellar defender whose point production just hasn't reached the promise of his 49-point season two years ago. He's cheap ($3.75 million in average annual value), he's 28 and he's an unrestricted free agent at season's end. He's got value if Murray decides his next contract is too rich for the Ducks.
There's also backup goalie Ryan Miller, who was having a fine season before a lower-body injury in December landed him on injured reserve. But he has a modified no-trade clause as well.
Notes/restrictions:
Fowler's modified no-trade clause means he submits ""a four-team trade list"" to the Ducks, while Miller submits a six-team list, per Cap Friendly.
Anaheim is saddled with veteran players who have full no-move clauses: Ryan Getzlaf (33), Ryan Kesler (34) and Corey Perry (33), who has yet to play this season due to injury. Kesler hasn't been the same player since hip surgery in 2017 -- coach Randy Carlyle has called him ""adequate"" this season, but he has six goals since Feb. 9, 2018 -- but even if he didn't have a full no-move, one wonders how many takers there would be for the shell of Kesler at $6.875 million annually through 2022. Did Vancouver actually win that trade?
The Ducks do not have their third- and seventh-rounders in 2019, but otherwise own their draft picks through 2021.

Our take: If the asking price from Silfverberg and for Silfverberg are both on the high side, then Murray might want to ship him out before the deadline. Trading one of the defensemen is better left for the draft. But again, watch the standings: Despite an epic winless streak, the Ducks are still very much in the playoff race. If Murray won't cut Carlyle until after the season, he probably isn't cutting bait with this roster until then either.
What to watch: GM John Chayka has been active at the trade deadline before, but mostly as a seller: Please recall the Martin Hanzal, Michael Stone and Tobias Rieder deals, all of which worked out pretty well for the Coyotes.
There isn't that type of player on the Coyotes' roster as this deadline approaches, although pending UFA Richard Panik ($2.8 million) probably comes the closest. Does that mean Chayka will be more of a buyer, as Arizona continues to try to chase down a wild-card spot? Perhaps, especially with the Coyotes owning the third-meekest offense in the NHL at 2.53 goals per game.
But the biggest driver of what the Coyotes end up doing in the trade market is their own health. Along with forward Nick Schmaltz and goalie Antti Raanta, who are reportedly done for the season, the Coyotes are looking for lineup returns from forwards Michael Grabner, Brad Richardson and Christian Dvorak, and defenseman Jason Demers, who was thought to be lost for the season but could return from a knee injury. Those timetables are going to affect whatever Chayka does.
Notes/restrictions:
Among the players with trade protection are defenseman Alex Goligoski, signed through 2021 with a full no-move clause, somewhat inexplicably; defenseman Niklas Hjalmarsson, who has a no-trade clause that allows him to submit 10 teams on this current deal and has a full no-move clause that kicks in on July 1 for his next contract; Richardson, who has a full no-move clause; and Grabner, who submits an eight-team no-trade list.
The Coyotes have all of their picks for the next three years, except for their fifth- and seventh-round picks in 2019. They also own the Blackhawks' third-round pick this season.
Next season, Arizona still will have Marian Hossa's $5.275 million in dead cap space and the final $1,944,444 of Mike Ribeiro's contract buyout on their cap.

Our take: Again, it comes down to health. If the Coyotes are confident they're getting enough bodies back where overcoming a four-point standings deficit for the wild card is feasible, then trade a couple of picks for some offensive rental help. If not, then Panik ... and wait until next season.
What to watch: Sitting in first place in the Pacific Division after 47 games, the Flames are the biggest surprise in the Western Conference, but not a fleeting one: They're plus-40 (!) in goal differential, thanks to an offense that boasts four 20-goal scorers. That none of them would be named ""James Neal"" might be an even bigger surprise.
Neal is one piece that doesn't fit on this well-crafted team, with just four goals in 46 games and a minus-11 goal differential. He doesn't have any trade protection and at $5.75 million AAV (average annual value) through 2023 would seem primed for a ""you take our headache and we take your similar-salary-cap-hit one"" type of trade. But that might wait until the summer.
The targets for the Flames: depth on defense, in the form of a rental who could solidify their third pairing (someone like Trevor Daley comes to mind); another goaltender, just in case ""Big Game"" Dave Rittich is injured or turns into a pumpkin; and some additional help for the bottom six. Or, if they have a chance to swing for the fences, how perfect would Mark Stone fit in this group?
The assets for the Flames, besides Neal: forwards Michael Frolik, who is signed through 2020 and has 17 points in 30 games but hasn't always seen the commensurate ice time, as his agent has mentioned now and again; Derek Ryan, a serviceable center signed through 2021 with no trade protection at $3.125 million annually; and Austin Czarnik, who has another year at $1.25 million.
Notes/restrictions:
Beyond Frolik, the Flames have a few players with trade restrictions: center Mikael Backlund, who submits a 10-team trade list; defenseman Mark Giordano, with a full no-trade clause; defenseman T.J. Brodie, who has an eight-team no-trade list; and goalie Mike Smith, who has an eight-team no-trade list.
The Flames do not have second-, fourth-, sixth- or seventh-round picks in this year's draft. But they do have the Islanders' fourth-rounder and a seventh from Carolina. Calgary has all of its picks in 2020 and 2021.

Our take: Go for it! The Flames are an offensively explosive team with a defensive corps that compares well to any top four in the conference. Add that defenseman, add that goalie and then see if anyone is in need of a slightly used James Neal.
What to watch: Somehow, general manager Peter Chiarelli is still allowed access to a working telephone, so there's a lot to watch for when it comes to the Oilers.
TSN's Ryan Rishaug recently reported that the Oil have sent their scouts and staff marching orders to find help at forward with a ""first-round pick, a goaltender, maybe a young developing forward likely all in play."" So buckle up, kids, because Uncle Peter has a job to continue attempting to save by any means necessary.
The needs for the Oilers are many, beginning at the forward position. In theory, any goal-scoring winger they bring on can get the Connor McDavid Bump. Players such as Gustav Nyquist or Mats Zuccarello, both on expiring deals, could be intriguing to that end. They also need more puck-movers on the back end, but that's probably an issue for the summer. And frankly not one that you want Chiarelli to address, given what he's anted up for defensemen in the past.
To that end, watching the Oilers is more about what's leaving than what's arriving. For example: While forward Jesse Puljujarvi hasn't come close to fulfilling his hype as a No. 4 overall draft pick, he's still only 20 years old. It's entirely possible he could be in play.
Notes/restrictions:
Cam Talbot, who most certainly would be the goalie the Oilers trade, is a UFA this summer with a $4,166,667 cap hit. He has a modified no-trade clause that limits the Oilers' options to 10 destinations.
Other trade restrictions: forward Milan Lucic has a full no-move clause and is signed through 2023; defenseman Adam Larsson has a modified no-trade clause of eight teams, and is signed through 2021; defenseman Kris Russell (signed through 2021) has a full no-move clause, hilariously; and injured defenseman Andrej Sekera has a full no-move clause.
The Oilers have all their picks for the next two seasons except a fifth-rounder and a conditional third-rounder in 2019. The latter pick is either Edmonton's or the Islanders' headed to Florida, whichever one is the higher pick.

Our take: Pray for Connor.

What to watch: Everyone not named Drew Doughty, Anze Kopitar and Dustin Brown. And yes, that does include Jonathan Quick on the watch list, being that he makes $5.8 million annually through 2023 and has no trade protection.
GM Rob Blake has to dramatically reshape the roster of this Kings team, which has managed to prove both the ""they're too slow"" and the ""they're too old"" camps correct in their assessments. They have seven players over the age of 30 signed through 2021. They have to be open for business, and in a big way. They tried to squeeze out a little more from the vets who helped bring multiple Cups to L.A. Now it's time to find another bag of oranges.
The changes start on defense, where Jake Muzzin ($4 million AAV, signed through 2020) and Alec Martinez ($4 million, signed through 2021) are going to attract some attention. Up front, they'd love to ship out star forward Jeff Carter ($5,272,727 AAV, signed through 2022), but even without trade protection, history shows us that you don't want an unhappy Jeff Carter on your roster, so it would have to be a place he wants to end up. Carl Hagelin, 30, was seemingly acquired to be traded again at the deadline. He carries a $3.75 million hit and will be an unrestricted free agent this summer.
Notes/restrictions:
The Kings' full no-move clauses include Kopitar, Ilya Kovalchuk and Doughty.
The Kings have a few players with modified no-trade clauses: Brown, who submits a list of eight teams to which he can be traded; forward Nate Thompson, who has a 10-team no-trade list; and defenseman Dion Phaneuf, who submits a 12-team trade list.
Los Angeles has all of its draft picks for the next three seasons.

Our take: Obviously, many of the players we mentioned here are as good as gone. But the real trick for Rob Blake is going to be how short the bridge is going to be from the this retool to the next competitive era for the Kings, when players such as Rasmus Kupari and Mikey Anderson (and, health willing, Gabriel Vilardi) are making an impact.
What to watch: If there's a level beyond ""all-in,"" GM Doug Wilson is on that level. Consider: The Evander Kane trade and signing. The pursuit of John Tavares. The Erik Karlsson trade, and his potential re-signing.
The Sharks don't have much in the way of cap space to make something dramatic happen at the deadline -- just over $1.5 million, according to Cap Friendly -- and there isn't much salary they can ship out. But you know Wilson's going to try in this Western Conference arms race, perhaps for added center depth or more scoring on the wing.
Notes/restrictions:
Alas, the Sharks have mortgaged the future for the present. They don't own their first-round pick this season or next season. If the Sharks make the playoffs, they can choose to keep their 2019 first-rounder and give Buffalo its 2020 first-rounder, or hand over their 2019 pick for signing Kane. Ottawa gets this season's first if the Sharks miss the playoffs, as well as the pick that doesn't go to Buffalo in the above scenario. Their second-round pick is conditionally the Senators', too, as they get either the Sharks' or the Panthers' second, which San Jose owns. Their fourth-round pick in 2019 was dealt to Buffalo conditionally: The Sharks can keep it, but then have to give the Sabres their third in 2020. Oh, wait, there's more: No sixth-round or seventh-round picks in 2020. And their 2021 second-round pick goes to the Senators if Karlsson re-signs, and it becomes a 2021 first-rounder if the Sharks make the Stanley Cup Final in 2019. This is the kind of breakdown that usually requires a series of surveillance photos and string on an office wall to make sense.
There are only two Sharks with two full no-move clauses: Joe Thornton and Marc-Edouard Vlasic.
The Sharks have several modified no-trade clauses. Brent Burns, Evander Kane, Joe Pavelski and Logan Couture submit a three-team list to which they can be traded. Erik Karlsson has a 10-team no-trade list. Keep in mind that if Karlsson is actually traded at the deadline and ends up in the Eastern Conference, the Sharks have to give the Senators another first-rounder. Not as if he'd be traded, mind you, but just an FYI.

Our take: Rare is the deadline when Doug Wilson isn't active, and the Sharks are going for it. Limitations on cap space and assets might make it difficult, but we're guessing he stays aggressive and adds a veteran winger.
What to watch: With due respect to the Flames, the Canucks are the biggest shock contender in the Western Conference. Much of this is due to the arrival of Elias Pettersson, as we haven't seen a goal-scorer transform his team like this since Alex Ovechkin first strapped on the eagle for the Capitals. (And yes, I might even include ""more than McDavid"" here, because Pettersson has had so much influence on the organization as a whole.)
So the Canucks are battling for a playoff spot, which undoubtedly changes their expectations for the short-term future and for the trade deadline. That's specifically true on defense: If the Canucks were calculating their lottery odds instead of counting the number of points they are outside of the wild card, then Alex Edler ($5 million AAV, UFA, no-trade clause) might be closer to a trade than a new contract. Chris Tanev ($4.5 million, signed through 2020, modified no-trade) and Erik Gudbranson ($4 million, signed through 2021) also now seem likely to hang around.
Among the assets they could move: Michael Del Zotto, facing UFA status and without trade protection (a move they completed on Jan. 16, sending him to Anaheim); forward Nikolay Goldobin, who will be a restricted free agent this summer and is having a strong season and has his defenders, but the Canucks could cut bait after a recent benching; and center Brandon Sutter, who has a $4.375 million AAV and is signed through 2021 with a full no-trade clause until July 1, when it becomes a list of 15 teams.
Notes/restrictions:
The Canucks have all of their picks for the next three years, as well as those from the Senators and Capitals in the sixth round this season.
Among the no-trade clauses are winger Loui Eriksson, Sutter and Edler; Tanev has an eight-team no-trade list. Please recall that Antoine Roussel and Jay Beagle actually have modified no-trade clauses, with 15 teams to whom they can't be dealt.

Our take: The Canucks are clearly ahead of schedule, and it's only a good thing if they remain in the playoff hunt. (Ask Taylor Hall and Jordan Eberle about spending your formative years in the basement. Hint: Great for hockey bloggers, not so much for young NHL stars.) But it's not worth mortgaging the future for this season. No team with 47 points in 47 games should consider itself a buyer. Win the long game, not the deadline.
What to watch: With $3.38 million in cap space and a literal buffet of future assets, it's a virtual certainty that the Knights are going to be active at the trade deadline. Especially after getting a taste of championship contention last season.
There was heavy speculation that Blues center Brayden Schenn ($5.125 million AAV through 2020) could be a trade target due to his Brandon Wheat Kings ties with Vegas assistant GM Kelly McCrimmon. The Blues' return to the playoff race could affect that. Capitals winger Andre Burakovsky is available and GM George McPhee drafted him in 2013.
But rather than another body up front, one assumes the Knights are going to continue to bolster their back end. Not only because of their pursuit of Erik Karlsson during the last calendar year, but because they can read the rosters of the other Western Conference contenders and see their depth on defense. Vegas needs another point producer on the back end. Back to the Blues for a moment: Wouldn't Alex Pietrangelo be the perfect right-handed shot defenseman for the Knights, and wouldn't the Knights be an intriguing trade partner for the Blues if the latter had an eye on the future?
Notes/restrictions:
Center Paul Stastny has a 10-team no-trade list, while winger Reilly Smith and center Jonathan Marchessault have eight-team ones. Goalie Marc-Andre Fleury has a limited no-trade, submitting a list of 10 teams. He's also going nowhere.
The Knights have all of their own upcoming picks, save for a third-rounder in 2021 and a seventh-rounder this season. They also have 2019 third-rounders from the Predators and Jets, the Canadiens' 2019 fifth-rounder and second-round picks in 2020 from the Stars and Penguins.
Our take: Now that the Golden Knights are back to challenging for a division crown, it's time to put those future assets to use and grab the puck-moving defenseman they've been chasing for their first two seasons of existence.

25723980,"Bettman said the league has promised Seattle it will host All-Star weekend within its first seven seasons, with the team slated to begin play in 2021-22. Bettman also says Seattle will host the NHL draft, and that event will likely be awarded before the All-Star Game arrives.
We asked around at games and sports bars in Alabama and Tennessee to get answers from hockey fans living below the Mason-Dixon line.
Johnny Gaudreau, Amanda Kessel and Kaapo Kakko had big weeks, but the Blues goalie takes the prize.
""It doesn't mean we are going to wait seven years,"" Bettman said. ""We're going to be bringing league events here. This is where we want to be.""
Bettman's unexpected and informal announcement was part of his first visit to Seattle since the franchise was approved by the league's Board of Governors in early December. Bettman met with members of the ownership group, political leaders in the city, fans who have placed deposits on season tickets and reviewed the status of the massive renovation of the arena at Seattle Center where the team will play.
Seattle's ownership group has put up over $1.5 billion in expansion fees, upgrades to the building formerly known as KeyArena, and a state-of-the-art practice facility that is expected to open in time to host the first training camp.
""If you talk about in terms of kicking the tires, the tires are in great shape,"" Bettman said. ""We couldn't be more excited. When the board made the decision to come to Seattle, we knew it was the right decision, it would be a great decision and everything that has transpired has not only lived up to expectation but has exceeded our expectations.""
The franchise initially hoped to open for the 2020 season, but it is using the additional year to ensure the arena is operational well ahead of the team's home opener. It also gives the team more time to put together its hockey staff.
The team still doesn't have a name or color scheme. Bettman said the league would mostly stay out of the selection process, aside from working with the Seattle franchise in colors, trademarks and other logistical parts of the expansion name. Seattle team president and CEO Tod Leiweke said the goal is to have a name announced by the middle of 2019. The franchise will be taking major input from fans that have put deposits down on season tickets.
Leiweke said the team's goal is to have a portal launched within the next 60 days for season-ticket depositors to provide feedback and to inform them of the timeframe for decisions and announcements moving forward.
""If I have my way, their fingerprints are going to be all over this franchise. Certainly a team name, but they're going to help us build this,"" Leiweke said.
Some fans are hoping to see a return of the Seattle Metropolitans -- a historic name in Seattle, since the Metropolitans won the Stanley Cup in 1917. That name might be off the table, though, since the NHL has a division with that name.
Bettman was asked if that name can be ruled out.
""Viscerally, yes,"" he said, ""but I never say never to anything.""
"
25784759,"""They're running around corners, printing. That's what was happening,"" said Chris Foster, the NHL's director of digital business development.
The coaches wanted to innovate the process, and the league listened. The SAP-NHL Coaching Insights App will begin appearing on coaches' iPads located at the benches and in the dressing rooms -- which are currently used for video replays -- as early as February.
No more waiting for the printer to churn out stat sheets. The data will now arrive in the hands of coaches as the game is going on, in real time. No more waiting until intermission to analyze the numbers; now, coaches can make informed adjustments to everything, from faceoff choices to ice time, on the fly.
""This will provide real-time data, analytics and metrics to complement the video and give them what they want in the live game environment,"" Dave Lehanski, the NHL's senior VP of business development and innovation, told ESPN. ""As far as we know, we'll be the only sports property delivering real-time video and data to the benches for the coaches and the players.""
In 2017, the NHL and Apple partnered to build an in-arena, in-game coaching system that allowed teams to review video highlights during the game. The request was made by players and coaches, and the system was well-received.
Over time, coaches began asking about adding real-time stats to the iPads. So the NHL, Apple and SAP began collaborating with bench coaches, video coaches and team analytics analysts to determine what data they'd need during the game to better make decisions, and how best to deliver it. The result is a clean interface that brings the real-time stats found on the league's website during games, as well as exclusive features, into the hands of coaches during play.
ESPN got a glimpse of the app this week, which will be loaded onto new iPad Pro tablets for the teams. (These tablets, by the way, are restricted for use in the arena only, because of security concerns.) It allows teams to monitor any number of stats, from broad categories like shot attempts to narrower ones like faceoff success in certain areas of the ice and against certain opponents. Coaches can dial up which type of shot their players have used in a shootout the most, and what type of goals their netminders have surrendered.
Each data category is customizable, so coaches can specify which stats they're most interested in tracking. But there's also player customization: Coaches can set a particular ice time target for a skater, and then receive data on how close to that target a player is after each shift.
""There are two stat types across the board that every coaching staff said that, without question, helped them make in-game moment decisions: Time on ice and faceoffs,"" Foster said. ""With time on ice, you want to manage your top players to make sure they have gas in the tank at the end of the game, or if they're coming back from an injury.""
For both ice time and faceoffs, the app offers something that the coaches uniformly requested from the NHL: easy-to-read displays. Faceoff success or failure is depicted as a series of green circles with check marks or red circles with X's, and faceoff percentages can be broken down by where they were held and against whom.
""While coaches consider season performance or career performance, it's what they're doing in that game that matters,"" said Foster.
Players that are near or over their ice time projection during the game will have their names displayed in red, with a small red triangle with an exclamation point next to their photo -- similar to a ""check engine"" light on a car dashboard.
There's also the ability to map shots on goal for different situations, locations and specific players, with real-time data on the results of those shot attempts. But that information is the tip of the massive iceberg slowly moving the NHL into the future. Puck and player tracking technology is in its final testing stages, and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman expects that it will be used by teams and on broadcasts beginning next season.
While the SAP-NHL Coaching Insights App will help coaches for the rest of this season, Foster admits this is only Version 1.0 of what's to come with the data dump of player tracking tech. By next season, coaches could use it to track everything from the distances their players have skated to the velocity and placement of their shots each period.
""If the demand [for this] isn't there right now, it'll definitely be there when player and puck tracking arrives,"" he said.

25717035,"The team put Steen on injured reserve Tuesday before hosting the Dallas Stars. Steen injured his left shoulder on an open-ice hit from Flyers defenseman Radko Gudas in the first period Monday night in Philadelphia.
Steen has six goals and nine assists for 15 points in 32 games this season. The 34-year-old Swede is in his 10th full season with St. Louis and is a veteran of 930 regular-season NHL games with the Blues and Toronto Maple Leafs.

25736241,"""Due to unresolved issues/symptoms from the concussion sustained last March, Rick Nash will be forced to retire from the game of hockey. Under the advice of his medical team, the risk of further brain injury is far too great if Rick returns to play,"" his agent Joe Resnick said in a statement. ""Rick would like to thank everyone who has supported him during this difficult time period.""
Nash was drafted first overall in 2002 by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Playing for the Blue Jackets, New York Rangers and Boston Bruins, Nash had 437 goals and 368 assists in 1,060 career games. Until his retirement, Nash was third among active NHL players in goals scored, ranking behind Alex Ovechkin and Patrick Marleau. He led the NHL with 41 goals in 2003-04 and was a six-time All-Star.
He suffered several reported concussions during his NHL career, most recently in March as a member of the Bruins. He missed six weeks with concussion symptoms in 2013 while with the Rangers.
Nash was an unrestricted free agent after completing an eight-year, $62.4 million deal originally signed with Columbus. He was involved in two high-profile trades in his career: the six-player blockbuster in July 2012 that brought him from Columbus to New York and the February 2018 deadline trade that saw the Bruins rent him before free agency from the Rangers.
He was a franchise star with the Blue Jackets, but his tenure with the Rangers had its peaks and valleys, particularly due to inconsistency in the postseason, where Nash had 14 goals in 73 games. While with the Bruins, Nash had three goals and three assists in 11 regular-season games and three goals and two assists in 12 playoff games.
But after the season, Nash informed teams that he would not entertain offers as a free-agent forward, instead taking time to decide on his future.
""Rick has the utmost ethics and integrity,"" Resnick told ESPN. ""We turned down a lot of money. Let's put it that way.""
There had been speculation that Nash would sit out the summer free-agency frenzy and return to the NHL later in the season, perhaps when there was more clarity on which teams were contending for the Stanley Cup. Resnick denied that was the case last summer.
In the end, the decision was to choose long-term health over a return to the ice.

25737718,"The Predators' Austin Watson, whose suspension for domestic violence was reduced to 18 games by an arbitrator in October, is eligible to return Thursday vs. Arizona.
Watson said Friday in an Instagram post that he's been dealing with anxiety, depression and alcoholism since the age of 18. Watson said he entered the NHL's substance abuse program after his June 16 arrest and added that ""I am currently sober and committed to living a healthy lifestyle so that I can be the father, partner, teammate and person I want to be.""
Watson pleaded no contest July 24 to domestic assault and agreed to a judicial diversion program.
His girlfriend, Jenn Guardino, issued a statement in October taking blame for the incident and saying Watson would never hit or abuse her.

25746621,"The stick of Cam Atkinson slid through the goalie mask as Holtby raised it to prepare to deflect a potential shot, and the stick appeared to make contact with Holtby near his eyes.
Holtby was treated on the bench before heading to the locker room. The Capitals announced during the second intermission that he would not return to the game.
Coach Todd Reirden was ""very concerned'' and remained uncertain about Holtby's status afterward.
""He'll be getting evaluated later tonight still,'' Reirden said. ""Our initial discussions with our trainer and doctors, that's a serious thing. He wasn't able to return to the game, and we'll get some more evaluation tonight and know a little bit more tomorrow and have a better update for you guys then.''
Pheonix Copley replaced Holtby in net and stopped the first 10 shots he faced before allowing a power-play goal to Artemi Panarin 3:30 into overtime.
Atkinson, who scored earlier in the game, received a two-minute penalty for high sticking.
The Capitals had already gotten a scare when Alex Ovechkin left the game in the first period, but the NHL's leading goal-scorer came back for the second. Reirden said Ovechkin needed medical attention to close a cut on one of his hands.

25713702,"Kessel set a Riveters franchise record by recording five points in their 6-3 win over the Connecticut Whale on Sunday. All five points were assists, with four of them primary assists. Only two other players in NWHL history -- Kessel's U.S. national teammates Brianna Decker and Meghan Duggan -- have previously recorded five points in a game.
The diminutive dynamo had five goals and 11 points overall in four games last week, helping the Flames to a 3-1-0 record. That included two straight four-point games, becoming only the third player in franchise history to do that and the first since Doug Gilmour did it 30 years ago (!) in 1988. Gaudreau was the NHL's second star of the month in December and the first star for the first week in January. The best player in the NHL who may or may not be able to fit inside his own suitcase.
Kaliyev had 11 points in four games, including seven goals, for the Bulldogs. And he did it without the benefit of a hat trick: two goals, one goal, two goals and two goals. Kaliyev, 17, is a native of Staten Island, New York, which has produced such notable names as Nick Fotiu and Zach Aston-Reese.
A Reddit user posted this inspiring video that P.K. Subban created for the man's son, Ty Cornett, a youth hockey player in the Metro Detroit area:

""This year has been tough. My son is very aggressive and loud, so that brings out the trash talk. I have no problem with trash talking at all (part of the sport), but the racist talk needs to stop. Between the N-word being thrown at him over and over, being called monkey by players and parents, having an entire team beat their chests and act like gorillas whenever he touched the puck, and being told he should be lynched by former teammates,"" wrote the poster.
As you can hear, Subban sent a video of encouragement -- and Ty has watched it ""over 500 times."" Just another reminder that the hockey community will rally together to fight back against this kind of unconscionable ugliness.
It took everything I possess deep in my soul as an American hockey fan to put Kakko on this list. But alas, he earned it. He scored the game-winning goal with 1:26 remaining in regulation to lead the Finns to World Junior gold over the U.S., and in the process might have converted some non-believers into considering him for first overall pick in next June's NHL draft. Congrats to Kakko ... but another player was the best of the week.
And the best player in the world of the week is ...
Now, who is Jordan Binnington?
Last week, he was the goaltender for the AHL San Antonio Rampage. In fact, he earned that league's first star of the week honors for allowing one goal on 63 shots during two victories for the Rampage. That's a .984 save percentage, including a shutout at the Chicago Wolves, something no other AHL goalie has done in nearly two years.
But it gets better. Binnington was recalled by the Blues, the Rampage's parent club, on Saturday, and got his first NHL start on Monday in hostile territory: on the road, at the Philadelphia Flyers. It was just his fourth NHL appearance.
With his dad, John, and his stepmother, Pam, in attendance, the 25-year-old native of Richmond Hill, Ontario, made 25 saves for his first NHL victory and shutout.
""I think I was a little bit nervous, but at the same time calm and just tried to focus on my job and just stop the puck,"" he said. ""Go save by save, minute by minute and just enjoy the experience, and before I knew it, the game was over.""
Also over: this week. And Jordan Binnington was the best player from it. Congratulations!

25759354,"Greg Wyshynski, senior NHL writer: Back in October, I ranked the top 20 lines in the NHL, with the top units for Colorado and Boston taking the top spots. But it's the fourth-ranked unit on that list that I think could actually be the best in the league -- when it's healthy, that is. And that line consists of Filip Forsberg, Ryan Johansen and Viktor Arvidsson of the Nashville Predators.
Catch more than 180 NHL games streaming live this season on ESPN+. Click here for the upcoming schedule and to learn how to subscribe.
This line hasn't played much together this season due to injuries, but in 17 games, they've gotten 60.32 percent of the scoring chances at 5-on-5 and have outscored their opponents 15-11. Taken as a two-season sample, their line has a plus-22 in goal differential, a stellar 64.86 percent goals for percentage, gets 57.4 percent of the shot attempts at 5-on-5 and has an on-ice shooting percentage of 10.79 at even strength. Outside of goal differential, they're putting up numbers that are better or just as good as the Nathan MacKinnon line from 2017-19.
Forsberg is a dynamic offensive player. Arvidsson is a 30-plus goal scorer. Johansen is the glue, as a solid playmaker and a dependable two-way player. They're as much the engine for the Predators as any other top line is for their respective teams, and they're a ton of fun to watch in the regular season and the postseason, where they have a 68.75 goals-for percentage at 5-on-5 in 41 games together, with a plus-12 goal differential.
Emily Kaplan, national NHL reporter: We can debate the merits of All-Star roster construction later, but it's noteworthy that only one team is sending an entire line to San Jose. The Avalanche boast the best trio in hockey with Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen and Gabriel Landeskog.
Rantanen (68 points, trailing only Nikita Kucherov for the league lead) and MacKinnon (66 points) rank top five in league scoring; Landeskog is fifth in the league with 27 goals. This line has been sizzling since last season, but their domination has become pronounced because of consistency, totally independent of the team's performance. As a team, the Avalanche are floundering. Since Dec. 8, they have gone 3-10-3; no team has a worse record in that span. And yet Landeskog, Rantanen and MacKinnon are each averaging more than a point per game in that stretch (a combined 61 points in those 16 games). They're doing this all with a suspect supporting cast.
If Colorado makes the playoffs this season, it's because these three willed them there.
Dimitri Filipovic, hockey analytics writer: This is a tricky question because you can approach it from two different angles. On the one hand, you don't want to be a prisoner of the moment by being reactionary about a recent hot stretch. The king stays the king, and the most singularly dominant line in hockey in recent seasons has been the Bruins' combination of Patrice Bergeron, David Pastrnak and Brad Marchand.
The Lightning and Leafs maintain the top spots, with big movers elsewhere. Plus, which teams will finish above or below their current pace?
The players want to get rid of escrow, but their negotiations shouldn't include sacrificing long-term deals and the job security that comes with them.
The drawback to a muscular posterior? It's tough to find a pair of jeans that will fit. Connor McDavid and other NHL stars chronicle the struggle.
When they're on top of their game, what makes them special above all else is the way they seemingly suck the life out of opponents, playing a game of keep away like a big brother tormenting his younger siblings. If you had to pick one line for a playoff series, they'd probably be the right pick, because they've been that good for that long. The issue is that at this moment, it's unfair to the others to say that they've been the best when the results aren't there this season. Because of injuries, they've played south of 300 5-on-5 minutes together, and because of surprisingly subpar goaltending, they've only outscored opponents by a miniscule 17-15 margin in those minutes.
But if we're going to look at recent performance and reward accordingly, let's give some love to the Calgary Flames' top line. With the trio of Johnny Gaudreau, Sean Monahan and Elias Lindholm on the ice, the Flames have been stupendously good. In 525:39 of 5-on-5 time, they've outscored opponents by a whopping 38-22 margin. Beyond that, they've asserted their dominance by putting the clamps down on whoever happens to be out there against them; they've controlled 56.4 percent of the shot attempts, 54.6 percent of the shots on goal, and 55.3 percent of the scoring chances.
Most importantly, they're the driving force behind a Flames team that currently sits atop not only the Pacific Division, but the entire Western Conference. At this point, what else could they do to turn any remaining skeptics into believers? They've already been doing it all.
Victoria Matiash, fantasy analyst: Now that Zach Hyman is healthy, I'll take the Maple Leafs' top line over all others in the here and now. Along with talent and skill, there's no overstating the value in great chemistry. The combination of Mitch Marner's exceptional playmaking, Hyman's ability to create time and space, and all that John Tavares does well -- which is essentially everything -- blends brilliantly.
In only 34 games together, this trio has meshed for a 64.29 percent goals for percentage at 5-on-5. They're already a combined plus-50. Often matched up against the opposition's toughest competition, Tavares will likely finish with 50 goals for the first time in his career (he's never reached 40). Marner is on pace to bust through 100 points at only 21 years old. Without putting up anywhere near such numbers himself, Hyman helps make it all happen. They're stealing ice time away from Auston Matthews' line, for crying out loud. That's no accident.
Postgame analysis and highlight show airing each night throughout the season from Barry Melrose and Linda Cohn. Watch on ESPN+
As a fun aside, this trio also presents as one of the league's top bargains, adding up to just a bit more than $14 million in annual salary (with $11 million paid out to Tavares alone). That all changes when Marner cashes in large as a restricted free agent this offseason; but for now, there's no greater bang for buck. In fact, what they're offering the Leafs right now -- a legit chance at beating Boston and maybe Tampa Bay in the postseason -- is priceless.
Ben Arledge, associate NHL editor: You can't go wrong with the top Colorado or Toronto or Tampa Bay units, but the Winnipeg Jets' trio of Mark Scheifele, Blake Wheeler and Kyle Connor is the best line in the NHL in my opinion. Wheeler and Scheifele both rank in the top 10 in points, and Connor has 16 goals.
Perhaps the wildest thing about this is that Winnipeg's best player, Patrik Laine, doesn't even skate with them, yet they still have an absurd 65.3 Corsi for percentage together, according to Natural Stat Trick. Wheeler and Scheifele continue to be some of the most underappreciated stars in the NHL, and Connor's 31-goal rookie campaign was overshadowed by ridiculous seasons by Mathew Barzal and Brock Boeser. This line is just stacked with talent. And for my money, it is the best in the league.

25707545,"All of that training, however, came with a sacrifice: He didn't work his butt off at all. Actually, his lower half became too big to fit into most pants.
""Can it be hard for me to find pants? Yes, always,"" McDavid says. ""The waist, you need to get around your thighs and butt, but that doesn't always match how tall you are. I definitely have a hard time finding jeans that fit.""
He's hardly alone. ""I have had trouble,"" Dallas Stars captain Jamie Benn says. ""I just need to find the right company. Jeans are the hardest.""

Penguins forward Zach Aston-Reese forgot to bring jeans on a road trip earlier this season. So while the team was in Ottawa, Aston-Reese ventured to the Levi's store. That's when he received a call from teammate Derek Grant. ""Are you still shopping?"" Grant asked. ""Can you buy me a pair?""
""Sure,"" Aston-Reese said. ""What size?""
""34,"" Grant said.
""No way!"" Aston-Reese replied.
Aston-Reese is technically a 34 waist himself, but he always buys a size 36 ""because my butt won't fit in a 34,"" he says. ""Derek is bigger than me,"" Aston-Reese adds. ""So there we are, having an argument in the Levi's store, because I was sure I was right.""
Several NHL players express their struggles with finding a pair of jeans that fits properly.
Not everyone fits into the same exact mold, making the sweet spot for size unique for every player.
""I've never really talked about it,"" Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews says. ""But it's definitely a thing a lot of guys go through.""
""It's an absolute nightmare between the quads and the glutes,"" Montreal Canadiens center Max Domi says. ""The glutes especially, because it just throws off your waist. You have, like, a 48 waist with your ass, but without it, you're a 32. So what do you do? Meet halfway, and you still have all this extra stuff.""
New York Islanders winger Anders Lee often goes to the mall with his wife. ""I'll try on, like, 40 pairs of pants or jeans,"" he laments, ""and we'll walk away with one ... or none. Oh, and anything that says 'skinny'? Trust me, I'm not getting into that.""
Postgame analysis and highlight show airing each night throughout the season from Barry Melrose and Linda Cohn. Watch on ESPN+
Last month, Blackhawks defenseman Connor Murphy spent an off day at Bloomingdale's. He tried on about 10 pairs of jeans and none of them fit. ""I got so mad, I hate shopping,"" Murphy says. ""But the saleswoman was really helpful and spent a lot of time with me, so I literally bought a pair because I felt bad for her -- even though they didn't fit and I knew I was going to return them later. I just had guilt.""
""There's definitely some pants I can't really fit into,"" says reigning league MVP Taylor Hall of the Devils. ""Some shorts that maybe fit my waist but don't fit the other parts. It's a challenge. You want to have big legs in hockey. You want to be a guy who skates well and uses his power, for sure. But that means ...""
We'll finish Hall's thought: If your body makes you good at your job, it provides bad luck in the dressing room (of a department store, that is).
This might be a new phenomenon, coinciding with the evolution of hockey players' training and, therefore, their physiques. Domenico Vacca is the personal tailor to upward of 250 NHL players and some coaches. Since the 1980s, he has been flying around North America creating custom suits cut from his own fabric for some of the game's biggest stars.
""It's a lot different now than it used to be,"" Vacca says. ""When I started, it was all about the upper body. The upper body was very big. Now, maybe six or seven years ago, I noticed the guys are all bigger in the thighs.""
This make's Vacca's job especially important because the trend now is a tapered look. In the '90s, players would have a baggy 27 inches around the knee. Now it's more like 17 or 18.
Finding the right tailor is one way to go. Before Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Jack Johnson discovered his brand of choice, Banana Republic, he says he would buy pants with ""a waist so big that they'd get over my thighs, then get them tailored to the point where my back pockets were, like, touching. It looked ridiculous.""
Football is king in the Cotton State, but from Huntsville to Birmingham and, yes, Tuscaloosa, there are many puckheads to be found.
The star winger has his Flames in first place, and he's on pace to shatter his previous career highs. We check in with the New Jersey native.
Only two goalies have won the Hart Trophy as MVP this millennium. Here's why the Ducks goalie should be No. 3, plus updates on all the other award races.
As for the larger-thigh phenomenon, it becomes more pronounced once a player gets to the NHL. For example, Vacca outfitted one player for the NHL draft in 2014. He recently visited that player to get him fitted for a new suit. ""His upper body is the same, almost exactly the same measurements at the top,"" Vacca says. ""His thighs were up an inch, and his hips were up two-and-a-half inches.""
Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone. If you've ever stood next to Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, you'll notice he's quite tall (6-foot-2) but slight. ""I am fine buying pants,"" he says. ""No problem.""
Goalies have different needs. As for the men skating in front of him?
""I used to have to get the husky pants when I was a kid,"" Boston Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy admits. ""Actually, once I became a Bruin, when I became a pro hockey player and had some walk-around money, then I discovered the jeans that were really soft, and they really fit to you. I got a couple pairs of those. But I just didn't wear jeans in college. I was a big sweatpants guy in college. Just Champion sweatpants. I roomed with Jordan Greenway -- he's a big boy -- and we would just wear sweatpants every day. We were the sweatpants and sweatshirts room.""
Once players start to have more disposable income, they find some brands that work. McDavid and Benn swear by Paige denim, which is known to use stretchier material, though an average pair retails for $199. McDavid also discovered an Ottawa-based brand, Heritage 34, this summer. Florida Panthers center Vincent Trocheck is a Diesel guy. Norwegian-born Blackhawks winger Andreas Martinsen found a Swedish brand he liked. So he bought pairs in black, and blue, and another shade of blue ....
But not everything has to be too pricey, as long as one is willing to experiment. Once Philadelphia Flyers captain Claude Giroux discovered the chain Zara, he found a sense of relief. ""I have smaller calves, too, for some reason,"" Giroux says. ""Zara, their suits fit me perfectly for some reason, so I'm there often. That's the one place I can shop.""
Those who aren't lucky enough to find a brand that works must resort to the more expensive option. ""Over the last three years, I realized I could get it custom,"" veteran Minnesota Wild center Eric Staal says. ""If you include the suits, I've spent a couple thousand, for sure."" Anaheim Ducks defenseman Josh Manson usually buys size 36 pants at the store, which is too big for his waist, but he gets everything else tailored.
""Every pair of pants I have is custom,"" Domi says. ""Whether it's jeans, joggers ... actually, I can get away with sweatpants, but that's it.""
A few smart businesses have cornered the niche market.
Leo Tropeano is a former soccer player who noticed that most jeans are built on the bell curve for the ""average guy."" He consulted with 2010 Hobey Baker winner Blake Geoffrion and realized hockey players were even more disproportionate. Two years ago, Tropeano launched the Chicago-based Mugsy Jeans. Although the ""custom denim that allows for flexibility"" isn't directly catered to hockey players, Tropeano has noticed that's who has latched on most. He says about five out of every 10 people who come into the Chicago storefront end up being ""hockey guys."" It's no coincidence that Mugsy advertises on the popular ""Spittin Chiclets"" podcast.

The Canadian brand GongShow is even more overt. ""The hockey world is really small. Everyone knows everyone,"" says founder and CEO Ger McNamee, a former junior hockey player. ""Guys would come home in the summer, and if you noticed someone had a good-fitting pair of jeans, we'd all ask where they got it. If a guy found a pair, he'd order 10 to 12 pairs.""
GongShow was founded in 2002 and proudly boasts the world's first pair of ""hockey jeans."" The pants are a little looser in the thighs, have more area in the butt, and mix in a little spandex to be more forgiving. ""They're built for the hockey ass,"" McNamee says. The biggest pair of jeans GongShow offers is called the Quadrasaurus. The company has partnered with the CWHL, and in talking to women's players, it realized that finding properly fitting jeans isn't a gender-specific issue. The company launched a women's line last year.
Hockey players aren't alone. McNamee found that a slew of athletes from other sports -- downhill skiers, speed skaters and some weightlifters -- have the same problem finding pants.
Which brings us back to McDavid. As exceptional as he is at so many aspects of hockey -- on an unattainable level for most -- his struggle to find pants actually gives him comfort. It's one area where he's relatively normal.
""At least I know I'm not alone,"" he says.

25738215,"Weal has three goals and nine points in 28 games for the Flyers this season. Over parts of four seasons, Weal had 19 goals and 42 points in 124 games. Weal was originally drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the third round of the 2010 draft.
The trade announced Friday could be the first of many changes for the Flyers as the trudge into the weekend in last place in the Eastern Conference .
The Flyers pick up career minor-league defenseman Jacob Graves, who has seven points playing for the ECHL's Norfolk Admirals. The Flyers also get a sixth-round pick in the 2019 draft.

25759800,"Cogliano, 31, has three goals and eight assists in 46 games this season, as his ice time (13:15) was cut by nearly two minutes per game. Considered one of the fastest skaters in the NHL, Cogliano has also been the league's most durable players. His ""iron man"" streak of 830 games was only snapped by a two-game suspension last season; otherwise, he hasn't missed a game to injury in his NHL career.
The NHL trade season is underway. Get caught up on the assets, restrictions and potential moves for every team ahead of the Feb. 25 deadline.
Cogliano has 379 points in 912 career games with the Ducks and the Edmonton Oilers. He's signed through 2021 with a $3.25 million cap hit.
""In acquiring Andrew, we are able to add a conscientious player who brings a veteran presence to our room,"" said Dallas general manager Jim Nill. ""His explosive speed, 200-foot game and iron-man mentality will help our team both on and off the ice.""
Shore, 24, is in his fourth NHL season, all spent with Dallas. He has five goals and 12 assists in 42 games this season, but like Cogliano has seen his ice time (13:18) tumble from last season's 15:26 per game. He has 82 points in 209 career games, and can play center or wing. Shore is signed through 2020 after which he'll become a restricted free agent, with a cap hit of $2.3 million.
Both the Ducks (19-18-9) and the Stars (23-19-4) have been on a roller coaster this season. Anaheim is winless in its last 11 games, with general manager Bob Murray issuing a statement backing coach Randy Carlyle after Sunday night's overtime loss at Winnipeg. ""At this time, I am not considering a coaching change. I am more focused on our players, specifically with who is going to step up in this situation,"" he said.
Trading away a well-liked veteran like Cogliano, who has been with the Ducks since 2011, certainly sends a message to that locker room.
Dallas (23-19-4) has lost two games in a row and is 5-4-1 in its last 10 games, sitting in third place in the Central Division. The team has been rocked by harsh words from management recently, as team president Jim Lites ripped star forwards Tyler Seguin and Jamie Benn for their down seasons and coach Jim Montgomery called out the team's losing culture after a 3-1 loss to the St. Louis Blues on Saturday.
""I'm very frustrated that I have not been able to gain consistency in our performance, and I haven't been able to change the culture of mediocrity,"" he said.

25715383,"The Predators have positioned themselves as the team of the South and have provided a template for other Southern teams to follow by unabashedly embracing their community's roots while selling the experience of Nashville even more than the hockey itself. They drew under 15,000 per game in 2009; entering 2019, they're drawing over 17,200 on average.
As part of our examination of hockey in Alabama, we asked a few dozen Predators fans who live in that state about how their favorite NHL team has reached out to that market, and what they believe are the ways in which the NHL could finally figure out how to attract fans in the South to watch its product and purchase its merchandise.
How should the NHL market hockey to the South? A handful of suggestions:
Matthew McWhorter, Daphne, Alabama
""I would think the best start to growing in the South would be to simply increase visibility. I've never seen anything associated with the NHL in Alabama. I don't see apparel in stores, coverage on TV [unless I specifically seek it out], or any kind of advertisement. The only hockey fans I know, other than myself, are the two Canadians where I work.""
Alex Graben, Muscle Shoals, Alabama
Football is king in the Cotton State, but from Huntsville to Birmingham and, yes, Tuscaloosa, there are many puckheads to be found.
The star winger has his Flames in first place, and he's on pace to shatter his previous career highs. We check in with the New Jersey native.
Johnny Gaudreau, Amanda Kessel and Kaapo Kakko had big weeks, but the Blues goalie takes the prize.
""The biggest disconnect is that it is not widely available to many folks in the South. Sure, you may get a prime-time game on NBC, but your casual viewer in the South will more than likely skip over it to view something else, especially if football is on. I think the last two seasons saw a rise in Southern viewership because the Preds had such outstanding seasons, and everyone loves a winner.
""I honestly think if the NHL were able to start some youth programs in some of these areas it would garner attention quickly. We love contact sports, we love to be rowdy, and we love a good athletic event. Many around here just don't understand that hockey isn't 'soccer on ice.'
""People in the South love it when other people embrace their culture. Nashville did an outstanding job of that in their playoff runs by rolling out the red carpet for country music acts and having a 'tailgate atmosphere' on Broadway [in Nashville]. I think the NHL or Preds organization can use that to sell their product to many potential fans in the South. I know many, many nights I'd rather be on Broadway than in Tuscaloosa. That atmosphere is second to none.""
Kaylor Hodges, Jasper, Alabama
""In my hometown of Jasper, there's nothing to do with hockey. Finding another person who is an avid fan like I am is rare. While the return of the Birmingham Bulls has rekindled the fire for hockey, it's still a thing people do once and just aren't sold on yet.
""As for outreach, [there hasn't been much]. I feel like Alabama is a place that if you love hockey, it's because you heard of the Thrashers and the Bulls, and when both teams disappeared, so did the love for the sport. There isn't much outreach because I feel like we're really not a group that is viewed as 'needed,' at least that's the way I see it.
""I believe the NHL should try and cultivate a fandom here in the South. I think the best way is to bring a high-quality product for a preseason game of some kind just so a top-tier team is in a place nearby and fairly affordable. I still have never seen Nashville in person because the prices of tickets are high, and that's a weekend trip. If the NHL were to do what NBA did and have one match in Birmingham with two known teams for preseason, I feel like it would bring a lot of interest to not just NHL but SPHL.
""Right now the Bulls sell pretty well in the winter/spring, but the fall attendance is very poor, and that's a reflection of awareness and product that the organization puts on the ice. While the Bulls are undefeated, the atmosphere they create and the show they put on when hockey isn't being played is very lackluster.""

""I always contend that if you go to a game in person, you've got a very good chance of getting hooked and wanting to learn more and dig deeper. The Preds have done a great job of combining entertainment on the ice with elsewhere in the arena. Even if you're a novice hockey fan, they put on a game-day experience that is enjoyable to all.
""It's hard to cast a huge shadow via kids camps and all the proactive community outreach that the Preds do in Middle Tennessee, but an event or two outside the Nashville MSA would be well-received and attended, I believe.""
Thomas Boydstun, Birmingham, Alabama
""So far I think the increase in the Preds' TV exposure has been a real help. However, thanks to Nick Saban, Alabama football is always going to be king of the castle in the state of Alabama. With the growing popularity of both the Birmingham Bulls and the Huntsville Havoc, I think there is an opportunity for both the Preds and the NHL as a whole to do some more advertising. I know licensing deals make things hard, and the SPHL doesn't have any affiliation that I know of, but I don't think it would be that hard to send some representatives down for a couple of games to do some giveaways or something like that. Also, maybe pick a few games on the schedule where a discount on tickets is given to people from states like Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia [RIP Thrashers].
""Also, I think the growth of youth hockey is so important. I primarily grew up in Tennessee and Mississippi and never had the opportunity to even try hockey. The only sports that were available to play were baseball, basketball, football and a little bit of soccer. I would have loved a chance to get started playing at a younger age. Hockey is such a great community and sport that once a kid is hooked they are probably going to be a fan for life. I know the Preds have increased the support of youth leagues within the Nashville area, but if they could put on some camps down in Huntsville and Birmingham I think it would go a really long way.""
Nick Corcoran, Gulf Shores, Alabama
""There is really no 'hockey culture' in town. As for kinship, it's mostly my family. I do have a lot of co-workers from Illinois who are big St. Louis Blues fans, so they're the only other ones really to talk hockey with. Only youth leagues or beer leagues are in Pensacola, which is about an hour away. We are a big tourist town, but hockey season and beach season don't line up, so we don't have much of a need for a hockey bar.
""I would say some sort of exhibition games would be a start. College football is obviously king in the South, so finding a way to tie that in would be the best way to reach the most people. Something similar to the guest appearances from the Titans during the playoffs would be a good move. Honestly though, it's gonna be a long road. Saying you are a hockey fan gets you some weird looks in Alabama, I think hockey fans will have to migrate here and bring the fandom with them. So it may already be more prevalent in the bigger cities.""
Jessica Edwards, Huntsville, Alabama
""Though the Preds don't do much promotion down here, it's not unusual to see Preds stickers on cars, or the occasional gold hat in a restaurant if there's a TV and a sympathetic bartender. Havoc stickers are everywhere. People who look at me funny for not following football at all relax when I tell them I enjoy hockey. Huntsville is a hockey town. Maybe we're not the hockey capital of the South anymore, but we're still a hockey town.

""Growing the game is a tough one. Alabama doesn't take quickly to 'folk from off' telling us we should do things, even good, interesting things. It's my guess that other Southern states are similarly insular. So if the NHL wanted to promote hockey down here, their best bet might be in quietly, steadily sponsoring local initiatives already in place -- gear for youth leagues, or a contribution to maintaining existing ice plexes. Maybe holding games in various arenas around the South, the way that Bruins/Flames game was held in China? Grassroots stuff, watering what already grows, offering a seed and letting the locals decide whether they plant it. I have no idea what the mechanisms are for deciding what gets broadcast where, but my household is a perfect example of the power of channel surfing among over-the-air and limited-cable audiences. Folk without satellite TV or a big cable package might watch more hockey if there was more hockey on the major networks to watch.""
Daniel Mead, Huntsville, Alabama
""Hockey culture in Huntsville existed well before the Predators were even a thought in Nashville. In fact, former Governor George Wallace declared Huntsville 'The hockey capital of the South.' This is mostly due to UAH's NCAA hockey team and a couple of professional teams that have come through Huntsville, the Havoc being the longest-lasting and most recent. The Havoc consistently play in front of a mostly full arena. As of right now, the only pro sport in Huntsville and northern Alabama is the Havoc, although a minor league baseball team is on the way. As far as I can tell, there are only four permanent ice surfaces available to the public in the entire state of Alabama. I would assume Mississippi doesn't have many more if they even have that many. I don't know how you really grow a sport and fan base in an area where the average kid will likely never even put on a pair of skates.
""The other proven way to make a hockey fan is to have them go to their first game. I don't know of anyone who has ever gone to a hockey game and not become a fan. Bring more one-off games to non-NHL cities and stadiums.
""The NHL loves outdoor games that they can sell specialty jerseys and lots of tickets to. Bring Stadium Series games to the Deep South. These SEC stadiums are huge and are empty three-quarters of the year. An NHL game in Bryant-Denny stadium where Nick Saban does a puck drop would help the NHL get the entire state of Alabama.
""New Orleans will never have an NHL team, but why not have a game in the Superdome? Or have the Flames and Jets play in Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The loser moves back to Atlanta.""
Daniel Thompson, Huntsville, Alabama
""I personally think the NHL as a whole has done a fairly good job at broadening the sport into 'nontraditional markets.' And at least here locally, I think that Nashville has done a stellar job and growing the sport too with their programs and not limiting it to just Nashville metro. These programs create players who in turn will probably be fans of the best league in the sport.
""The Preds' Cup run created a hockey frenzy, even here in Huntsville. And despite how much people like to complain about the 'bandwagon' fans [which doesn't just apply to Nashville], everyone has to start somewhere. People who had never tuned in to a game were now watching. Many are still watching. Like me, it just took that one game. It also had a direct effect on the numbers in the local youth and beer leagues. Season prior to the Cup run, the mini-mites had about 40 kids. The following season their numbers were closer to 70. Last adult season, SOL had the same four, six, and eight teams, and HAHL only had one division of four teams. Between the two leagues, we are icing 10 more teams than last year. All the people that started in the adult development after the Cup run have made it into the beer leagues.""
Hank Walters, Enterprise, Alabama
""Hockey will only grow down here with more kids on the ice. And we need more ice. Closest one I know of is a baby-sized rink in Montgomery that's an hour-and-a-half away. Or even roller hockey would be cool. Education of the sport would help too, but folks won't want to learn about it unless they can try it. The NHL would have to at least invest in converting football fans to casual viewers, which is the best they'll get without a surge of youth leagues. I've struggled with the same problem playing rugby. No one grew up with these sports down here, so they ultimately say the same thing: 'Oh ya? That's cool as hell, everyone hitting each other and stuff. I just have no idea what's going on.'""
Andrea Walls, Muscle Shoals, Alabama
""In Muscle Shoals specifically there really is not a hockey culture to speak of. We will see the occasional Preds sticker on a car or person wearing a Preds shirt, and you feel the need to go up to the person and say 'You love the Preds? We love them too!'
""We play hockey in Decatur and Huntsville, and hockey definitely has more of a presence in those towns. Most people we encounter in Muscle Shoals are surprised when I tell them our boys play hockey. A frequent comment is, 'I didn't even know you could do that here,' or, 'Where do you go to do hockey?'

""We are very happy with the youth league here in North Alabama [we play with the North Alabama Hockey Association]. It is a very well-organized league and has good participation for a Southern hockey market. They frequently offer skills clinics, summer hockey camps and power skating classes to help the kids develop their skills. My husband plays in the beer league [also through NAHA]. Being part of the league does give us the chance to interact with other hockey fans in the area. A lot of them are big fans of the Huntsville Havoc and frequently attend their games. There aren't too many people around here who follow the Preds as closely as we do, and so we do tend to rely on sites like Reddit to fill the gaps for us.
""I would love to see them get the word out more about the Learn to Play or Try Hockey for Free programs. We really only found out about them because we were hockey fans and occasionally went to the rink to skate. They are more advertised in Decatur and Huntsville, it would be great to see that advertisement reach further out into the other communities. We have had one friend give it a try and is now doing Learn to Play, so I feel like if others knew about it and gave it a try they might like it as well. Soccer culture in the U.S. has grown so much over the past couple decades, and I think a lot of that is due to more kids playing it, leading to more parents [and kids as they grow] following the sport. The same could hold true for hockey in the south. Also, encouraging groups from Alabama [like sports teams or clubs] to come to a game via discounted tickets would also get people in the door that likely have never even seen a hockey game.
""The atmosphere at Bridgestone Arena is just electric and really pulls people in. I know after seeing one game I was a fan for life. I am sure there are others out there who would feel the same way if they were able to experience it.""
Ron Bryant, Somerville, Alabama
""As far as kinship is concerned, if you are wearing a Preds shirt/hat/sweater in public and you hear a 'Go Preds!' you will find each other and have an instant friend. But I am only two hours away from the Predators and there are zero promotions to try to recruit new fans. Alabama is seen as the football state and almost gets a pass from the NHL. There needs to be a culture push as far as promotions, appearances, and outreach from teams and the NHL as a whole -- the Panthers, Lightning, Stars and Predators.
""About 12.9 percent of all NHL teams are in what is considered the Southern U.S., but we continue to only be bombarded with college football and baseball. I am wrapped up in the Dunkin' Donuts promotions for the Atlanta Braves, which is 3.5 hours away, but not for the Predators, which is under two hours away. Also, ticket prices. I am happy that people are willing to pay large amounts of money to go to see their teams, but if you want to grow a fan base, tickets need to be affordable to the people who have their heart and passion invested in the teams.""
Steven Darby, Huntsville, Alabama
""Even though Gary Bettman is widely hated throughout the league, I think he's done a great job in terms of Southern expansion. Nashville and Tampa are two of the top markets in the whole league right now. It definitely helps that they're two of the top teams in the standings, but I've heard the atmospheres are also tops in the league.
""I'd really like to see college hockey expand in the South. I think the success Arizona State is having right now shows that it can definitely work. I think the players love the warm weather down here, and if the schools had the resources they could recruit some of the bigger-named players. Nashville itself has really done a great job of creating a college-like atmosphere at their games and mixing it with hockey. I'm a student at Auburn right now, and I think if some big SEC schools could fund a higher level than club hockey, it would be great for the sport. I also think that college hockey is gaining a lot of interest in NHL prospects compared to other junior leagues. I think if they could get some big SEC schools on the D-I level, that could give college hockey a greater boost.""
Matthew Mireles, Tuscaloosa, Alabama (by way of Atlanta)
""Honestly? Put a team back in Atlanta. I know that seems like such an absurd idea that it's not even worth the energy to laugh off, but the Atlanta Spirit group was only ever apathetic towards hockey at best, and malicious at worst. The Thrashers leaving was due to poor ownership. The low attendance in the final years was merely a symptom.
""I played in my hometown city. It's full of transplants like my parents who will go see their hometown teams and their kids grew up loving their hometown team. There were two or three active amateur leagues that were constantly growing in my time playing there, and all lamented the loss of the team. Yes, our attendance was poor at the end, but in the Thrashers' best seasons in 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, tickets were difficult to come by, and Philips Arena [now State Farm Arena] was full. Atlanta is larger than Nashville, Raleigh and Tampa, and there is already a seed of fans needing a team. Bring one back. You can start by having the Predators and Canes play some preseason games in Atlanta.
""Second, I know that UGA, Georgia Tech and Kennesaw State University all have hockey teams that are fairly prominent and successful in their own right, as well as Alabama having the Frozen Tide. What the league needs to do is go to the sports fans and show them hockey. If the Southerners can tie hockey to their favorite school, it will gain traction fast.
""I'm a scientist, not a marketing or PR mind, so speculation as to what specific outreach events the league should run with the universities around the state is best left up to others. Maybe if they're interested in a long-term investment, make some kind of initiative to get rinks built on SEC/ACC campuses that have competitive/visible programs [by the region's standards, we'll never compete with the collegiate hockey powerhouses].
""The Predators aren't a hockey team in Nashville; the Predators are Nashville's hockey team. That's how the NHL needs to approach the South, and the regional universities are one of the ways that I can see to do that. Also, I regularly converted friends at undergrad who had grown up in college-football-as-the-gospel households, that became intense hockey fans once exposed to the sport. Hockey will never replace college football as the 'sacred sport' of the South, but there is no reason it can't be up there with it.""
Sean Smyth, Huntsville, Alabama
""That's a tough question. Personally, I'd love for Huntsville to get an NHL franchise named the Aliens, it would go with the city's space and NASA industries, and create the best rivalry of all time in Aliens vs Predators. I'd bet that'll never happen for a multitude of reasons, but a man can dream.""
