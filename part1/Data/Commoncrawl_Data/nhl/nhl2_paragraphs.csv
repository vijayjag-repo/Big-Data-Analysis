The Canadiens said Boudrias died Tuesday in Whistler. A cause of death wasn't given.
From Montreal, Boudrias spent most of his early professional career in the Canadiens' farm system, before being dealt to the Minnesota North Stars on the day of the 1967 expansion draft. He had 151 goals and 340 assists in 662 regular-season games with Montreal, Minnesota, Chicago, St. Louis and Vancouver, scoring a career-high 30 goals for the Canucks in 1972-73.
Boudrias finished his playing career with Quebec in the WHA, helping the Nordiques win the 1977 Avco Cup. He had 22 goals and 48 assists in 140 games in two seasons for Quebec.
After retiring as a player, he joined Montreal's scouting department and spent 12 years as an assistant general manager to Serge Savard, helping the Canadiens win Stanley Cup titles in 1986 and 1993. Boudrias joined the New Jersey Devils as a scout in 1994 and helped them win titles in 1995, 2000 and 2003.

Players from both teams hastily waved for the training staff as Edler lay motionless at the side of the Canucks net. With a bloodied face and dazed look, a conscious Edler was wheeled off on a stretcher while sitting upright after a delay of several minutes.

25931164,"It'll happen, deafeningly, when John Tavares returns to face the New York Islanders later this month. It happened, bizarrely (given that his departure was via trade), when Ryan McDonagh returned to face the New York Rangers recently. And Ilya Kovalchuk expects it will happen when the Los Angeles Kings visit the Devils on Tuesday night (7 p.m. ET, streaming on ESPN+), the first time the veteran winger is due to face his former team in New Jersey since he broke his contract and left for Russia's Kontinental Hockey League in 2013.
""I am pretty sure there will be a lot of booing, but I love that, so it's all good,"" he said after the Kings' win over the Rangers on Monday night. As predictions go, this is a five-star, lead-pipe lock.
Walk around any game at Prudential Center and there will be one or two Devils fans with No. 17 jerseys and ""TRAITOR"" taped over Kovalchuk's nameplate, years after he left. They're still angry. They're still resentful. But the question is, should they really feel that way about Ilya Kovalchuk?
To reset the history: The Devils acquired Kovalchuk at the 2010 trade deadline from the Atlanta Thrashers (RIP), and then signed him to one of the most lucrative unrestricted free-agent contracts in history: 17 years and $102 million, an absurd cap-circumventing and eventually illegal contract that saw the last five years pay him $550,000 annually. The NHL rejected it, and the Devils revised the deal to 15 years and $100 million.
Kovalchuk would play 222 games with the Devils from 2010 to 2013, scoring 201 points and leading them to the Stanley Cup Final in 2012 with 19 points in 23 playoff games, at one point very much in the Conn Smythe Trophy conversation.
Scoring leader Nikita Kucherov of the Lightning has charged to the top of the Hart Trophy ranks. Who's ahead for all the major awards?
We grade each team in six areas, identify a class president and student in danger of failing, and issue an overall mark based on preseason expectations.
It's a jumbled mess of teams fighting for the two slots. We debate which clubs will ultimately emerge.
But in July 2013, he was gone. He announced his retirement from the NHL, leaving $77 million on the table, to return to Russia and play for SKA St. Petersburg of the Kontinental Hockey League. The Devils terminated his contract, but retained his rights until last summer, when Kovalchuk was free to return to the NHL and sign with whomever he chose. (And he chose the team that defeated the Devils for the Cup in 2012, the Kings.)
Why did he leave? It was a combination of seeing the writing on the wall for a post-Martin Brodeur Devils franchise; his palpable anger towards the NHL after the 2012 lockout, and about issues like escrow in general; and his desire to bring his family back to Russia and become the face of the KHL for the oligarchs who more than made up for the money he left back in the NHL.
Who didn't stop him from leaving? The Devils.
They could have prevented him from going to Russia. They could have used IIHF transfer rules to block him from returning to the KHL. But they didn't, because Ilya Kovalchuk leaving was inherently good for the franchise:
• It saved them $77 million on the life of the contract.
• They didn't even lose the first-round pick that the NHL was going to dock them for the 17-year contract rejection. It's almost as if then-GM Lou Lamoriello was confident about this in not surrendering any late-round picks that could have settled the debt.
• It saved them enormously on cap recapture penalties. Keep in mind that Kovalchuk was always going to leave for Russia, likely around 2019 when the base salary of his 15-year contract dropped to $4 million. He signed his deal before the 2012 CBA made that type of contract toxic through the cap recapture clause, in which teams are penalized with dead cap space for contracts that give them a ""cap benefit"" on a long-term deal. Essentially, each year there's a difference between the player's salary and his cap hit, the money is tabulated for an eventual penalty if the player retires before that contract ends.
(Please recall Roberto Luongo's infamous ""my contract sucks"" declaration when the Vancouver Canucks struggled to move him.)
In the case of Kovalchuk, his departure to Russia saved the Devils enormously. Depending on when he left, the Devils could have been on the hook for multiple years at $5 million of dead cap space. To put things in perspective: That's an Andy Greene of dead cap space.
By leaving in Year 4 of his 15-year deal, Kovalchuk bailed the Devils out of a toxic contract. They have a cap recapture penalty of just $250,000 annually through 2025. That's couch-cushion small change in the NHL. He did them an enormous favor, and perhaps it's not a coincidence that Lamorielllo let him walk without a fight.
• Also, Lamoriello hated this contract. Then-owner Jeff Vanderbeek pushed him to re-sign Kovalchuk, and Lamoriello handed out a contract that he loathed and predicted would eventually have deleterious effects. ""I would agree we shouldn't have these. But I'm also saying that because it's legal and this is something that ownership felt comfortable doing for the right reasons,"" he said when Kovalchuk signed for 17 years.

If you want to boo anyone, boo the former owner who pushed for a contract that ended up becoming a toxic asset. Boo the NHL's collective bargaining avarice, which jaded Kovalchuk and created a logical pathway through cap recapture for him to return to Russia years before it was contractually predicted he would. Boo the decision to trade for Kovalchuk in the first place, which did as much to disenchant franchise poster boy Zach Parise -- a top-line left wing who saw the team acquire another top-line left wing -- as the draw of moving to Minnesota did when he left for the Wild in 2012.
Booing Kovalchuk would be booing someone who put pen to paper to commit to the Devils, who had one of the best postseasons by any forward in franchise history to push them to an unlikely Stanley Cup Final appearance, and whose ""abandonment"" of the franchise saved them countless millions in salary cap penalties and, undoubtedly, years of physical decline after his peak.
That's frankly something to cheer. And these are obviously better reasons for leaving than, you know, having slept under bedsheets with another team's logo on them as a child. Right, Islanders fans?

25901122,"The Penguins acquired the two forwards from the Florida Panthers for forward Derick Brassard, Riley Sheahan and three 2019 draft picks Friday.
The Penguins landed two useful forwards and moved Derick Brassard off the books. Here's how both GMs did in the swap.
We grade each team in six areas, identify a class president and student in danger of failing, and issue an overall mark based on preseason expectations.
The NHL's trade deadline is now less than a month away. Victoria Matiash takes a look at some of the likeliest candidates to be moved, and the fantasy ramifications if they are.
Bjugstad, 26, and McCann, 22, made it to PPG Paints Arena minutes before the puck drop in Pittsburgh's 5-3 win over the Ottawa Senators.
They both took the morning skate with the Panthers and boarded a plane to Pittsburgh when they learned of the trade. They received a police escort and arrived at the arena before faceoff, still with their Panthers equipment bags as they hurried to join their teammates on the ice.
Bjugstad and McCann first appeared on the bench before the start of the national anthem.
""Showing up at game time was interesting and might have been better for us because there wasn't much thinking,"" said Bjugstad, who contributed an assist and won the offensive zone faceoff in his first game with the Penguins. ""It was pretty surreal. We showed up to the rink and just played. I have dreams every once in awhile where I'm late to a game, and that's kind of what it felt like, but luckily it ended up well, so it was good.
""Usually I have my coffee and do some stretches, but I didn't have any of that. We got here, threw our gear on and ran out for the anthem.""
Bjugstad, who is signed through the 2020-21 season at an average of $4.1 million per year, has five goals and seven assists in 32 games for the Panthers this season. McCann, signed through the 2019-20 season at an average of $1.25 million, has eight goals and 10 assists in 46 contests with Florida.
Panthers general manager Dale Tallon said it was difficult to part with Bjugstad and McCann.
""You've got to put the personal feelings aside and do what's right for the franchise,"" Tallon said. ""It's hard to do sometimes, but necessary.""
The deal ends Pittsburgh's experiment in attempting to make Brassard, 31, the team's third-line center. Acquired in a deal with Ottawa last season, Brassard struggled to generate much offense during his brief time with the Penguins, collecting just 12 goals in 64 games with Pittsburgh.
Sheahan, 27, brought over in a trade with Detroit early in the 2017-18 season, had 18 goals and 23 assists in 122 games with the Penguins. Brassard and Sheahan both have expiring contracts, and the Panthers -- who are trying to get back into the Eastern Conference playoff hunt -- might move them again before the Feb. 25 trading deadline.
Brassard, who has also played for the Senators, Rangers and Blue Jackets since being drafted in 2006, has 443 career points.
""We'll go game-by-game and week-by-week and then we'll decide before the deadline what we're going to do,"" Tallon said.
Pittsburgh also sent a second-round pick and two fourth-round picks in the 2019 draft to the Panthers to complete the deal.

25993116,"""I went through a contract thing when I was going to Switzerland that was a debacle. Much more stressful than this,"" he said.
Matthews and his family made the decision to have him bring his talents to the Zurich Lions in 2015. It would be a year of professional seasoning for the consensus choice for first overall pick in the 2016 NHL draft. But the hoops he had to jump through to play there would have intimidated a Westminster show dog: earning ""specialist status"" to enter and work in the country, and then needing to take his GED exam to have graduated high school and be eligible for the season.

Pettersson is quickly adjusting to the spotlight for a Canucks team that has found itself in the Western Conference playoff hunt.
""It was an eight- or nine-hour test. Not a big school guy. My little sister is in high school now, and I look at her homework sometimes, and it absolutely looks like Chinese to me,"" he said with a laugh.
The immigration and academic issues of that contract made the negotiations on his blockbuster extension with the Maple Leafs seem quaint by comparison. ""I wouldn't say [it's a] relief, it's just another step,"" Matthews said.
But it was a monumental step for the 21-year-old star center. Matthews signed a five-year $58.17 million contract on Feb. 5 that runs through 2024, for an $11.634 million average annual value. It's impossible not to trace the ripples around the NHL from this decision. It's as if someone dropped a boulder worth 14.6 percent of the current salary cap in the middle of a previously serene lake.
His contract affects the crop of restricted free agents this summer, both in their negotiations with their own teams and in the salary structures for potential offer-sheet poachers.
""We had to presume that with Connor [McDavid] being locked up, and with Auston as the next big deal, that it would have influence on the marketplace,"" Matthews' agent, Judd Moldaver, told ESPN this week. ""So it's like Spider-Man: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' Ultimately, my job is his happiness, but there's no question his deal is going to be looked at [by other players].""
It affects Mitch Marner, his Leafs teammate and pending restricted free agent, whose contract will follow that of Matthews. ""We don't talk about it much. It's not something that comes up much,"" said Matthews, who said he wasn't concerned that his decision would impact Marner's deal.
""When we do talk, it's not even hockey-related. It's a big thing in the media, but it's not something either of us stress too much in our minds. We just want to go out there and play hockey. We have agents for that stuff.""

It obviously affects the Maple Leafs the most, because whatever contract Matthews signed would influence everything from their cap management to their personnel decisions. This is what made Matthews' negotiation different from that of McDavid's: The latter is an extraterrestrial talent whose team was going to pay him anything he asked to build around him, for he is the franchise; the Leafs, at least in the eyes of general manager Kyle Dubas and team president Brendan Shanahan, see Matthews as a franchise player but not as the franchise. Keeping him, and keeping him away from offer sheets, was vital. But it wouldn't come at the expense of the contender they were constructing.
The term that Matthews and his representatives -- agents Moldaver and Jeff Jackson of Wasserman (which also represents McDavid) as well as his father, Brian Matthews -- wanted was philosophically different from what the Leafs were determined to get.
""Of course, he coveted an eight-year term. He's committed to the Toronto Maple Leafs, and that would have been something he would have loved to have seen through,"" Moldaver said. ""But we got to a point where, based on the complicated cap puzzle the Leafs have and in a hard-cap system, it became increasingly obvious that an eight-year term to serve his interests and the Leafs' interests just wasn't going to be right. And this was discussed amicably. Essentially, we looked at everything from three to eight years.""
The three-year option was a nonstarter because that would have been too much risk for Matthews and too high an average annual value for the Leafs to cover that risk. The eight-year term would have also yielded a cap hit that was too high, as it would have gobbled up additional unrestricted free-agent seasons.
""This is just the nature of the way deals are in hockey. If you want the longer term, you're also taking out more of their prime. The AAV rises. Certainly, that was the intention from the beginning on Auston's side. They were focused on that,"" Dubas said. ""We're trying to balance keeping this together with contending and not having to delete parts from it. We're very grateful they were willing to move off their desired term and maintain some flexibility.""
So the term became five years. Matthews sold it as ""a lot of guys have done five years before,"" which isn't necessarily accurate. Every first overall pick from 2008 through 2016 has signed a second contract of six or more seasons, save for two: Nail Yakupov, who is no longer in the NHL, and Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning, who signed a five-year deal worth 11.66 percent of the cap in 2011 before following it with an eight-year deal in 2016 to avoid free agency, worth 11.64 percent of the cap (a trajectory that Matthews seems to be on).
But here's the thing about first overall picks: Many of them are still on lousy or average teams after three seasons, which is to say that none of them signed their second contracts after their team signed the premier free agent on the market to a seven-year deal worth $77 million, as the Leafs did with John Tavares.

""Business trends change. Circumstances change. There are soon going to be 32 teams. Everyone has the same goal. But their business, the current status of their team -- if they're in a rebuild, if they're close to winning a championship -- and their marketplace influences how they run things,"" Moldaver said. ""The Leafs have a puzzle, no doubt, [when] a superstar player in John Tavares signs as an unrestricted free agent.""
So Dubas and the Leafs presented the puzzle thusly to Matthews: Five years keeps the team together with a window to win the Stanley Cup. That's where your piece fits best.
""We want to give ourselves the maximum number of chances we can to make a real good go at it,"" Dubas said.
Every good general manager understands his player's pressure points, and the one Matthews has isn't all that unique: He wants to win. Badly.
""In terms of the term, we considered everything. The Leafs were classy to deal with, but of course you're negotiating hard. Our job is to serve Auston's interest. He wanted a great deal, and our mandate was to give him as such. But the most important thing to him is that he wants to win. So his real only mandate was, 'Hey, let's do a great deal that helps the team as much as possible,'"" Moldaver said. ""As skilled as he is, I think Auston Matthews' greatest asset is his desire to win. Not to just talk about it, but to do it.""
Could he have gotten eight years and still won in Toronto? ""If Auston would have done an eight-year deal too, I don't think it would have decreased the chances of the team being successful, in a certain version of things. But in the reality of where they were at, it just made sense,"" Moldaver said.

There's no predicting if the Leafs will win the Stanley Cup within a six-year span -- this postseason and the next five years of Matthews' deal. There's really only one certainty after that: Matthews' contract will end with him facing unrestricted free agency in the summer of 2024.
Some pundits felt that term made this contract a loss for the Leafs. ""I'm amazed that it's five years. I don't know how this makes sense for anybody in the management side. Five ... I want to know how they're going to keep him after five years,"" Brian Burke, former Maple Leafs general manager, said on Sportsnet. ""If that's the price tag that he's got to buy one year of [unrestricted free agent] status, I don't know, given the tax structure in Ontario, how this guy stays one more day after five years. I really don't.""
It has been noted that with this five-year contract, followed by a maximum eight-year deal, Matthews will make an incredible amount of money, while the Maple Leafs would be paying for his prime years rather than paying for ones after it, as they would have with two consecutive eight-year deals. The conspiratorial among us might wonder if this 13-year plan might be something the two sides discussed during these negotiations.
Both Moldaver and Dubas said there was no discussion at all about the next Matthews contract.
""It's our complete intention that Auston will spend his entire career with the Maple Leafs. The execution of that has two dimensions,"" Dubas said via email.
""First, we need to build our program in all regards into a consistently elite one, across all areas, in order to maximize our team potential and the potential of each individual athlete. Second, Auston needs to continue to do all he can to reach his potential on and off the ice as he has in his first 2.5 seasons. We have had no discussion at all about his next contract. We will enjoy the next number of seasons working together, rather than divert our attention to something so far in the future.""
For Matthews, the contract talks are in the past. The terms are settled. He and his representatives feel it's a deal that's both beneficial to him and, ultimately, beneficial to him lifting the Stanley Cup in the near future for the Maple Leafs.
""In the end, you're measured on championships,"" Matthews said. ""And that's what I want to bring to this team.""

25938103,"That doesn't mean general manager David Poile is necessarily finished trying to improve the defending Presidents' Trophy winners. There are still three weeks before the NHL trade deadline. And no matter how happy Poile is with his roster after trading for a pair of veteran forwards in Brian Boyle from New Jersey and Cody McLeod from the Rangers on Wednesday, things can always be better.
The Patriots' Super Bowl win solidifies their spot among the top dynasties in any sport. Who are the NHL's best? Here are the top 10.
Scoring leader Nikita Kucherov of the Lightning has charged to the top of the Hart Trophy ranks. Who's ahead for all the major awards?
Poile plans to keep making calls, listening and paying attention until the deadline Feb. 25.
""I think just look for the right deal,'' Poile said. ""If we can improve our club, we're going to do that. I'm comfortable with what we have in our depth and filling the holes that I thought we had or got created by the three players that we've lost in the last couple weeks. But if we can improve our team in the next three weeks, we will certainly do that.''
The Predators lost defenseman Anthony Bitetto to a waiver claim to Minnesota on Jan. 25, trying to sneak him to the AHL for some playing time. Forward Austin Watson was suspended indefinitely Jan. 29 under the NHL's substance abuse program. Poile announced Wednesday that forward Zac Rinaldo will have season-ending surgery for an injured shoulder.
Nashville center Kyle Turris has missed 17 straight games but could return Thursday against Dallas or this weekend in a back-to-back, home-and-home series with St. Louis. Forward Miikka Salomaki also may be closing to a return from an injury.
Poile swapped the Predators' second-round pick in June's NHL draft for Boyle and will send the Rangers a seventh-round pick in the 2020 NHL draft for McLeod. That was prompted by a worst-case scenario of Watson possibly not returning this season.
That filled the Predators' most immediate need -- size -- with Boyle, a 6-foot-6, 245-pound forward who can play center and wing, and the 6-2, 245-pound McLeod. That should help Nashville better match up with Winnipeg, which ousted the Predators in the second round in seven games last postseason.
""This year it will have to be through Winnipeg,'' Poile said. ""There are no guarantees that's the case, but yes ... I think we wanted to have more size in our lineup.''
Both Boyle and McLeod should be in Nashville and available Thursday night when the Predators host Dallas.
Boyle, 34, has 13 goals and 19 points in his 12th NHL season, and he also has 88 hits in 47 games with New Jersey this season. Boyle won the 2017 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy after battling chronic myeloid leukemia.
The center originally was drafted 26th overall  by Los Angeles in the 2003 draft held in Nashville, and he has played 740 career NHL games with 211 points. He also has blocked 513 shots and 1,498 hits and played in the Stanley Cup Final in 2014 with the New York Rangers and 2015 with Tampa Bay. Boyle has 28 points in 111 career postseason games.
Better yet, Boyle scored five power-play goals last season and has six this season, which Poile noted is more than anyone on the Nashville roster. The Predators ended an 0-for-34 drought with the man advantage Tuesday night in a win over Arizona and still went 1-for-5 on the power play.
Poile has regretted losing McLeod since Nashville waived him in January 2018, trying to get the veteran more playing time with Milwaukee in the AHL only to lose him. McLeod's wife and two children remained in Nashville, and McLeod, 34, has a goal and 60 penalty minutes in 31 games this season with the Rangers.
""Hopefully together we can do something real significant this year in the playoffs,'' Poile said.

In fact, one could argue he's already better than the vast number of goaltenders Philadelphia has skated out to the crease through the years ... before they skate back to the bench after they're lit up.
So, we decided to test that theory.
The 20-year-old has saved the Flyers' 2018-19 season. What comes next? Plus, a dark-horse candidate for the NHL's most improved player.
The Avalanche have a fun-loving breakout star on their hands. Here's what comes next for the high-scoring 22-year-old Finn.
There has been some shuffling in the top 10 for this week. Plus, the most impressive 23-and-under player for every club this season.
Here's a ranking of every Philadelphia Flyers goaltender ... ever. Please keep in mind that we're only judging these goalies' time with the Flyers, and not their overall careers. We decided to make the cut-off 16 games, which is the extent of the Carter Hart Era as of this writing. So first, please pour some Wawa raspberry iced tea out for the many, the proud, the honorable mentions who fell short of that minimum:
Alex Lyon, Calvin Pickard, Rob Zepp, Bruce Hoffort, Gary Inness, Wendell Young, Robbie Moore, Frederic Chabot, Don McLeod, Michel Larocque, Neil Little, Maxime Ouellet, Johan Backlund, Marc D'Amour, Jeremy Duchesne, Cal Heeter, Martin Houle, Mike McKenna, Jerome Mrazek, Jean-Marc Pelletier and the impossibly named Dunc Wilson.
And now, here is the definitive ranking of Flyers goalies before Hart's inevitable rise to No. 1. Stats are via the incredible Hockey Reference. Enjoy!
38. Stephane Beauregard (1992-93): Best remembered for being a hockey card I'd regret getting with the Winnipeg Jets, Beauregard was 3-9-0 with a .854 save percentage and a 4.41 GAA in 16 games for the Flyers. That's a minus-12.39 goals saved above average, folks!
37. Petr Mrazek (2017-18): It's never a good thing when the goalie a team acquires to stabilize its injury-riddled netminding corps manages to make it even less stable with a putrid .297 quality starts percentage in 17 games.
36. Bobby Taylor (1971-76): An AHL player who made a series of cameo appearances over the course of five years. His longest run was 23 games in 1972-73 when he had a .888 save percentage.
35. Mark LaForest (1987-89): Couldn't see LaForest through the threes ... like that .873 save percentage and that 3.91 goals-against average.
34. Anthony Stolarz (2016-present): The anti-Carter Hart: a player who jumped up from the AHL and made the team worse.
33. Tommy Soderstrom (1992-94): An 11th-round draft pick (!) who managed to make the NHL for five inconsistent seasons. He followed an OK rookie campaign with a 34-game 1993-94 that saw him post a minus-26.71 goals above average.
32. Michel Belhumeur (1972-73): He played 23 games and finished 9-7-3 (.903 save percentage) with an 85-point team, which was promising ... but not promising enough to keep him out of the 1974 expansion draft, as he was claimed by the Washington Capitals. There, he went [checks notes] [checks them again] [allows slacked jaw to hit the table] 0-24-3 in their 8-67-5 debut season.
31. Rick St. Croix (1977-82): He had a .886 save percentage in 82 games over six years for the Flyers. Arguably their best goalie whose name also sounds like a flavored seltzer. (Second place: Rob Zepp.)
30. Garth Snow (1995-97): The 30th-best goalie in Flyers history, but at least the second-best goalie who would become an NHL general manager.
29. Sean Burke (1997-98, 2003-04): During one of the weirder careers of the past 30 years -- from phenom to Whaler to journeyman -- Burke had two tours of duty with the Flyers, neither of them good: he had a total record of 13-8-2 with a .911 save percentage in 26 games.
28. Phil Myre (1979-81): A longtime goalie for the Atlanta Flames (RIP) and a pretty subpar one for the Flyers (.872 save percentage). No need to wallow in this Myre.
27. Glenn Resch (1985-87): Chico! He spent the last two years of his eclectic NHL career with the Flyers, posting a .900 save percentage in 22 games before retiring for a life of awkward asides about arena sausages during the action as a Devils announcer.

26. Ray Emery (2009-10, 2013-15): The late NHL netminder was a beloved figure in Philly sports, and the feeling was mutual, but he didn't have his most effective seasons with the Flyers (35-34-10, .901 save percentage). His last NHL season, at age 32, was spent in orange and black.
25. Darren Jensen (1984-86): The Flyers were the only NHL stop for Jensen, who posted a 15-10-1 record with a .879 save percentage in 30 games. Despite that, he earned a share of the Jennings Trophy in 1985-86 before finishing the decade in the minors.
24. Ilya Bryzgalov (2011-13): [Bryz Voice] ""THERE ARE ONLY THREE THINGS YOU SHOULD FEAR IN ALL OF LIFE. BEARS. THE VASTNESS OF THE UNIVERSE. AND SIGNING 31-YEAR-OLD GOALIES TO NINE-YEAR CONTRACTS BECAUSE THEY'LL GO 52-33-10 WITH A .905 SAVE PERCENTAGE AND YOU BUY THEM OUT TWO YEARS LATER."" [/Bryz Voice]
23. Jeff Hackett (2003-04): The Flyers were the last stop in the journeyman's NHL career, as he spent 27 games with Philly and posted a .905 save percentage. There have been worse.
22. Brian Elliott (2017-19): An entirely competent and average goalie whose 57-game Flyers career has been undercut by injuries. He's 29-18-7 with a .909 save percentage.
21. Michal Neuvirth (2015-19): The Flyers have had a lot of Michal Neuvirths through the years: Goalies who are a 1-A at best, a semi-competent backup at worst. He had a couple of decent seasons sandwiched around a horrendous one in 2016-17 (minus-13.29 goals saved above average), but mostly injuries have defined his legacy.
20. Michael Leighton (2006-07, 2009-13): Infamous for playing nearly half as many playoff games for the Flyers (16) as he played regular-season games (33), and for being the guy who gave up that overtime Stanley Cup-winning goal to Patrick Kane in 2010. Wasn't terrible, outside of that.
19. Bruce Gamble (1970-72): In the infinite oddness of Flyers goaltending, Gamble's story ranks up there: After playing 35 (mainly lackluster) games with Philadelphia, it was discovered that he had a heart attack during a Feb. 8, 1972, game and his NHL career was over. He passed away in 1982 after another heart attack following a practice with his beer league team.
18. Carter Hart (2019): Here are the facts: Hart is 10-5-1 with a .925 save percentage, a 2.48 goals-against average and a plus-8.78 goals saved above average. He's answered the hype and sparked the team's comeback in the Eastern Conference wild-card race. As you can see from the names behind him, it's not completely outlandish that the 20-year-old novice is one of the top 18 goalies in franchise history already. If only because he hasn't played enough in Philadelphia to prove otherwise.
17. Dominic Roussel (1991-95): The epitome of ""just ... there."" Had one season as a starter and the next season Ron Hextall was back.
16. Antero Niittymaki (2003-04, 2005-09): He spent 161 games in Philadelphia as that backup goalie who has two good weeks and then everyone wonders if he should be the starter, and then, nope, wait, he's very much not good enough to be one. This happened at least a half-dozen times as a Flyer. His only year as a full-fledged starter (2006-07) saw him post a minus-17.51 goals saved above replacement in 52 games on a Ken Hitchcock team, no less.
15. Robert Esche (2002-07): I just remember Esche looking enormous in goal for some reason. Two good seasons, including a share of the Jennings Trophy, and two bad seasons, and then off to Russia.
14. Sergei Bobrovsky (2010-12): Hey, remember how we were going to only judge these goalies by their time with the Flyers? Well, technically we're doing that here, because 42-23-10 in 83 games with a .909 save percentage -- and that .848 playoff save percentage, yuck -- are no great shakes. But it's impossible here not to acknowledge the juxtaposition between what he'd become with Columbus and whatever this was in Philly.
13. John Vanbiesbrouck (1998-2000): It's said that timing is everything in goaltending. Getting Beezer well past his prime is a good example: a .904 save percentage in 112 games, although he did have one good playoff series in defeat in 1999.
12. Brian Boucher (1999-02, 2009-11, 2012-13): Yes, that's three different tours of duty with the Flyers. We'll give Tour 1, including a dynamic rookie season, a 'B-plus.' We'll give Tour 2, which lasted 67 games and included their run to the Stanley Cup Final, a 'B.' We'll give Tour 3, just four games with the Flyers after a desperation trade and the rest in the AHL, a 'D.'
11. Ken Wregget (1988-92): Prior to winning a Stanley Cup with the Penguins, Wregget was the Flyers' starter in 1989-90 (a great season with a plus-16.43 goals saved above average) and a capable backup the rest of his 107 games in Philly. Great mustache, too.
10. Wayne Stephenson (1975-79): Best known for taking the reins from Bernie Parent in 1975-76 after Parent's preseason neck injury. Otherwise, he was Parent's backup, and an OK one at that.
9. Steve Mason (2012-17): Mason resurrected his career in Philly, full-stop. He played 231 games and posted a 104-78-36 record with a .918 save percentage. In four full seasons, he was outstanding in two of them, OK in one of them and terrible in his last year. But that adds up to one of the best, and most underappreciated, runs for a Flyers goalie, even with the occasional ""indescribably bad goal.""
8. Martin Biron (2007-09): The dreamiest eyes in NHL goaltending history and one of the best three-season goalie runs in Flyers history; he went 65-47-16 with a .915 save percentage. That included a plus-16.42 goals saved above average in 62 games during 2007-08. The playoffs were another story, as he gave up a postseason-high 52 goals in 17 games during the 2008 run.

Listen »
7. Pete Peeters (1978-82, 1989-91): Peeters had an 85-57-20 record with the Flyers. His .888 save percentage wasn't great, but he put together two tremendous seasons out of his first three, finishing third in the 1980 Calder voting. He wasn't atrocious, either, in his return to Philly in his final two NHL seasons. Great chant-able name, too: ""PEEEEEE-TERRRRS.""
6. Roman Cechmanek (2001-03): The Evgeni Nabokov of the Flyers. His regular-season numbers were stellar: 92-43-22, .923 save percentage (well above average) and a 1.96 GAA in his 163 games as a Flyer. He even earned a share of the Jennings Trophy in 2002-03. But in the playoffs, he was 9-15 with a .909 save percentage, and every time he attempted to play the puck, they could have piped in circus music through the arena speakers.
5. Bob Froese (1982-86): Having a goalie whose name sounds like ""froze"" was always amazing to me as a child. ""He Froese the puck,"" and all of that. Anyhoo, he was simply one of the most effective goalies in Flyers history when given the chance, with a .899 save percentage (in the 1980s, remember) and a 92-29-12 record. He led the league with 31 wins and a .909 save percentage in 1985-86 and finished second for the Vezina. He was traded for Kjell Samuelsson of the Rangers and faded into his 30s. Basically Cechmanek before there was a Chechmanek.
4. Doug Favell (1967-73): He's fourth in games played for Philly goalies (215) and had a pretty outstanding run on some not-very-outstanding teams, especially in his last two seasons when he had around a .916 save percentage in both. Would be best remembered for missing most of the 1969-70 season with a dressing-room injury were it not for the fact that he was the guy they traded for Bernie Parent.
3. Pelle Lindbergh (1981-86): One of the most tragic ""what-ifs"" in hockey history. Lindbergh was 26 when he died in a car accident on Nov. 10, 1985. He was also coming off a career-redefining season: a Vezina Trophy, third for the Hart and a goals saved above average of plus-47.41 in 65 games. With two outstanding years out of three, that's enough to validate his standing on this ranking.
2. Ron Hextall (1986-92, 1994-99): A Philadelphia legend, if not a Hockey Hall of Fame immortal. 240 wins, a Vezina and a Conn Smythe as a rookie in 1987 (losing the Calder to Luc Robitaille) and several seasons where he exceeded the play of the team around him. Also, he would hit guys in the face with his goalie stick. Would have probably won a mayoral election were it not for the presumed citizenship requirements.
1. Bernie Parent (1967-71, 1973-79): What are the greatest moments in Flyers history? Back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975. Who won the Vezina Trophy and the Conn Smythe in both of those seasons en route to 231 wins with Philly in a Hall of Fame career? This guy. Clearly the best goalie in Flyers history, or as he's known around here, ""keeping the seat warm for Carter Hart.""
We're moving this feature from Tuesday into the Friday column beginning this week. For the uninformed, it's the spot where we celebrate one pro, college, youth or beer league player for having the best week out of every hockey player in the world.
And the best player in the world of the week is ...
Adrian Kempe of the Los Angeles Kings. As reader Billy T. notes: ""Yeah, his season has been bad, Kings have been bad, and before the back to back wins Monday and Tuesday against the Rangers and Devils, he had just 5 goals and 13 points in 50 games."" In his past three games, Kempe has four goals and an assist, after failing to score a goal since Dec. 11.
Oh, and he's got that flow:

The Auston Matthews signing was the biggest news of the week, and we had Sportsnet insider Chris Johnson on to break it all down.

I feel for Mitch Marner.
First, Auston Matthews decides to take a five-year deal at an average annual value of 14.6 percent of the current salary cap rather than swinging for the fences on an eight-year deal like most of his peers have. Great for Auston, who will be able to sign that blockbuster, UFA-years-gobbling contract after six seasons. Bad for Mitch, who certainly can't get that max deal, who saw the ceiling for his average annual value lowered by Matthews' contract and who watched his agent go off on the inequity of that contract and then have to walk back his comments with the backward dexterity of Michael Jackson doing the moonwalk at Motown 25.
But John Tavares got paid and Matthews got paid and even William Nylander got paid after staring down the Leafs for months, and now it feels like Marner's the guy who'll need to be a team player and take a short-term contract with a smaller cap hit for the betterment of the Leafs. Yet all he's doing this season is leading them in scoring.
Frankly, it's the curse of the nice guy, which Marner unfailingly is. He's a charming goofball who looks like he should be on the cover of Canadian Tiger Beat magazine. His agent thinks he should get Matthews money and his father probably thinks he should get more, but Mitch is just happy to play hockey, happy to be a Leaf, happy to do commercials, happy to get hugs from the mascot. Even if he got an offer sheet, he probably wouldn't sign it, because that would be mean.
He'll eventually break the bank after a few more years of riding shotgun for Tavares. But for now, he's taking a discount, no matter what his agent says. He's too nice not to.
The NHL dispatched some of its mascots to Washington, D.C., this week for the Congressional Hockey Challenge, including our sentient orange mop from Philadelphia. He was the belle of this ball, taking pictures with assorted Congress people, accepting a marriage proposal from a local television reporter and remaining vigilant against Penguins fans:

25947292,"Due to numbers (and lack of a goaltender), the Ice Lions had nobody to play but themselves. Over the summer, Tim Horton's flew the Ice Lions to Canada, outfitted them in fresh gear and organized a game with NHL superstars Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon. The video produced, ""The Away Game,"" quickly went viral. In late October, Tim Horton's flew the Ice Lions' captain, Ben Azegere, back to Toronto to watch his first NHL game and reunite with Crosby. When asked what it meant to him at the time, Azegere said, ""Anything is possible. And every dream is valid.""Editor's PicksThe only women's ice hockey team in KenyaMeet Tasha Otieno, Faith Wambui and Alexcy Wambui. They are part of the Nairobi Ice Lions -- the sole women's hockey squad in Kenya -- and they are fighting for a place in the sport they love.
Meet Tasha Otieno, Faith Wambui and Alexcy Wambui. They are part of the Nairobi Ice Lions -- the sole women's hockey squad in Kenya -- and they are fighting for a place in the sport they love.
It was a heartwarming story underscoring the universal language of sport. It was also an acute reminder of hockey's cost prohibitions and aspirations for inclusivity.
The Ice Lions returned to Kenya, their normal jobs, their normal routines, but not their normal practices. Tim Colby, a Canadian living in Nairobi who serves as the Ice Lions' coach and adviser, noticed something different about the players after their North American exposure.
""The energy level they came back with -- they were flying, throwing their bodies around like crazy,"" Colby says. ""I don't wear equipment when I play, and now I'm telling myself I might need to.""
The regular players -- who were resourceful with limited gear, often taping pieces of couch cushions to themselves -- now have donated full CCM sets, perhaps giving them more security. But they still lack what so many established teams take for granted.
When pucks and sticks inevitably get to the face? That's a problem. A few weeks ago, a player sustained a cut; Colby was applying antibiotic cream when he realized he didn't have medical gloves to properly apply it. When you have players at varying levels, checking from behind is a concern. Colby might institute a full face-mask rule. He's also working to send players to a Red Cross training course, or at least some online video training.
There's no defibrillator at the rink, nor a trainer. The hotel has a doctor and nurse on call, but the team is still working out a protocol for how and when to call them. In Kenya, if you have a serious injury, you don't necessarily wait for an ambulance. You get in the car and go yourself. Not everyone is covered by insurance. What hospital do you go to? Who has a credit card? Now Colby and the other team leaders are figuring out procedures. They might require players to have insurance if they get on the ice, and if they can't afford it, they'll work out how to subsidize it.
In 2016, Azegere approached Colby and asked if he would help them establish a program and get them to the next level.
""I was sitting on the bench thinking, 'No f---ing way,'"" Colby says. ""I knew the amount of administration that it takes. It's not just getting the guys ready on the ice. I tried explaining, every team has more off-ice people than on-ice people.""
But Colby, whose day job is with the United Nations Development Programme, couldn't resist. He saw how much hockey meant to these players; many traveled hours just to get to the rink or were spending their last dime to get there. So he said yes. He and a group of four or five meet after they play hockey and go over things. They're getting started and, thanks to the publicity boost with the Tim Horton's campaign, have a better foundation. But there's still much work to be done.
The Ice Lions host two main shinny games a week, plus four different training sessions, partially broken up by age. There's enough donated equipment now for the regular players, but not at the youth level yet. In all, there are about 30 Kenyan regulars who come.
Tim Horton's donated $30,000 Canadian dollars to the Ice Lions, and Alibaba, a Chinese conglomerate, also donated $30,000 (USD). But the program hasn't dipped into that money yet, partially because they can't access it.

Corporations can't just give individuals money, and the Ice Lions are dealing with the bureaucracy of setting up a federation. They hope to reach affiliate status by the end of 2019 (or maybe sometime in 2020), but in the meantime, they can't set up a bank account.
After the Tim Horton's campaign, there was a huge demand for jerseys. A man in Toronto volunteered to set up a Web page, print them and ship them, all for free. They looked sharp: the same kelly green with red-striped trimming that Crosby & Co. wore in the game, featuring a regal lion holding a hockey stick in the center. They weren't cheap ($169) but sold out immediately. So far, there have been about 300 sold, and the Ice Lions receive $100 for every sale.
That's given them the largest chunk of accessible cash, plus the GoFundMe, which Colby describes as their ""financial lifeline."" They've raised more than $7,000 on the page, although after an initial surge this fall, momentum has slowed.
""We haven't really spent any of our money yet,"" Colby says. ""And we're about to have to.""
The Ice Lions have a wishlist, and topping it is a new skate-sharpening machine (their current one has long been on the fritz). But the first tangible goal is to send a handful of Ice Lions out to Canada for coaching clinics to earn certification. While there, the Kenyans would spend every evening at a youth hockey practice, then study during the day and leave with a first-level coaching certificate. Colby lined up some people who can host as billets, and they have enough money to give per diems.
The big cost is airfare. Because most of the players work and have families, they're also trying to figure out their schedules before they can book. Ultimately, Colby wants to hand everything over to the Kenyans. As someone who specializes in intercultural relations, he understands that for long-term sustainability, the Kenyans ""need to own"" the coaching aspect.
""I understand that it will take a bit longer for them on the administrative and operational side, which I'm doing a lot of,"" Colby says. ""But I want them to own the coaching for many reasons. In my business, you learn that different cultures have different ways of doing things. It's not like going from IBM to Ford and finding an organization of cultural differences compared to the West. It's much better if they take on all of the coaching, and they take care of everything they can, down to the theories of how to run a practice better to make it more efficient, the progression of drills, how to manage, et cetera. If they own that, it will be much better for them, and much more sustainable.""
The buzz around the Ice Lions has been global. A Swiss photojournalist recently visited. A Finnish reporter swung by last week. A visiting tourist from somewhere in the midwestern United States brought three bags of equipment for the female players. A Mississauga (Canada) man who owns a trucking company offered warehouse space in Toronto in which the Ice Lions can store donated equipment before it is shipped over. In March, the Ice Lions will host Slava Fetisov and Mike Richter as part of their version of ""The Last Game,"" an initiative to raise awareness on climate change.
Rick Lipsey, a former Sports Illustrated writer, coaches his son's 10-and-under squirt team in Manhattan. Looking to inspire his players, Lipsey arranged a Skype call between his players and the Ice Lions.
Postgame analysis and highlight show airing each night throughout the season from Barry Melrose and Linda Cohn. Watch on ESPN+
""They made it clear on the call how hard they work just to get to the rink, and they appreciate just the ability to play hockey,"" Lipsey says. ""I think that really struck some of our players."" So the North Park Hockey Squirt Green team wears Kenya Ice Lion stickers on their helmets, and the boys participate in a program where they solicit donations and pledges for the Ice Lions: small things, like a dollar for a goal, or 50 cents for a win. Every dollar counts.
As for the Ice Lions themselves, Colby has seen continued interest. They're seeing more regular practice attendance. After Azegere's last trip to Canada, he brought back goalie equipment. Ice Lions player George Gachara happily volunteered to give it a go in net; after his first few sessions, it turns out, he was a natural. Gachara barely flinched.
Colby usually skates with his family for an hour on Sundays starting at 11 a.m., and he noticed that some Ice Lions players are getting there an hour and a half earlier than their scheduled practice time to set up drills. Colby recently had a breakfast meeting with the GM, and again, even in darkness, saw some players sneaking in ice time.
The hotel has been a great partner, offering more free ice time and space in a storage facility that can be turned into a locker room. But Colby knows they can't abuse the relationship. The rink costs roughly $8,000 USD to operate per month. Some developers have expressed intrigue about building another rink in Nairobi -- it probably would have to be a multipurpose facility -- but as of now, there are no concrete plans.
By this time next year, Colby would like to have a youth team ready to go to a tournament, either in the U.S. or Canada; they've eyed the Bell Capital Cup in Ottawa as a great fit. Colby is also reaching out to players from South Africa, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia to see if they could arrange an African Cup. As of now, it would have to be a 3-on-3 tournament because the ice is so small.
CCM just came through with another 30 full sets of equipment, and the Ice Lions decided it would all go to the youth.
""The older guys, like Ben and them, know this is all about the next generation,"" Colby says. ""Their time in the limelight was in Canada. We'll have some 3-on-3 tournaments here and there, but the big stuff, the international stuff, will all be for the younger guys.""
This is just the start. The Ice Lions plan to be around for generations to come.

Record: 15-16-4 | Hot-seat rating: 10
In the most general sense, Hitchcock replacing Todd McLellan after 20 games this season is an abject failure because it fell short of its one particular objective: saving the job of general manager Peter Chiarelli, who was fired on Jan. 22.
More specifically, it was supposed to turn the Oilers around into a playoff team, and Hitch is running just ahead (.486 points percentage) of where McLellan (.475) had the team. The offense outside of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl is paltry. The goaltending, which Hitchcock used to repair through his mere presence during stints with other teams, is third worst in the NHL (.893 save percentage).
Sure, there's still a chance the Oilers could make the playoffs because the West wild-card race has slightly more teams involved than a March Madness bracket. But even if they did, would the next general manager want Hitchcock as his coach? Or, more to the point, would Hitch want another season of this? (And by ""this,"" we of course mean ""Mikko Koskinen."")
Record: 19-19-4 | Hot-seat rating: 10
Firing John Stevens just 13 games into the season remains a panicky, reactionary, ""Please don't let us slip into the abyss of anonymity while LeBron and the Rams suck up all the air in L.A."" move by management. Whether the Kings would have cycled back up in play with him behind the bench, as they somewhat have for Desjardins, is debatable. That this disaster of a season is a problem with construction -- the Kings being an old, slow team in a young, fast league -- rather than coaching isn't debatable. An interim coach wasn't going to change that.
Record: 13-8-3 | Hot-seat rating: 8
The Flyers were 13-15-4 on Dec. 18. Since then, they've gone 12-8-3. That date may end up being significant in Flyers history. Not because it was the debut of interim coach Scott Gordon, promoted from the AHL after new GM Chuck Fletcher cut loose the old GM's last coaching hire, Dave Hakstol. But instead because it was the NHL debut of another AHL call-up: Carter Hart. Hart has started 17 of Gordon's 24 games as head coach and is responsible for 11 of his 13 wins, with a .926 save percentage and a 2.45 goals-against average.
Gordon deserves credit for parts of this Flyers surge back up the Eastern Conference standings. His approach to the players is a total 180 from the tension convention under Hakstol, for example. But the Flyers are scoring less on average under him (2.83) than they were under Hakstol (3.00), yet they are winning more thanks to the stabilization of their goaltending. Gordon is not the first coach whose success is manufactured by stellar goaltending, but that's the scenario here.
His interim status and the Flyers' tenuous re-entry into playoff contention make his seat a bit toasty as Fletcher looks to make his first coaching hire. But anything goes if the Flyers actually make the cut.
Record: 28-22-5 | Hot-seat rating: 6
Montgomery doesn't have the strongest case for having improved the Stars. Their points percentage (.555) is off last year's pace (.561). Their possession metrics, as well as offensive and defensive numbers at 5-on-5, are down from last season under Ken Hitchcock. One could argue that the year goalie Ben Bishop is having -- a plus-15.44 goals saved above average in 34 games -- is the reason the Stars are currently in a playoff sport.
But the bottom line is that they're in a playoff spot. After team president Jim Lites savaged stars Tyler Seguin and Jamie Benn in the media. After Montgomery himself proclaimed ""I haven't been able to change the culture of mediocrity"" in early January. After a 2-6-0 run in December had Montgomery admitting that he had lost his way as a coach.
He's kept this ship sailing and has gotten better in the job as the season has gone on -- witness recent lineup changes that sparked a five-game winning streak. Dallas is looking like a playoff team.
(For the record, his hot seat is at six because we're not sure what happens to GM Jim Nill if Dallas falls short of the playoffs this season. A new GM could mean a new coach.)

It's difficult to rate and rank Reirden. The Capitals aren't winning (.609 points percentage) as they were last season under Barry Trotz (.640). They're scoring more goals, but are also giving up more on average. Their special teams percentages are down from last season while their 5-on-5 metrics are up.
The defensive issues are, by far, the biggest concern for Capitals fans, although they do seem more systemic to the team's personnel changes over time than anything Reirden's done systems wise. The bigger issue might be that Reirden is learning as he goes as a first-time head coach, which includes how to handle slumps and how to manage egos, especially on a championship team, to maximize effort. It's not coming together quite yet.

This year was a mulligan for the Rangers and Quinn, who walked into what he knew was going to be a slow and steady rebuild. He's gotten more out of this Rangers team than many expected, as their 5-on-5 numbers are slightly better than they were last season under Alain Vigneault. But the most positive change between the former and current coaches is in the way Quinn handles young players. Look no further than Pavel Buchnevich. When Vigneault would scratch him, the moved seemed arbitrary; when Quinn does, it seems like part of a larger, concerted effort to cultivate his talent. Quinn has answered the hype from his BU-to-NHL leap and has proved effective in a no-stakes Year 1 for the Rangers.

Much was made about Colliton being 26 years younger than the man he replaced, Joel Quenneville. Heck, at 34 years old, he was one year younger than Duncan Keith, too. But that youthful optimism has served him well during this most unlikely of resurgences from the Blackhawks, as they climb the standings with a seven-game winning streak. Chicago is having fun and playing meaningful hockey, two things they seemed miles away from having when Quenneville's historic run with the franchise ended after 15 games. It felt rather impossible as late as January.
How much of that falls to Colliton? A good part of it. After getting a few weeks under his belt -- a ""training camp"" some argue he should have had in September had Chicago fired Quenneville in the summer -- the Blackhawks started finding some structure they lacked this season. Their possession numbers went from being in the toilet to being middle of the pack. He gave some players more responsibility, challenging them. And Stan Bowman gave him a few new toys to play with.
They're riding some heavy power-play and shooting percentage bumps through this winning streak, and will still likely fall short of the playoffs. But Colliton looks like he might be a keeper, and the fact that the Blackhawks are even in the playoff conversation now is stunning.

If the season ended today, the Hurricanes would have a better points percentage (.564) than they've had since 2008-09, aka the last time this franchise appeared in the postseason. So give Brind'Amour credit. For all the questions about his hiring as a total head-coaching novice, he's gotten something out of this squad, especially on offense. Their expected goals percentage (56.98) is way up from last season (53.12) while their possession numbers are higher than they were in Bill Peters' last year. That the Hurricanes are 21st in goals per 60 minutes at 5-on-5 (2.36) despite having the third-worst shooting percentage (6.81) is a heck of a trick.
Off the ice, Brind'Amour has cracked the whip but also allowed for rewards of the team's effort, like the Hurricanes' goofy victory celebrations. He's worked smartly with team consigliere Justin Williams to manage this roster with an ex-player's insight. But let's face it: In Tom Dundon's world, it's all about the results. And Brind'Amour's Hurricanes aren't yet a playoff team.

When Berube was hired on an interim basis, after the Mike Yeo 'hired your next coach to be on the bench with your current coach' experiment failed after parts of three seasons, his Blues promptly went 3-5-1. By Jan. 3, they were in last place in the NHL. Rumors that the entire roster, including Vladimir Tarasenko, was available circulated.
And now they're in a playoff seed, having won six in a row. What a league.
While the goaltending of rookie Jordan Binnington (1.72, .931) stabilized this team in his 13 games, this turnaround can't just be credited to the crease. Berube has gotten this offense going through a reinvigorated forecheck, line juggling and an activated defense. Under Yeo, the Blues averaged 2.95 goals per game. Since Jan. 3, they've scored at a 3.11 goals per game clip under Berube.
More importantly, he's managed to help the Blues locate their defensive responsibility again. Jake Allen saw a parade of odd-man rushes and choice scoring chances early in the season. In contrast, Binnington is seeing just 3.07 high-danger shots per game.
Despite all of this, we have to keep the temperature turned up on Berube's hot seat. He's an interim coach. Granted, if the Blues rally for a playoff spot, there's a compelling case to keep him. But with so many big-name coaches available (and the biggest, Quenneville, having some St. Louis ties), his status as the next coach of the Blues isn't on solid footing yet.

The Flames are a better possession team under Bill Peters. But that was sort of a given, wasn't it? His Hurricanes teams were always top of the pops in Corsi, but were always torpedoed by either a sputtering offense or bad goaltending. So the pleasant surprise here for Peters in Calgary is an offense that's the second-most potent in the NHL (3.67 goals per game) and goaltending that features 33 solid games of David Rittich being dragged down by 27 games of .889 goaltending by Mike Smith for a passable .901 team save percentage.
How much of the offensive spark can be credited to Peters? A bit, we think. The Flames are averaging over two more shots per 60 minutes at 5-on-5 (30.97) to go along with the upticks in possession metrics and a plus-9.02 in expected goals.
But there's a bunch more beyond the numbers here for Peters. The Flames talk about his attention to detail and preparation. ""What we do in a game, what other teams do in a game, faceoffs, any small detail ... We have it covered,"" forward Garnet Hathaway told the Calgary Sun. ""Every drill in practice, there are a few details that have to be hit. Otherwise, you're up in the stands so you see that when we don't get the details rights, we'll start the drill over. I think that has helped us stay accountable and I think it's helped us stay structured in our whole game. You can build off the small things. When you have those pretty strong foundations, I think it's easier to keep improving.""
He walked into the Calgary room and addressed their issues from last season head-on and has their attention on and off the bench. There's a lot that's gone right for Calgary this season (and GM Brad Treliving should be credited as well), but Peters' arrival isn't coincidental to it.

In hindsight, it was like a hockey rom-com. The Stanley Cup-winning coach, jilted by his team over money and a desire to trade in for a younger model. The hapless franchise, jilted by their franchise player and summarily written off by much of the hockey world. They find each other out of necessity, and wouldn't you know it, they made magic together.
But seriously: Trotz has helped tighten up the Islanders' defense significantly. They're averaging five fewer shots against per game over last season. Their goals-against per 60 minutes of 5-on-5 play is 1.8 vs. 2.54 last season. Much of this is their system, but the play of Robin Lehner and Thomas Greiss in goal -- thanks in no small part to goalie guru Mitch Korn's influence -- has been outstanding.
They're 10 points clear of the playoff bubble. Barring catastrophe, Trotz is going to do what no other hire will do in his first season at the new helm: Win the Jack Adams.
It's impossible to judge Murray as an NHL coach, given that this Lou Lamoriello cosplay is his first time behind the bench. We can, however, judge him as a general manager.
Is this an ideal roster for 2019? No. It's too plodding and punchless for the current incarnation of the NHL, which isn't helped by the second line being anchored by a cicada shell that used to house Ryan Kesler. But the Ducks were also coming off seven straight seasons of over .600 points percentage hockey, and the West playoff bubble is so mediocre, so this should be a team that's in a playoff spot right now.
That it isn't falls on two things. First, goalie John Gibson's back broke from carrying the team for three months, and his .900 save percentage and 3.26 GAA in January contributed to their 19 losses in 21 games run. Second, Gibson's collapse ultimately meant he could no longer be the air freshener covering up the stench of this team's play under Randy Carlyle. Even in their best moments this season, the Ducks were a house of cards built on terrible possession metrics and an expected goal differential at 5-on-5 of minus-30.07, the worst in the NHL.
Like we said, we can't judge Murray as head coach, but we can judge him as a general manager. And in our judgment, he waited far too long to fire a coach whose team was being propped up ""Weekend At Bernie's"" style by a goalie pushing for a Hart/Vezina sweep while the rest of the team withered. He did so because the coach was his friend, to the point where it took a 2-15-4 run and his team quitting on him to finally end his tenure. Look, they don't give ticket refunds if your team loses, but darn, if Ducks fans wouldn't have a class-action suit for dereliction of duty here ...
Anyway, good luck to Coach Murray in his multiweek evaluation process. And to the next guy he hires to take over the Ducks as well.

25954526,"Panarin issued a statement Friday that read, ""I have decided to hire Paul Theofanous as my agent. He is very experienced, and I'm confident he will serve my interests best going forward.""
The Russian winger held a rare English-language media session with reporters on Friday in Las Vegas, where the Jackets take on the Vegas Golden Knights on Saturday. He used that opportunity to explain why he has opted not to sign a new contract with Columbus before the Feb. 25 NHL trade deadline.
""It's one life, one chance for free agency, and I want to test free agency,"" he said, according to the Columbus Dispatch. ""[They] have a chance [to sign me], but we'll see what happens in the summer. I want to still [consider] this season and help the team win the Stanley Cup.""
Panarin, 27, has 20 goals and 40 assists for 60 points in 51 games this season. Since 2015, he's seventh in the NHL in points scored. Columbus acquired him from the Chicago Blackhawks in June 2017 with the hope that they could convince him to be a franchise building block. Instead, Panarin said he intends to test the market as an unrestricted free agent, prompting massive speculation that the Blue Jackets could move the coveted winger before the trade deadline.
The Boston Bruins, Nashville Predators and New York Islanders are among the potential suitors at the trade deadline. It was previously reported that Panarin wishes to play in a larger market than Columbus on his next contract. He purchased a condo in Miami last April, prompting speculation that the Florida Panthers could be on his radar.
As for the Blackhawks, Panarin was asked if he missed Chicago and didn't answer for several seconds, according to the Dispatch.
""I still enjoy it in Columbus right now. No thinking about Chicago,"" he said. ""It's a good team, and of course I miss friends. Friends like me. I know that. [Patrick] Kane likes me. It's a good team.""
Theofanous is Panarin's third agent in just about two years since he fired Tom Lynn for Milstein in 2017. Milstein issued a statement on Panarin's behalf on Jan. 28 after trade speculation heated up, saying, ""We have informed the team that we are willing to discuss Artemi's future after the season.""
About a week later, Milstein was no longer the agent to have those discussions.

25980064,"It's Jack Hughes and Kaapo Kakko leading the way, but how is the rest of the 2019 class shaping up? We rank the top 50 prospects for June's draft.
Months after the team gained international attention, it's working to start a Kenyan hockey federation and get more people playing the sport.
Hockey historian Mike Commito recently dug up a Sun-Sentinel story about a then-5-year-old Ariana Grande-Butera that caught the attention of hockey fans and the singer herself.
Her family had season tickets for the Panthers, seated behind the penalty boxes. One problem: That's right where pucks can fly into the stands. At a January 1998 game, a shot from Panthers defenseman Gord Murphy deflected over the glass and hit Grande on the right wrist. The Panthers gave her pieces of equipment as a consolation. She said thank you, next... Nine months later, she was hit with a puck a second time on her left wrist, on a bang-bang play during the Panthers' home opener against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Oct. 9, 1998.
According to the Sun Sentinel, Grande was the first fan to be hit by a puck at a Panthers game, which we imagine is an accomplishment on par with her winning ""Choice Selfie Taker"" at the 2016 Teen Choice Awards.
Grande kept breathin' and went to first aid, but only had a bruise. Perhaps after getting hit with a second puck she had no tears left to cry, as she hash-tagged her tweet about the story: ""Fine After Being Struck 2nd Time.""
As for the Zamboni ride, that was through a charity auction that her mother won with a bid of $200. The photo of Grande -- driving straight ahead, not side to side -- went viral this week, because it showed her with curly hair, rather than her trademark ponytail.

""If I'm honest ... this is still exactly what i look like without lashes and my pony ... anyone who knows me knows me knows ... like ... I'm twenty five. I was five here. The only difference now is that hand now says BBQ grill finger,"" said Grande on twitter, referencing her now-infamous Japanese kanji tattoo.
Grande would go on to sing the national anthem at Panthers games and was still rocking Florida hockey sweaters as late as 2013, so perhaps she'll attend another game, even if it's one last time.
As of 2019, the Panthers have yet to capture the Stanley Cup, while Grande currently has the No. 1 song in the country with ""7 Rings.""

25940324,"Koivu, 35, is scheduled to undergo surgery Friday. He suffered the injury after colliding with Buffalo Sabres forward Tage Thompson in the first period of Tuesday's 5-4 shootout loss and did not return.
The Finnish center is sixth on the team with 29 points this season and is averaging 18:18 of ice time per game, third among forwards. He leads the team with a 54.6 face-off percentage.
It's a jumbled mess of teams fighting for the two slots. We debate which clubs will ultimately emerge.
We grade each team in six areas, identify a class president and student in danger of failing, and issue an overall mark based on preseason expectations.
Koivu, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2001 NHL draft, ranks first in franchise history in games played (973), points (688), assists, (487) as well as power play points, short-handed points and multipoint games.
He scored his 200th career NHL goal on Jan. 21 to become the second player in team history to reach the milestone.
In a corresponding move, the Wild recalled 22-year-old Joel Eriksson Ek from its AHL affiliate. Eriksson Ek has played 36 games with Minnesota this season.
Koivu has one year remaining on his contract with a $5.5 million cap hit.
The Wild have another significant injury they're handling: Defenseman Matt Dumba is out until at least April after shoulder surgery.
Minnesota, which has made the playoffs in six consecutive seasons, has 57 points in 53 games this season and is holding on to the top wild-card spot in the West. The Wild are three points behind Dallas for the third spot in the Central Division.

25954869,"""There was no escaping the pressure of 1940,"" Messier said of the last year the Rangers had won the Cup. ""Coming here and understanding what the Original Six franchise was and this history, there was no escaping it. The pressure was real, from the fans, the organization.""
Messier accomplished the task in 1994, as the Rangers ended their 54-year title drought by outlasting the Vancouver Canucks in seven games in the Stanley Cup Final. Honored with a parade in the Canyon of Heroes in lower Manhattan that June, the players from that team were back at Madison Square Garden on Friday to celebrate the 25-year anniversary.
""When you are in New York, not a day goes by that you don't run into someone that you get reminded, get smiles,"" Adam Graves said before the ceremony that preceded the Rangers' 3-0 loss to Carolina. ""Back then, you never thought you'd be impacting the way we have been. It is very special.""
From general manager Neil Smith and coach Mike Keenan to stars Messier, Brian Leetch, Mike Richter, Craig MacTavish and Stephane Matteau, each were introduced to a rousing ovation. The only absences from the group were Alexander Karpovtsev, who was killed along with most of the KHL Lokomotiv team in a plane crash in 2011, and Brian Noonan, who was said to have a prior commitment.
The team played a video highlighting the championship season.

Messier said he has been approached by countless people since who thanked him and claimed to have witnessed the Game 7 win in New York.
""I didn't realize Madison Square Garden holds 2 million people,"" he said, ""because I've talked to 2 million people over 25 years that were here that night. That's been interesting. It never gets old ... never get tired of speaking with people on the street or in the subway or trains or taxi drivers that recognize the guys or myself and thank us for the Cup.""
Messier is also remembered for his famous declaration before Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals against New Jersey in which, with the Rangers trailing 3-2 in the series, he guaranteed that the team would win Game 6.
Messier said he was simply trying to let his teammates know he believed in the team.
""I really felt we could go into New Jersey and win, and I wanted the guys to know it,"" he said. ""The papers the next day were what they were. It wasn't going to motivate New Jersey any more.""
Leetch said the team chuckled when they saw Messier's Game 6 guarantee in the papers, and it didn't change anything about their preparation for that game.
""Just was kind of a light-hearted thing to remember that we're in New York -- everything gets magnified,"" Leetch said. ""One comment gets turned into a guarantee. It was something for a little bit that we had a laugh about.""
Messier backed up his words with a hat trick in the third period to rally the Rangers to a 4-2 win.
""He's always done things his whole career,"" Leetch said. ""He's been a part of a lot of big moments and rises to occasions in big games, but the fact he did that here in New York when it was on the front and back pages, we still shake our heads at it that he was the guy to do it in that game.""
The Rangers won Game 7 on Matteau's goal in double-overtime.
They lost the opening game in the championship series against the Canucks despite having a big advantage on shots, then won three straight to get to the cusp of ending their long drought before being forced to the deciding game.
""I remember saying we should have won this series four straight,"" Messier said. ""Coming back and losing Game 5 and 6, and then we're back in another Game 7.""
Then Messier came through again, giving the Rangers a two-goal lead that stood as the winner to deliver the franchise and the city the long-awaited title he had been brought in to get.
""When Mark came across the ice to celebrate the Stanley Cup victory and handed it to me, and I looked it over, the first thing that came to my mind is I can't believe how difficult this trophy is to win,"" said Keenan, who said he is doing well after his treatment for prostate cancer last year. ""As now time passes, 25 years later, that endorsement of how difficult it is stands even more in my mind.""
Difficult indeed, as the championship in 1994 remains the Rangers' only title in the past 79 years.

25980433,"Pettersson's teammates in the Swedish Hockey League began calling him ""The Alien"" for his ethereal playmaking ability, but it's also appropriate for the way the 20-year-old slithers his 176-pound body across the ice, fending off (and evading) men with 40-plus pounds on him.
Months after the team gained international attention, it's working to start a Kenyan hockey federation and get more people playing the sport.
It's Jack Hughes and Kaapo Kakko leading the way, but how is the rest the 2019 class shaping up? We rank the top 50 prospects for June's draft.
""It's been with me all my life,"" Pettersson said at NHL All-Star weekend at the end of January. ""Now I'm pretty -- kind of -- tall, but I'm still skinny. When I grew up, I was short and skinny. I was always hearing, 'He's too small to play. He won't be able to play good, blah, blah, blah.'""
This season, the average NHL player's weight dipped under 200 pounds for the first time in 20 years (the average opening-night roster featured players at 199.3). The league's newfound emphasis on speed and skill, while putting less of a premium on being brute, also plays in Pettersson's favor. And yet, during Pettersson's draft year, his slight frame concerned some scouts, and was the largest reason he fell to No. 5 overall in 2017.
Yet, with 51 points in 46 games, he's on pace to have the best rookie season since Alex Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby's sizzling co-debut in 2005-06. And the largest reason Pettersson is thriving so far might not be in spite of his size, but perhaps because of it. Being thin heightened Pettersson's spacial awareness and forced him to embrace a crafty spirit.
""He [isn't] scared to dangle,"" teammate Nikolay Goldobin says. ""He [isn't] scared of it. He isn't scared of turning over the puck. And then he makes plays that maybe you don't expect.""
""He can shimmy-shake anyone,"" says linemate, Brock Boeser. ""He gets the puck next to the blue line on the power play. Any other player would have dumped it in. He shimmy-shakes the guy. Some plays he makes, I just don't know how someone can do that.""
Pettersson is deliberate about everything he does, from learning not only how to master his father's old unicycle but also juggle while riding it, to executing bank passes off the boards reminiscent of plays from the Sedin twins' playbook. And of course, he works as hard as anybody.
Before his first season with Vaxjo (SHL) in 2017-18, Pettersson wasn't pleased with where his shot was. He identified 12 different motor movements that composed his shot, then spent 15 minutes after practice every day to work on each component individually until he was satisfied. The result? As a teenager playing among men, Pettersson tallied 24 goals and 56 points in 44 games, winning the league scoring title, SHL Rookie of the Year and both the regular-season and playoff MVP. It was the most points ever for a junior player in the SHL, breaking a mark set 40 years ago by Kent Nilsson -- a player Wayne Gretzky would later call ""the most skilled hockey player I ever saw in my entire career.""
And so maybe it's no surprise that Gretzky is also in awe of Pettersson. In fact, the Great One reserved the highest praise for the Canucks rookie on an appearance with Sportsnet 650. Gretzky said Pettersson was ""exactly what the people in Vancouver needed to sort of move on from the Sedin era.""
And even better: ""From my point of view, he's got a lot of my similarities.""
The wild-card picture in the Western Conference is a jumbled mess. The fact that the Canucks are still in the mix (and, as of this writing, two points out) cannot be understated. In what was supposed to be a rebuilding phase, depth is still troubling, but Vancouver has the right building blocks. Center Bo Horvat is only 23 and trending for his best statistical season. Brock Boeser, 21, is a pure sniper (he led the team in scoring last season as a rookie, despite playing just 62 games), and 23-year-old goalie Thatcher Demko has been long lauded as an uber prospect. Then there's the elite puck-moving defenseman Quinn Hughes, 19, still matriculating at Michigan, but shining at international tournaments.

However, it was Pettersson's arrival that transformed the complexion of the franchise, akin to what Ovechkin did for Washington 13 years ago. The Canucks are not shy of announcing Pettersson as their best player. Just ask Boeser, who was the toast of the city in his rookie season. Boeser-mania included fans retailing shirts with photo collages of his face. By spring, after he became the first rookie ever to win All-Star MVP, Boeser was filming skits with singer Michael Buble.
""The hype around Elias is crazier -- it's way crazier,"" Boeser says. ""What he's done for the fans and this city already is tremendous. He's coming into this league and getting 10 goals in his first 10 games? That's something no one really does. He's a special player.""
The Canucks, of course, knew that. Undaunted by Pettersson's size, they gave him the first max rookie contract for a No. 5 pick. That means he can earn up to $2.85 million in bonuses. He unlocked two $212,500 bonuses on the same day in early January when he was named the Canucks' All-Star representative, then subsequently scored his 20th goal. He'll get another $212,500 when he hits 35 assists (he's already at 26) and $212,500 when he gets to 60 points (he's at 51).
A sensational prospect in a hungry Canadian market is the recipe for extra scrutiny, and Pettersson's relationship with the media didn't get off to the best start. He is a perfectionist and has found a way to excel in every area of his hockey life. He hasn't, however, mastered English yet, and some of his interviews can appear awkward. He gained a reputation as being abrupt. And if it's perceived that he doesn't like a particular question from a journalist, well, that's how The Pettersson Death Stare became a meme.
""Sometimes I think when reporters ask him stuff, he doesn't know what they're asking,"" Boeser says. ""So that's when he gives them that look -- it's because he has no idea what they want. If I had Swedish reporters asking me s---, I'd probably look at them too.""
Pettersson lives alone in Vancouver, but he spends a good amount of time hanging out with Boeser and Goldobin, a Russian-born winger. Goldobin has been in North America for four seasons. Though he's increasingly more comfortable with his English, he says non-native speakers struggle with other conversational norms Canadians or Americans might take for granted. ""You know [Washington Capitals center Evgeny] Kuznetsov?"" Goldobin says. ""He's so funny with the media, I wish I could show that personality ... I'm not there yet. When I talk to you, I don't really think I can show that off.""
And so, yes, there are times that Pettersson has appeared surly. After he scored a goal and tallied four assists against St. Louis on Dec. 6, a reporter commented: ""It's not easy to put up five-point nights.""
Pettersson's response: ""No."" And then a long pause. After Pettersson scored a hat trick against the Ottawa Senators on Jan. 2, some Ottawa reporters appeared incredulous when Pettersson explained he once dreamed of playing in Vancouver as a child. ""Yeah,"" Pettersson said. ""Google it.""
Then there was media day in San Jose, where Pettersson, one of 11 All-Stars age 22 or under, was asked if he felt like he was part of the star player community yet. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""I don't really want to go into that conversation. I don't really have a good answer for that."" (Pettersson actually summed up his take on All-Star media day in his blog for the Canucks website: ""There was quite a bit of media at the event, but the questions were pretty much the same: Am I surprised at how well the season is going, am I feeling more comfortable in the NHL and who am I most excited to meet this weekend. The answers are yes, yes and the Swedish players! Always nice to meet my fellow countrymen."")

In a broad sense, Pettersson has actually been quite accommodating for the media. He already has appeared in two of Canada's most high profile TV shows: An ""After Hours"" segment with Scott Oake and a one-on-one produced session with Nick Kypreos on Sportsnet, a day after Pettersson awkwardly collided with Montreal's Jesperi Kotkaniemi. Pettersson, at the time of the interview, was still awaiting MRI results to determine the severity of the injury. (He would miss five games with a right knee sprain.)
Reports from Vancouver media suggest Pettersson has improved in scrums over the past month or so. His English has also improved since he first arrived in North America. ""At development camp, he didn't know any English,"" Boeser says. ""He wasn't the nicest, at least I felt like that because he looked at you like he had no idea what he was saying. He's come a long way since then.""
Pettersson -- or, around the team, Petey -- is quite popular in the locker room now. ""At first he's kind of shy with people he doesn't know, but once you get to know him, he opens up but he's a humble kid,"" Boeser says. ""I feel like I see some similarities with myself. We're roommates on the road and we've been best buddies ever since.""
Pettersson is very close to his older brother, Emil, a 2013 sixth-round draft pick of the Nashville Predators who was traded to the Arizona Coyotes organization last week. The Pettersson brothers grew up in Ange, a small town in the center of Sweden with a population under 3,000. The brothers return over the summer and train together, except for the two weeks they'll return to their old Swedish club, where they believe the strength coach is the best in the world.
Perhaps that coach holds the blueprint for how a 176-pounder can thrive in the modern NHL. More likely, it's a combination of Pettersson's industrious spirit and diligence. ""As a young player coming in, he has a good work ethic and that's good to see,"" Vancouver coach Travis Green says. ""A lot of young guys, you need to push them in that area, and he hasn't been one of them.""

25924144,"The Capitals signed backup Pheonix Copley to a $3.3 million, three-year extension Monday that keeps him under contract through the 2021-22 season at a salary-cap hit of $1.1 million. It's a move that gives the defending Stanley Cup champions some stability in goal but raises questions about their plans.
Starter Braden Holtby is signed only through the end of next season, and Washington has top prospect Ilya Samsonov and 2014 second-round pick Vitek Vanecek in the system. With Copley in the fold, the decision is looming between committing long-term to Holtby and turning the net over to Samsonov.
""It'll work itself out, I think,'' general manager Brian MacLellan said. ""We'll see how Samsonov comes and what our situation is cap-wise and the signings we determine to make.''
Holtby won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goaltender in 2016 and rebounded from a rough stretch last season to backstop Washington to the first title in franchise history. But he stands to get a significant raise from $6.1 million per year and will be 31 when his next contract begins.
Given that the Capitals have already committed big dollars and term to center Evgeny Kuznetsov, wingers Tom Wilson and T.J. Oshie and defensemen John Carlson and Dmitry Orlov and also have center Nicklas Backstrom's contract up after next season, there is no guarantee the room is there for Holtby.
""It's human nature to think about it,'' Holtby said. ""But outside of maybes, you have no idea. It's a long ways away. A goaltender's life can change pretty quickly, so you've got to stay in the moment and just play.''
Samsonov was the 22nd pick in 2015 and considered one of the best goalie prospects in hockey. He got off to a rough start in his first season in North America with Hershey of the American Hockey League, but the 21-year-old Russian has played much better since. With Vanecek also in the mix, it could pave the way for a trade before the Feb. 25 deadline.
""I like Vitek, too. Samsonov is coming,'' MacLellan said. ""Holtby is Holtby. He's an All-Star goalie. And Copley is finding his way as a good No. 2, so I think it's important for us to have depth as an organization, protect yourself on injuries.''
Copley has exceeded expectations in his first season as a full-time NHL backup, going 10-5-3 with a 2.98 goals-against average and .903 save percentage. The 27-year-old native from North Pole, Alaska, came into the year with a 4.32 GAA and .829 save percentage in two games with the St. Louis Blues.
The Capitals turned to Copley almost by default after trading Philipp Grubauer to Colorado. Coach Todd Reirden said Copley has earned extra starts.
""There are four different occasions that I can tell you about that we could've used Braden in that situation and we chose to use Pheonix and he produced right after it,'' Reirden said. ""That's how you earn the coach's trust and the players' trust, and the players battle for him hard because they know the effort he puts in every day in practice.''
Teammates saluted Copley before practice when Reirden told them about the extension, which came after he made adjustments with goaltending coach Scott Murray since training camp.
""A lot of it's adjusting to the speed, and the little changes from league to league,'' Copley said. ""My plan is just to continue to get better every day, continue working with Scotty and just make sure my game is growing continually.''

We're not trying to do a ""please like my sport"" here, although admittedly that's an inevitability for an American hockey fan in these types of discussions. We're simply saying that for the greatest dynasties in NHL history, surviving the grueling gauntlet of any era to win multiple championships is worthy of immortality. Or at least a trip to Disney World.
Here's our ranking of the 10 greatest dynasties in NHL history. A few things to keep in mind about this countdown:
We take the context of different eras into account, including the number of teams in the league, the playoff format and other aspects.
Hence, there is a ""degree of difficulty"" curve for teams playing in the modern era vs. the Original Six era. Especially for teams that, for example, might have had to deal with increased player movement and the salary cap.
Our definitions of ""dynasties"" and their length might not always sync up with yours, but just go with it.
Thanks to the ESPN NHL editorial staff, Hockey Hall of Fame writer Michael Farber and others for their input. Now, who has the greatest NHL dynasty?
This Leafs team gets a degree of difficulty nod for winning three straight Stanley Cups in 70-game seasons, although the NHL was still made up of just six teams at that time. They went 24-12 in that three-year stretch in the postseason. Overall, they won four Stanley Cups in six seasons during a time when the Montreal Canadiens and Chicago Blackhawks were stacked.
This was not a dominant regular-season team: They finished first in the regular season only once, and finished with a points percentage above .600 just once (in 1962). And they lost twice in the semifinals between their third and fourth Cup wins. But these teams had 10 or more Hall of Fame players, including Frank Mahovlich, Red Kelly and Dave Keon. Oh, and Dick Duff.
At first glance, one might want to dip back to their 1942 Cup to really broaden this dynasty, but Ted ""Teeder"" Kennedy wasn't on that team. He was there for all five Stanley Cups of this seven-season run, so we'll make him our point of demarcation. (Keep in mind that the first Cup of this run occurred in a 50-game season, the next three in 60-game seasons and the final one in a 70-game season.)
That's five Stanley Cup Final appearances and five Stanley Cups during the Original Six era, which is impressive. Less impressive: That the Leafs only finished first in the regular season once in that run -- in 1947-48, with a team featuring five Hall of Famers, including the soon-retired Syl Apps -- and missed the four-team playoff completely in 1945-46. Either of these Leafs teams could have finished ninth or 10th, as they represent the most successful stretches in franchise history. For whatever that's worth.
Later on in this ranking, you'll see why this 1960s run for the Canadiens is the lesser of their dynasties. They had three first-place finishes in this five-season ride, making the Final all five times and winning four Cups. It's worth noting that this Canadiens group bridged an era for the NHL: Their first two Cups were won in 70-game, two-playoff-round Original Six seasons while their other two were won in seasons of 74 and 76 games and three-round playoffs thanks to the league's 1967 expansion to 10 teams.
Hence, their Cup wins in 1968 and 1969 were against the fledgling St. Louis Blues, against whom they went 8-0, outscoring them 23-10. So these playoffs had a bit of that ""1980 U.S. Olympic team beats the Russians but still has to get past Finland"" vibe after getting through the Original Six to face an expansion team.
The nine-season stretch is the dawn of the Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay Era. The Wings lost in the Cup Final in consecutive 60-game seasons (1947-48 and 1948-49) before capturing their first title since 1943. They'd win three more Cups and make the final a total of seven times in this dynastic run. In the regular season, they finished in first place seven consecutive seasons.
The 1952 Cup championship team was one of the most dominant of that era: first in goals, first in goals against, 44-14-12 and a perfect 8-0 in the playoffs. That team featured seven future Hall of Famers, including Howe, who led the NHL in points from 1950 to '54. Please also note that the 1951-52 Red Wings championship team inspired Pete and Jerry Cusimano, who owned a seafood spot in Detroit's Eastern Market, to first hurl an octopus on the ice in honor of the eight wins it took to capture the Cup.
Let me explain.

In the history of the NHL, it has never been harder to establish a dynasty. There were 30 teams when the Blackhawks had this six-season run. There was a salary cap that necessitated a massive changeover in the roster after their first championship. There was free agency. There were different playoff formats. There was the overall level of talent in competition -- including exceptional leaps in quality of coaching and goaltending over the past two decades -- that players who competed on many of these other dynastic teams said was at an apex for the NHL.
This Blackhawks team finished first in its division twice during this run, although there was only one season (2010-11) in which the Hawks had a points percentage of less than .600. They had two straight first-round playoff losses in between their first and second Cups, which doesn't help them. Nor does the fact that the Pittsburgh Penguins won three Stanley Cups around this time as well, albeit in a span of nine years.
But in the salary cap era, I fall on the side of the debate that considers this run a dynasty. The core of the team -- Patrick Kane, Jonathan Toews, Marian Hossa, Duncan Keith, the effective years of Brent Seabrook, Niklas Hjalmarsson and Joel Quenneville -- was its backbone. GM Stan Bowman filled in around the edges. If Sidney Crosby's Penguins capture another Stanley Cup in the next three seasons, they might eclipse this Blackhawks run. But in the cap era, no one has put together six seasons like the Blackhawks did. This degree of difficulty puts them ahead of some Original Six champions.
The length of this modern dynasty can be tabulated in two ways. You can go with those three Stanley Cups in six years from 1996 to 2002, or you can extend it back to 1995, when the Red Wings lost in the Stanley Cup Final to the New Jersey Devils. The latter gives them three Stanley Cups, four conference titles, five first-place finishes and six of eight seasons with a points percentage of over .600. So we'll go with that.
From their first Cup Final appearance to their 2002 Cup, the Wings saw the NHL expand from 26 to 30 teams. Unlike the Blackhawks, the Red Wings didn't have to deal with the salary cap, which obviously had its advantages in 2002 when Detroit had no less than nine Hall of Famers on its roster, all over the age of 30. But the Blackhawks also didn't have to deal with a nemesis like the Colorado Avalanche blocking their path to the Cup Final in their conference: Detroit lost to the Avs in the playoffs three times during this eight-year stretch.
But when they made the final round, the Wings made it count: In the three years they won the Cup, Detroit went a combined 12-1 in the Final. As modern dynasties go, their run from the mid-1990s into the new millennium set the bar for dynasty-seeking franchises.
(For what it's worth, the bloody rivalry worked both ways: The Avalanche won two Stanley Cups in 1996 and 2001, but couldn't find their way through Detroit in two of their four trips to the conference final. Oh, what could have been, Joe Sakic & Co.)
It might be a reach to include that 1953 Stanley Cup, but with Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard, Jacques Plante, Doug Harvey and Bernie Geoffrion as the through line to their five straight Cup wins, we'll allow it.
(Plante, by the way, would ""invent"" the goalie mask during this run, wearing one in a game in 1959 to spark a league-wide trend.)
This was the first team in NHL history to win five straight Stanley Cups, and the Canadiens did it convincingly: Going 40-9 (!) in the playoffs, including two series sweeps in 1960 for their final championship. They had four first-place finishes in these 70-game seasons, finishing with a points percentage above .600 five times in eight seasons. (They lost in the Final in the two seasons before their 1953 win.) Again, this was a six-team league with a two-round playoff, but in that pre-expansion era, no one dominated like the Canadiens in this stretch. It was, however, a pre-expansion era.
The 1980s produced two dynasties, and ranking them comes down to quality vs. quantity. We valued the former over the latter, so here are the Oilers: Five Stanley Cups, six conference titles and six first-place finishes during this ridiculous run. Wayne Gretzky was there for first four Cups; the fact that they collected a fifth after The Trade remains one of the most remarkable feats in NHL history, given the context. Imagine the post-Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls winning the NBA title with only Scottie Pippen and Toni Kukoc.
This was a dynasty built on considerable star power -- Gretzky, Mark Messier, Jari Kurri, Paul Coffey, Grant Fuhr -- built by one of the most successful coaches/executives in hockey history in Glen Sather. They were on another planet offensively, leading the NHL in goals in five consecutive seasons. Would they be higher on this list without that semifinal stumble to the Calgary Flames in 1986 and that semifinal defeat at Gretzky's hands in 1989? Without question. As it stands, five Cups in a seven-year span is a remarkable achievement in a league with four playoff rounds and 21 teams. But four in a row is just a little more remarkable ...
Before 1980, the Islanders hadn't advanced past the semifinals since entering the league in 1972. Then they won four Stanley Cups in a row, an achievement that hasn't come close to being matched over the next four decades. They added a fifth conference title in five seasons in 1984, losing to the Edmonton Oilers in the Stanley Cup Final to formally pass the torch. Before that, they were 20-4 in the Final, defeating Gretzky's Oilers once.
Again, it's a quantity (Oilers) vs. quality (Islanders) debate for the peak run of the decade. One reason New York gets the nod: 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984, which remains unmatched not only in NHL history but in sports history. Bryan Trottier, Mike Bossy, Denis Potvin, Billy Smith, Al Arbour, Bill Torrey ... it may not have been the longest run, but it was the best dynasty in the 1980s to not feature Joan Collins.
A decade of dominance, starting with Ken Dryden's rookie run to the Conn Smythe and ending with the last of Scotty Bowman's eight years as head coach. In nine seasons, they won six Stanley Cups and six conference titles. They had seven first-place finishes and finished with better than a .600 points percentage all nine seasons. That included the best season for any team in the modern NHL: 1976-77, when Montreal went 60-8-12, good for an NHL-record 132 points and a .825 points percentage. In three straight championship seasons (1975-76 to 1977-78), the Habs went a ridiculous 177-29-34 in the regular season.

Their final Stanley Cup team featured 10 Hall of Famers, including Dryden, Guy Lafleur, Larry Robinson, Jacques Lemaire and Rod Langway. Their first Stanley Cup team of the run featured 11, including Frank Mahovlich and Henri Richard. They dominated in ways few teams had, beating you with offense or defense. They sold coffee makers. They were rock stars. Well, at least Lafleur was.
The Canadiens have had multiple dynasties. They even won five Cups in a row during one of them. But this spectacular roll in a post-expansion NHL, and especially those four Cups in a row, make this nine-year Montreal Canadiens run the NHL's greatest dynasty; and, probably, the greatest in North American sports history.
Heck, it took Tom Brady 18 years before getting a ring on his other hand ...

25908456,"The Sabres announced the move Saturday, while a person familiar with the Maple Leafs' decision told The Associated Press about Marincin.
Elie was placed on waivers for demotion to the minors a day after playing a team-low nine shifts in a 7-3 loss to Chicago. He played his second consecutive game after being a healthy scratch in Buffalo's previous seven.
Elie has one assist in 16 games since being waived by Dallas and claimed by the Sabres on Oct. 2.
Marincin becomes the odd man out after Toronto acquired defenseman Jake Muzzin in a trade with Los Angeles on Monday. The sixth-year player has two assists in 10 games this season and will be assigned to the minors should he go unclaimed.

Toronto still has to come to terms with forward Mitch Marner, who is in the final year of his rookie contract and leads the team with 63 points in 52 games.
Matthews has 23 goals and 23 assists in just 38 games this season. He was the first overall pick of the 2016 draft and has been an All-Star in each of his three seasons. He had 40 goals as a rookie and 34 last season when injuries limited him to 62 games.
Matthews and the Maple Leafs agreed to a five-year, $58.17 million deal. Here's a look at the teams and players affected.
Scoring leader Nikita Kucherov of the Lightning has charged to the top of the Hart Trophy ranks. Who's ahead for all the major awards?
For Matthews, 93 percent of the new deal will be paid in signing bonus money, which is lockout, rollback and buyout protected. That includes $40.1 million in signing bonuses in the first three years of the deal.
At the NHL All-Star Game, Matthews said he wasn't concerned about the deal getting done.
""It's something that's in the back of your mind. When it gets done, it gets done. I'm not too worried about it. When my agent calls me and says we're ready to sign, then I'll sign,"" he said.
As a percentage of the salary cap, Matthews' contract is a blockbuster. The average annual value of the deal would be 14.6 percent of the current cap of $79.5 million. That's higher than the second contracts for Edmonton Oilers center Leon Draisaitl (11.3 percent) and Buffalo Sabres center Jack Eichel (13.3 percent) when they were signed. The average annual value of McDavid's second contract with the Oilers was 16.6 percent of the cap.
The key difference between Matthews' deal and the deals for those players, of course, is term. Rather than commit to an eight-year max contract, the Leafs decided to sign him to a deal that brings him right to unrestricted free agency, in an effort to create some added financial flexibility for a team that already is committed annually to Tavares through 2025 and has to sign the 21-year-old Marner to his second contract.

Delia began last season in the ECHL before being promoted to Rockford of the American Hockey League. He made his NHL debut last March, going 1-1 in two starts.

25966319,"Carlyle, 62, was in his second stint with the Ducks and is the winningest coach in team history. He led the team to a Stanley Cup in 2006-07, his second season with the team. He was fired after a slow start to the 2011-12 season and was hired by the Maple Leafs. Toronto let him go in 2015.
""We thank Randy for everything he has done for the organization,"" Murray said in a statement. ""Leading the team to a Stanley Cup and three conference final appearances, he has accomplished so much in Anaheim. Difficult decisions need to be made when times are tough, and our play has clearly been unacceptable. We have a tradition of success in Anaheim, and we need to get back to that.""
Sources say Murray was hesitant to fire Carlyle earlier because he does not believe in midseason coaching changes. Dallas Eakins, the coach of the Ducks' AHL affiliate, the San Diego Gulls, would have been in consideration for the interim job, but the Gulls are having a strong season (currently third in the AHL's Pacific Division), and Murray was wary of impeding development there. Eakins is the front-runner for the full-time job in 2019-20.
The Ducks have spiraled the past two months. By mid-December, they had 19 wins in their first 35 games, boasting the ninth-best record in the league and top record in the Pacific Division. Since then, Anaheim has gone 2-15-4, including a 12-game losing streak, which is the worst record in the league. Anaheim entered Sunday's action in last place in the Pacific Division. Before Carlyle's dismissal, the Ducks had lost seven straight games, and in them, they were outscored 37-8.
""What has happened here lately and how we have played, it was time for change,"" Murray said during a conference call. ""Some people thought I waited far too long, but this team has a history of coming on and charging late. I realized it wasn't going to happen a few days ago.""
Rickard Rakell, Cam Fowler, Ryan Miller and Patrick Eaves have all missed time to injury this season. Forward Ondrej Kase is out for the remainder of the season after undergoing surgery for a torn labrum. Corey Perry underwent surgery in training camp for an MCL injury and made his season debut on Feb. 3.
Anaheim faces difficult personnel decisions as it gears up for a retool. The ""big three"" of Perry, Ryan Getzlaf and Ryan Kesler are all over the age of 33 and have each battled significant injuries the past two seasons. Perry and Getzlaf have cap hits above $8 million and are under contract through 2020-21. Kesler, with a $6.875 million cap hit, is under contract through 2021-22. All three players have no-movement clauses.
Murray has begun trying to reshape the roster, with eight trades since Dec. 3.
""It's a combination of everything, but what bothered me the most was the lack of emotion,"" Murray said. ""We've always pushed back. We never accept, and they were accepting, and that is unacceptable. We have to change that.""
The Ducks qualified for the playoffs each of the past six seasons. Only the Pittsburgh Penguins have a longer streak. On Dec. 8, Murray signed a two-year contract extension to take him through the 2021-22 season.
""Bob's obviously going to need to implement his vision of what he envisions our team doing,'' Getzlaf said following Sunday's practice. ""We had a good practice, lots of talking and lots of trying to understand exactly what's going on and what he wants to see out of us.""
Fowler said he hopes the change can shake the Ducks into making a late run.
""Sometimes all you need is a fresh start to get some good mojo,'' he said. ""We felt like we were just kind of stuck in neutral, and as hard as we were trying to work to get things going better, we just couldn't find a way to do it.''
Murray, 64, played in 1,008 NHL games in 15 seasons (1975-1990) for the Chicago Blackhawks. After retiring, he began working in the Blackhawks' front office and later became the team's GM from 1997 to '99. He has never coached in the NHL.

It's slim pickings for youngsters on David Poile's roster, but the nod goes to No. 2 goaltender Juuse Saros (.922 save percentage, 2.43 goals-against average during the past three seasons as Pekka Rinne's primary backup).
Previous ranking: 10
David Pastrnak leads the league with 15 power-play goals, and is in the top 10 in scoring overall. Pasta is the real deal, and a real steal at No. 25 of the 2014 draft. Only one player selected ahead of Pastrnak (No. 3 pick Leon Draisaitl) has been more productive.
Previous ranking: 11
Next season, Jesperi Kotkaniemi -- a mild surprise No. 3 pick in the draft, and a definite surprise to make the regular roster at age 18 -- is probably most impactful. For now, it's Max Domi, leading the team with 47 points. (Domi is 23 only until March 2 though).
Previous ranking: 9
The Penguins opened the season with the second-highest average age in the league (28.7). That's how a midseason trade acquisition, 22-year-old defenseman Marcus Pettersson, has ended up as their most impactful youngster.
Previous ranking: 8
It's a toss-up between the only two regular 23-and-unders on the roster: winger Alex Tuch (who leads the team with 40 points) and defenseman Shea Theodore, perhaps the team's most well-rounded blueliner.

Following the Stanley Cup run, Jakub Vrana has found momentum. The second-line winger has upped his totals in goals per game (0.30, up from 0.18) and points per game (0.58, up from 0.37) as he quickly has become a fan favorite thanks to his bubbly personality.
Previous ranking: 12
Pierre-Luc Dubois has 48 points through 52 games, matching his 82-game total from last season. The Blue Jackets always believed in Dubois, but fans wanted more sooner. It didn't help fans' patience when the two guys drafted ahead of him were Auston Matthews and Patrik Laine, but Dubois is emerging as a building block.
Previous ranking: 15
The team's lone All-Star was 19-year-old defenseman Miro Heiskanen, who has been a delight through the first half. He has seamlessly carried a big workload (23:08 average ice time), but now must stave off the infamous rookie wall.
Previous ranking: 14
The oldest team in the league, the Wild don't have many regular candidates to choose from. Jordan Greenway wins by default of playing the most games (52) and having the highest upside, though the winger has only nine goals and eight assists this season.
Previous ranking: 17
As the Sabres grind down the stretch looking to break a seven-year playoff drought, everything will run through the captain, Jack Eichel. He's the heartbeat of this team, and on pace for 94 points, which would smash his previous best of 64.

Previous ranking: 18
With an impressive 64.06 goals for percentage (sixth among all league centers who have played at least 600 minutes) Sebastian Aho is sparkling on the Canes' top line. The team now has a legitimate star, which should be reflected in his next contract.
Previous ranking: 16
It feels like a shame bypassing Mikko Rantanen, considering he's fifth in the league with 74 points in 52 games. But right behind him is linemate Nathan MacKinnon (72 points), the reigning runner-up for league MVP who doesn't turn 24 until September.
Previous ranking: 20
As the Blues improbably surge back into the playoff picture, let's give kudos to blueliner Vince Dunn, who is following up on his solid freshman campaign with more offensive production and more confidence.
Previous ranking: 19
The rookie taking the league by storm has transformed this franchise from forgettable in the rebuilding phase to relevant and on the playoff bubble. The Canucks have a plus-33 goal differential when 19-year-old Elias Pettersson is on the ice ... and a minus-45 when he's off.
Previous ranking: 25
The Flyers have reeled off a season-high eight-game win streak, thanks in large part to Carter Hart. The 20-year-old looks like the end to the goalie carousel; in 16 starts, he has 10 wins, a .925 save percentage and 2.48 GAA.
Previous ranking: 21
The Coyotes are the fourth-lowest scoring team in the league, which explains how their leading scorer has only 11 goals and 37 points. That's Clayton Keller, who will be the face of this franchise for years to come.
Previous ranking: 24
This season has been all about transition, though the youngest players are still struggling to find their way. Though he has slipped lately, the nod goes to 23-year-old Neal Pionk who -- for the most of the season -- had been the team's No. 1 defenseman and power-play quarterback.
The Patriots' Super Bowl win solidifies their spot among the top dynasties in any sport. Who are the NHL's best? Here are the top 10.
The Penguins landed two useful forwards and moved Derick Brassard off the books. Here's how both GMs did in the swap.
Matthews and the Maple Leafs agreed to a five-year, $58.17 million deal. Here's a look at the teams and players affected.
Previous ranking: 26
The Panthers are staying afloat in the playoff race, barely, but if they make the cut, they have Aleksander Barkov to thank. He leads the team in points and has long been lauded for his defensive play. Has the Finn finally shed the label of most underrated player in the league?
Previous ranking: 28
Alex DeBrincat often gets overshadowed by the brand-name stars on this team, but don't discount the 21-year-old winger or his diminutive frame. The 5-foot-7 DeBrincat has simply been a goal-scoring machine at every level of hockey, including 26 so far for the suddenly surging Blackhawks.
Previous ranking: 23
The best player in the world leads this team: 21-year-old Connor McDavid. He has scored or assisted on more than 50 percent of the team's 178 goals this season and, for better or worse, seems committed to being there as management tries to right this ship.
Previous ranking: 22
As the Ducks sink into the abyss -- only two wins since Dec. 18! -- it feels fitting that the best 23-and-under player was Ondrej Kase (11 goals and 20 points in 30 games), who is now out for the season as he'll have surgery on his torn labrum.
Previous ranking: 29
This season will be either be long forgotten, or celebrated in franchise folk lore as the time they really did lose for Jack Hughes. Either way, there is one player who has consistently produced in this journey: Dylan Larkin, who has a team-high 22 goals and 49 points.
Previous ranking: 30
On a team laden with aging contracts, there aren't many players (let alone young players) producing. Adrian Kempe, 22, has dipped in production from last season's level but still figures to be an important part of the future.
Previous ranking: 27
The Devils have 12 players 23 or under who have suited up this season. So far, the best has been Nico Hischier (16 goals, 20 assists), who this week wore an ""A"" on his jersey for the first time.
Previous ranking: 31
He's missed a handful of games this season, but Thomas Chabot is having a breakout campaign, especially offensively. The 22-year-old ranks ninth among defenseman with 0.89 points per game.

25933458,"The Washington Capitals captain picked up his 1,180th point on T.J. Oshie's goal that opened the scoring Tuesday in Washington's 3-2 win over the Vancouver Canucks. Ovechkin broke the record in his 1,055th game, 193 games fewer than Fedorov played.
""It's history, and I passed all those legends,'' Ovechkin said. ""It's pretty big and I appreciate everybody who do all work with me, my teammates, and it's huge. When you start playing hockey and you came to the NHL, you just have a dream to score one goal or two and now I'm No. 1 on the all-time Russian list.''
Ovechkin and Fedorov played together with the Capitals in 2008 and 2009 and remain friends. Ovechkin said he spoke with Fedorov and is sure the Hockey Hall of Famer is happy he passed him for this record.
""I knew eventually it's going to come, but it's pretty big,'' Ovechkin said. ""It's pretty huge. To be No. 1 on the all-time list, it's nice.''
The 33-year-old from Moscow leads the NHL with 37 goals and paces the Capitals with 58 points. He's coming off winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP as he led Washington to its first Stanley Cup in franchise history.
Ovechkin long ago passed Fedorov for the most goals among Russian-born players. He has 644 goals and 536 assists in his NHL career.
""We're so fortunate to have him here in Washington,'' coach Todd Reirden said. ""You take for granted what a special, special player he is, not even just here in Washington, but for the whole National Hockey League and how he's really been that second tier, maybe third tier of Russian players that have come over and now they just continue to turn out players.''

Nikita Kucherov has been the leading man all season. With a league-leading 88 points (and seven in his past two games), he could be staring at a Hart (Trophy) in June.

You can count on Joe Thornton to make a Monday night special. This Monday, he surpassed Gordie Howe for all-time career assists, passed Shane Doan and Johnny Buyck for games played, and tied Teemu Selanne for points.
Greg Wyshynski and Emily Kaplan begin the show discussing the future in Anaheim, with the firing of Randy Carlyle.

Despite their first three-game losing streak of the season, the Jets are back atop the West. They're hoping that true love can melt a frozen heart, with Patrik Laine looking to break out of a cold spell (two goals in his past 25 games).
Previous ranking: 2
We've admired the Flames all season, but it hasn't been a great February so far (one win in five games), as Matthew Tkachuk (eight-game goalless streak) and Johnny Gaudreau (six) are stuck in droughts.
Previous ranking: 5
Jake Muzzin and Auston Matthews? That's obvious. Lately, the Maple Leafs are low-key crushing on Andreas Johnsson; the Swede is coming into his own, especially after a recent seven-points-in-three-games stretch.
It's Jack Hughes and Kaapo Kakko leading the way, but how is the rest of the 2019 class shaping up? We rank the top 50 prospects for June's draft.
Pettersson is quickly adjusting to the spotlight for a Canucks team that has found itself in the Western Conference playoff hunt.
We're familiar with the names available. It's time to play matchmaker for all 31 NHL teams as the trade deadline nears.

What's so wrong about loving two goalies equally? Robin Lehner has gotten a bit more attention, but Thomas Greiss is only a slight step behind and has gone 4-0-1, saving 154 of 157 shots (.981 save percentage) in his past five games.
Previous ranking: 7
Predators fans better fall in love with Brian Boyle (and at least show some affection for Cody McLeod) because there's a chance that's all they're getting ahead of the trade deadline.
Previous ranking: 8
Are the Bruins once-bitten, twice-shy deadline lovers after the Rick Nash acquisition didn't yield a perfect connection a year ago? Perhaps, but we think they might swing for the big names this deadline anyway.
Previous ranking: 9
Nate Thompson was the more important acquisition (can kill penalties, is a left-handed faceoff specialist), but Dale Weise -- aka ""the Dutch Gretzky"" -- was already a cultish fan favorite from his previous service in Montreal.

You know you're madly, deeply in love when you won't hold a grudge. Evgeny Kuznetsov's early-season slide already feels long forgotten. The Russian center has seven goals and eight assists in his past nine games.
Previous ranking: 13
The Blue Jackets are so smitten, they're not even acting like themselves. Ever since Martin St. Louis signed on as a consultant, Columbus' woeful power play has gone 5-for-16 (31.3 percent), the third-best mark in the league in that span.
Previous ranking: 11
He has bounced in and out of the lineup and has a small sample, but Vegas fans have crushed on Brandon Pirri all season. He has 12 goals in 20 career games with the Knights.
Previous ranking: 10
GM Jim Rutherford acquires a player; the team is smitten. First this season, it was defenseman Marcus Pettersson. Now attention shifts to Nick Bjugstad, who already looks comfortable on the second line.
Previous ranking: 14
The 2018-19 Stars haven't established an identity yet, but plenty of teams envy their goaltending. Ben Bishop and Anton Khudobin have been spectacular (both have a save percentage of .924 or better).
Previous ranking: 17
You know when you were looking for love, and it was right in front of you all along? Micheal Ferland felt destined to be shipped at the deadline, but Carolina might now keep the winger as its own rental.
Previous ranking: 19
The Blues have been blinded by love in the form of a mystery newcomer. Jordan Binnington was a minor league afterthought to begin the season. This week, he was the NHL's No. 1 star (3-0, 1.31 goals-against average, .954 save percentage last week).

The Wild could be big players at the deadline, but first, they'll want to send a Valentine to one of their own: Zach Parise, a year removed from back surgery, is having his best statistical season since 2009-10.
Previous ranking: 16
The Sabres love their captain, Jack Eichel, for nixing euphemisms and telling it like it is. Like this declaration last week: ""I think the moral victories are a thing of the past at this point.""
Previous ranking: 21
Gritty might have had a two-month head start, but Carter Hart is making a late, great push to be Philadelphia's ultimate sweetheart. Over the past month, he's 8-1 with a .931 save percentage.
Previous ranking: 20
The Canucks have been swooning for their uber-rookie Elias Pettersson ever since his debut. The Swede is now the fastest rookie to 25 goals since Alex Ovechkin.
Previous ranking: 22
It has been a bumpy season for the Yotes, but Darcy Kuemper has been all right: Since Jan. 1, he's 8-2-3 with a .920 save percentage, including a 41-save win over Vegas on Tuesday.
Previous ranking: 18
Sometimes it feels like fans adore Colorado's top line and nobody else. But there has been some secondary scoring from an unexpected source: 33-year-old Carl Soderberg is trending for a career season.
Previous ranking: 25
Dylan Strome was a high draft pick in distress in Arizona. The Blackhawks saved him, and he's heating up (17 points in his past 10 games) while reigniting chemistry with former OHL teammate Alex DeBrincat.

Of course, Rangers fans are still in love with Henrik Lundqvist. But last week, we caught them sneaking glances at 23-year-old Alexandar Georgiev after he recorded 55 saves against Toronto, the second-highest one-game total in franchise history.
Previous ranking: 24
Since this season has been blah, it's all about lust for the Panthers. They're not exactly being coy about whom they're crushing on: Sergei Bobrovsky and Artemi Panarin.
Previous ranking: 29
On one hand, you have to like this team for not quitting on the season. But maybe it's time to lose for Jack Hughes?

Oilers players probably won't be giving chocolates to Ken Hitchcock, especially after the coach's public scolding about a lack of commitment last week.

The Red Wings have googly eyes for Gustav Nyquist. At 29, he's playing some of his best hockey and could yield one of the biggest returns in the trade market.

There isn't much to love in Anaheim right now. Sometimes, you just need to wallow in sadness before it can get better.

It could be a long, lonely Valentine's Day for the Devils, who have dropped eight of their past 11 and had to say goodbye to fan favorite Brian Boyle. They did add a local boy, though -- Morristown native Kenny Agostino -- via waivers.

Mark Stone and Matt Duchene have both expressed interest in sticking around, but the feelings might not be mutual (on contract terms, that is), and the Sens could be shipping one or both away.
