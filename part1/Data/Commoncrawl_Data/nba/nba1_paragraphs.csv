26013953,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Stephen Curry's storybook 3-point contest dream ended Saturday night at the hands of Brooklyn Nets sharpshooter Joe Harris.
Harris, who came into the weekend shooting a career-high 50.1 percent from 3-point land, stunned a capacity crowd in Curry's hometown by knocking down 26 points in the final round, beating Curry's score of 24.
""Obviously it's incredible,"" Harris said. ""Steph is the greatest shooter of all time. Again, shooting off of the rack for a minute is not indicative of being a better shooter than Steph Curry. I don't want anybody to get it twisted at all. He's come in and won this thing [in 2015] and lost. He's participated a number of different times. So for me to come in my first time and to win obviously is quite a surreal experience.""
The 27-year-old set the tone as the first shooter of the night, knocking down 25 points in the first round, including all five of his shots in the moneyball rack in the left corner.

""I think I was lucky to be the first guy to shoot,"" Harris said. ""Because I was able to get kind of warm beforehand, and you don't really have a ton of anxiety because you can't have time to think about it. You're going right into it, right into shooting.""
Despite Harris' strong effort at the beginning, it was Curry who electrified the crowd in the first round, scoring a high of 27 points, including knocking down all five shots in his own moneyball rack in the right corner. He received a loud ovation after the performance as he excitedly made his way back to the bench.
After Harris put up 26 to start the final round, Sacramento Kings swingman Buddy Hield managed just 19, clearing the way for Curry to win it at the end. Curry started strong, knocking down nine of his first 10 shots, but he cooled off in the middle two racks, missing four of his next 10 attempts. When he failed to hit his third attempt in the final moneyball rack, the contest was over.
Curry, who won the event in 2015, initially said this was ""most likely"" the final time he would participate in the event, but afterward said he didn't know whether he would come back toward the end of his career, as Dallas Mavericks great Dirk Nowitzki did Saturday night. Nowitzki finished with 17 points and did not advance.
OKC's Hamidou Diallo wowed the crowd by dunking over Shaquille O'Neal and hanging on the rim by his elbow, topping Dennis Smith Jr. in the final to win the NBA slam dunk contest.
Hamidou Diallo channeled Superman, Joe Harris upset Stephen Curry and Jayson Tatum showed off his skills with a half-court heave.
Here are the best highlight moments from the skills, 3-point and dunk contests during All-Star Saturday Night.
The big storyline coming into the event was that Curry, and his brother, Portland Trail Blazers guard Seth Curry, had a bet in which the loser had to pay for the winner's game tickets for family members each time they played for the rest of their careers. Seth finished with 16 points and did not qualify for the final round.
After it was over, Curry said he wasn't sure he would collect on the bet since neither he nor Seth won the contest. But when reminded by reporters that he had previously said the highest score between the two won the bet, he relented.
""A bet's a bet,"" Stephen said. ""He shook on it.""
Prior to the contest, Stephen and Seth's father, Dell, admitted he was rooting for Seth to win since Stephen had captured the contest in 2015. Dell, who played for the Charlotte Hornets for 10 years, participated in his own contest before the event, taking part in a joint one-minute round for charity alongside former shooting greats Ray Allen, Mark Price and Glen Rice. It was a moment that will not be soon forgotten for the Curry family.
""Honestly, I didn't think about it when I was out there,"" Stephen said of the bet. ""It was just, I was watching him, just smiling ear to ear, wishing every shot went in. I'm sure he was doing the same for me -- maybe he wasn't if he was trying to win the bet. But it was just ... and seeing my dad behind the bench and the whole family up in the crowd was cool. So I will remember this for a long time.""
Despite Stephen's best efforts to win at home, Harris ended the night with his own memory of a lifetime.
""I've said it a lot this weekend that a lot of guys in this league have got a unique path,"" Harris said. ""It sometimes takes guys longer than others. Some guys come in right away and are able to contribute. But I think you look at the makeup of our Brooklyn Nets team, and it's a lot of guys that were sort of cast off and had a second opportunity. I personally was one of those guys, and I got lucky going into a situation, going to a Nets organization that had such a strong value and emphasis on culture, skill development, and I'm sort of a byproduct of that system.""

26243462,"HOUSTON -- Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green said he isn't bothered by a video clip in which coach Steve Kerr appeared to express frustration toward him during Sunday night's home loss to the Phoenix Suns.
Though the audio is unclear in the video, which went viral after the game, Kerr appeared to say, ""I'm so f---ing tired of Draymond's s---.""
""It don't bother me,"" Green said after Tuesday's practice. ""S--- happens. It is what it is. I'm sure there's plenty of times coaches are tired of players. There's times players are tired of coaches. ... I don't take it personal. It is what it is.""
Green said he and Kerr didn't have to clear the air after the clip gained traction.
Golden State forward Kevin Durant, who suffered a sprained right ankle in Sunday's home loss to Phoenix, practiced Tuesday but will sit out Wednesday's game at Houston.
Warriors coach Steve Kerr used humor on Monday to downplay a viral video clip that appeared to show him making a comment about forward Draymond Green late in Sunday's loss to the Suns.
""There's nothing to clear,"" Green said. ""Like I said, s--- happens. We live in a day and age where there's a camera everywhere. So if anything, we'll probably be more conscious of that. But as far we need to clear the air, there's no air to clear.""
Kerr tried to diffuse the situation after Monday's practice with a little humor by saying that lip-readers misinterpreted his words.
""No, the lip-readers were wrong,"" Kerr said. ""What I said was, I beg to differ with Draymond's approach tonight. Those were my exact words. I don't know how somebody misconstrued that.""
Green, the emotional leader of the back-to-back NBA champions, took it all in stride on Tuesday. He said he wasn't surprised the clip received as much attention as it did.
""I guess I would be considered a millennial, huh? If I am considered a millennial, that is the day and age of social media, and I know how news spreads like wildfire,"" he said. ""So, no, I'm not surprised at all.""
Green said he wasn't concerned, because he wasn't going to let one comment in a heated moment change how he felt.
""Because someone else's opinion or how they necessarily may feel ain't getting me to where I am in the first place,"" Green said. ""So I don't really spend my time worrying about how anyone feels. I think everyone is entitled to their own feelings and opinions. So I don't take anyone's feeling or opinions personal because it's just that for them -- it's personal for them. So who am I to feel a way about how someone else may feel or feel in the moment? That's human nature, and we all have those [moments], so that's how I'm able to move forward.""

26228166,"In late June 2016, just days after winning one of the most thrilling and historically significant NBA Finals in history, David Griffin, then the Cleveland Cavaliers' GM, gathered his staff and gave them a directive: Explore ways to get Kevin Durant.
Everyone knew even getting a meeting was a long shot. They would have to gut most of their roster around LeBron James to acquire Durant. But they had to at least do their due diligence. By then, there was a creeping fear that Durant might really join the Golden State Warriors -- fresh off a 73-win season and Finals heartbreak at the expense of James and the Cavs. Everyone understood what that would do to the league's competitive landscape.
""I don't believe you can dream big enough in the NBA,"" Griffin says now in recalling that meeting. ""You have to go through the exercise.""
Durant's move has been on my mind -- and the minds of a lot of league insiders -- more than usual (sorry, KD!) in light of LeBron missing the playoffs for the first time since 2005. Does that failure impact LeBron's legacy? When we ask that question, we are really asking whether it cuts against his claim as the greatest player in the history of the sport over Michael Jordan. (You could nominate a few others -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell -- but in most discourse, it comes down to Jordan and James.)
Jordan didn't miss the playoffs until his late-30s Washington Wizards phase, which we have all agreed shouldn't really count for some reason. Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Bill Russell and Tim Duncan never did. Duncan played his entire career in the way superior Western Conference. James ran up eight straight Finals appearances against the junior varsity. One year in the real conference, and he's going to the lottery. That seems like a thing.Editor's PicksLowe's 10 things: Doncic, Paul George and CP3 swaggerThis week we highlight Chris Paul, Luka Doncic on D, quick-trigger techs and Hack-a-Shaq.Lowe Post: Arnovitz on Suns, Lakers, LeBronZach talks to ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz about his Suns feature (3:20), and LeBron and the Lakers likely missing the playoffs (48:43).1 Related
This week we highlight Chris Paul, Luka Doncic on D, quick-trigger techs and Hack-a-Shaq.
Zach talks to ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz about his Suns feature (3:20), and LeBron and the Lakers likely missing the playoffs (48:43).
LeBron isn't blameless amid the Lakers' organizational failure, but I'm not sure a 4-8 stretch should carry much (if any) weight in determining his place in history. That's what we're really talking about here: the Lakers' record with James in the lineup after his return from injury, and before they punted on the season following last Monday's loss to the Clippers. An aging superstar coming off the first serious injury of his career, clearly still finding his conditioning, could not carry an ill-conceived roster into the playoffs.
Before the injury, the Lakers were on track to be a mid-rung playoff seed. That is about right for a 34-year-old superstar with 56,000 career minutes under his belt playing in the West without an All-Star teammate. There was a time James could do more on his own. Everyone brings up the Cleveland team he carried to the Finals in 2007, but take a gander at the 66-16 Cavs of 2008-09.
Yikes. You could argue that roster fit LeBron better than the current Lakers' roster, at least relative to how much shooting we expected teams to have in 2009 versus 2019, but it wasn't exactly ahead of its time.
Those Cavs outscored opponents by 14.8 points per 100 possessions with LeBron on the floor, and lost the non-LeBron minutes by 7.9 points per 100 possessions. The gap between those two numbers -- 22.7 points per 100 possessions -- is the third-largest for a player in the NBA's database, which dates to 2007. (The two above him: Draymond Green and Stephen Curry in 2015-16. Curry and Chris Paul seasons comprise six of the top eight spots.)
LeBron was that great then, on both ends, but the Eastern Conference was also that pathetic -- especially after Kevin Garnett's leg injury in February 2009 crippled the best Celtics team of the Boston Big Three era. LeBron is older, and a little worse now. He is seventh all-time in combined regular-season and playoff minutes. He'll be sixth by the end of this season, and third -- behind only Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone -- by the end of next season.
LeBron is a solo star in his twilight. This is what happens to those sorts of players. Had he remained healthy, evidence suggests the Lakers would have been a solid playoff team -- a nice result for LeBron and the organization.
Something like the opposite has happened. Parceling out blame is tricky. LeBron is so powerful that separating him from any part of an organization is impossible. The midseason gambit to acquire Anthony Davis almost certainly doesn't happen, or become so public, without at least LeBron's tacit go-ahead. Those talks sapped morale, sources say. Ditto for Magic Johnson's post-deadline lecture about treating the Lakers' young players ""like babies."" LeBron's eye-rolling on-court scoldings, a staple whenever he feels things sinking, did nothing to reverse any of that. Unbecoming, but not new.
The Lakers, like the Cavs before them, found it hard to build any broader stylistic identity around LeBron on either end of the floor. Some within the Cavs theorized the team struggled to score with LeBron on the bench because they never developed any system beyond ""LeBron doing stuff.""
The Lakers tried to shoehorn a different offensive identity around LeBron with a series of nonsensical signings, and it is hilarious now to watch and listen as every branch of the organization deflects blame for those signings onto other parts of the organization. Pointing fingers is the surest sign of a rotten culture. In that end, those signings -- and the bizarre non-signing of Brook Lopez -- fall on the front office, regardless of who ""pleaded"" or ""suggested"" what, when, and to whom. (Lopez has said he would have been interested in returning had the Lakers asked him.)
It is really hard to develop any sort of defensive identity -- even a base system -- when your best player doesn't engage. The 2017-18 Cavs loafed on defense all season, and shockingly found it impossible to craft a workable strategy on the fly in the Finals.LeBron and the LakersThe Lakers' season is close to over.

Luke Walton and the players deserve credit for L.A. ranking within the top 10 in points allowed per possession before injuries to LeBron and Lonzo Ball. (They exceeded expectations on that end last season, too.)
Walton appears doomed, per several reports. He seemed happiest during his first season, when you could see glimpses of how he wanted to adapt some of Golden State's principles to a young core he found exciting. ""We want to see what this group can do,"" he told me in December 2016. ""We don't want to rely on free agency or trades.""
Over three years, the rotating cast of young guys coalesced only in flashes. Even before LeBron, it was hard to pin down what the Lakers wanted to be. Some of that falls on ownership and front office regimes prioritizing star-chasing over internal development.
Some falls on the coaches. It was Walton who shoved Lopez to the fringes of the rotation toward the end of last season. Brandon Ingram swung wildly from role player to wannabe alpha scorer, landing in the appropriate middle ground only for stretches. You never got the sense Walton truly believed in Julius Randle. (Randle's defense in New Orleans has been so terrible that I'm not sure his backers have won that debate.) Johnson didn't believe in D'Angelo Russell. We know because he told us.
But debate about this Lakers catastrophe always returns to LeBron and What It Means. He is 3-6 in the Finals, and very close -- a Ray Allen shot, some Draymond Green flagrant fouls -- from being 1-8. And then you remember: that third Finals victory, the capstone of LeBron's career, paved the way for Durant to go to the Warriors -- and effectively took LeBron's Cavaliers out of the next two Finals.
What if Durant had re-signed in Oklahoma City, or went anywhere else, and the 2017 Cavaliers faced the Warriors (or the Thunder, or some other team) in the Finals?
""It would have been a great series,"" Kevin Love told ESPN.com last week. ""With [Harrison] Barnes and [Andrew] Bogut, they were a really tough team that played so well together. [Durant] signing there shifted the NBA in a big way. It's still tilting the balance today."" Love added the Cavaliers were confident anyway before the 2017 Finals.
""I know we all believe -- and it's just our opinion -- that if Golden State brought back the same team [in 2017], we would have dominated,"" Richard Jefferson told ESPN.com.
Folks within the Cavs almost universally consider that 2017 team the best of the second LeBron era. They obliterated the East -- culminating in 44- and 33-point road wins in Boston in the conference finals. They entered the trilogy against Golden State with one of the half-dozen beefiest postseason scoring margins in league history.
We look back now, Cleveland having gone 1-8 over the past two Finals, and ask: Was Cleveland that good, or was the East that bad?2019 NBA draftGet ready for Zion Williamson, Ja Morant and more.• Latest NBA mock draft

You cannot wish away the conference imbalance from LeBron's career. It would have been exceedingly unlikely for his teams to make eight straight Finals had he played in the West. (He also could have won at least as many rings in some alternate ""LeBron plays in the West"" timeline.) That streak has almost erased from the consciousness the real black mark on his GOAT resume: his meltdown in the 2011 Finals against the Dallas Mavericks. That is the only one of LeBron's Finals defeats that was close -- the only one in which folks might argue he came in with the better team.
A theoretical 2017 Finals against the run-it-back Warriors might have been another -- or maybe a toss-up. A ring there -- a fourth title, and a 2-1 edge over Golden State -- would have removed the conference imbalance as a cudgel for anyone to use against LeBron now, at this low moment.
(Cleveland insiders lament the 2015 Finals at least as much. Love missed that whole series, a 4-2 Golden State win, and Irving was lost after busting his knee in Game 1. LeBron put forth perhaps his greatest playoff run ever last season, and almost won Game 1 of the 2018 Finals by himself. Multiple Golden State officials have told me it is the best game they have ever seen someone play in person. Last season still feels like a 4-1 Golden State win even if the Cavs steal Game 1.)
A win in 2017 might even have swayed Irving against requesting a trade, though as our Dave McMenamin first reported that summer, Irving had already withdrawn from teammates during that playoff run. You can pile what-if atop what-if when it comes to Durant's move, and all its ripple effects. That would-be 2017 Finals has always stood out.
Stack James and Jordan up against each other, and I'm not sure the conference thing matters, anyway. Jordan played his entire career in the East. It was better then -- and even had a winning record against the West during Chicago's second three-peat, per Pelton's research -- but the difference was not as large as we might remember.
During Jordan's six title runs, the four highest seeds in the East aside from the Bulls went a combined 1,259-709 -- a .640 winning percentage -- with an average net-rating of plus-4.8 points per 100 possessions, per ESPN Stats & Information research. The same subset during LeBron's run of eight straight Finals: 1,593-966 (.623), with a net-rating of plus-4.5. (Most of the East's superiority in Jordan's later Chicago years manifested in the middle and basement of the conferences.)
Chicago's East playoff fields included seven teams with net ratings of at least six points per 100 possessions, per Basketball-Reference. (Four of those seven ranged from plus-6.0 to plus 6.4.) LeBron's featured just three: the Bulls of 2011 and 2012, and last season's Toronto Raptors. An edge to Jordan, but a small one.
Derrick Rose's knee injuries wiped away LeBron's greatest potential long-term challenger for Eastern Conference supremacy. Other teams rose and fell -- the Pacers, then the Atlanta Hawks for one year -- but no true, lasting threat. Shaquille O'Neal's move from the Magic to the Lakers might have had a similar effect on the East during Jordan's second title run, though the 1997-98 Pacers rank among his toughest challengers.The Lowe Post podcastESPN's Zach Lowe talks to various basketball people about various basketball things.

Do all-time greats benefit from fallow periods within their conferences, or does their greatness almost accidentally produce them? Did LeBron leave the East at the right moment, or is the East gearing up because LeBron is aging and gone?
LeBron could have stayed in the East; the 76ers were one of several suitors that promised immediate title contention. LeBron chose the Lakers anyway. We can dissect his reasoning, but it is not debatable that he forfeited at least one season of chasing Jordan's ring count.
That one season, torpedoed by an injury, brings some uncomfortable questions but doesn't quite rise to the level -- to these eyes anyway -- of influencing the ongoing Jordan-LeBron argument. But the legacy discussion will take a weird turn if LeBron spends his L.A. years in decline, piling up numbers on mediocre teams. He wants to win. The Lakers need to win after six years of losing. The high pick they will get as a result of this disaster will help -- Durant leaving again would, too -- but it won't be enough on its own in 2020. They have to get this summer right.

26126958,"Count Boston Celtics co-owner Wyc Grousbeck among those disappointed with the team's performance of late.
Speaking Saturday at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, Grousbeck said the Celtics just finished the ""worst February"" he can remember since taking over the team in 2002. The Celtics were 5-6 last month, including a finishing stretch in which they lost four straight games.
Grousbeck acknowledged that the Celtics aren't necessarily worried about finishing with the best record in the Eastern Conference, adding that the team as constructed has ""the capability of getting to the Finals.""
""We also have the capability of losing in the first round,"" Grousbeck said, according to Boston.com. ""We have a very, very good set of opponents in the East, all of whom have beaten us in the last month.""
Grousbeck's uncertainty echoes comments that some of his team's players have made during the season. Amid that losing stretch to finish February, guard Marcus Smart said the team is ""just not together,"" while Kyrie Irving has more than once discussed the need for some of the younger Celtics players to mature and understand their roles.
Heading into Sunday's game against the Houston Rockets (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC), the Celtics (38-25) sit in fifth place in the Eastern Conference, two games behind the Philadelphia 76ers for fourth and home-court advantage in the first round.
""I really have a lot of hope for these guys,"" Grousbeck said. ""I give us a chance. I don't think anybody wants to play us in the playoffs. I really do think, after 16 years in the league, that these guys still have a chance.""
Grousbeck also took a positive spin on how this month has started.
""Thank God it's March,"" he said. ""We're undefeated in March.""

While he often splits his time on the hardwood playing in retro sneakers originally released over three decades ago, Tucker is also known to have a few performance favorites. He broke out a pair of the Kobe-led Zoom Huarache 2K4 from 2004 earlier in the week, which rank alongside the Kobe 4, Kobe 5, KD 2 and original Hyperdunk as some of his favorite basketball models from the brand.

""I think the Kobe 4 is the best basketball shoe EVER,"" Thomas recently tweeted.
Elsewhere in the league, Boston Celtics All-Star Kyrie Irving unveiled yet another well received player exclusive colorway of his fifth Nike Kyrie model, in vivid neon green and bright crimson tones, while the point guard for his previous team gave a nod to the early days of his signature series.
Thanks to the league's anything-goes color rules this season, Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Collin Sexton dusted off a pair of Kyrie 1 iDs from his high school days. The purposely mismatched and multicolored pair made years ago on Nike's customization website feature No. 32, his Hillgrove High jersey number from his sophomore season.
In just a short span, Sexton went from an unranked player making his way through the prep scene in Georgia to the starting point guard of Irving's former team.

26041744,"Father and son remember the stops at Fuddruckers in Columbia, S.C., more than halfway through the five-hour drive back to Charleston from Atlanta, where the son, only 12, had started practicing that summer with a high-level AAU team.
The son realized he was in over his head during warm-ups. The Atlanta players dunked. He wouldn't dunk until the end of sophomore year in high school. He would cry sometimes on drives back.
""I thought I was good,"" Khris Middleton says. ""I realized I was s---ty."" His father, James, had picked the Atlanta team to show his son how far he had to go. Fuddruckers became the place where Khris cheered up.
""I let him order whatever he wanted,"" James says. ""'Get yourself together. I cannot let you come into the house crying, or I'm going to be in trouble with your mother.'""
Middleton kept going back to Atlanta -- sometimes twice a week. Those practices marked the start of a jagged, improbable journey to Middleton's first All-Star appearance last week.
Halfway through high school, Middleton wasn't drawing interest from major nearby colleges. Dave Odom, then the coach of South Carolina, spotted Middleton as a sophomore while scouting other players. He asked John Pearson, Middleton's coach at Porter-Gaud School, if Middleton could dunk. He couldn't. Odom lost interest.
""He looked and played young,"" Odom says.
""His IQ was beyond his years,"" Pearson says, ""but he did not have the physical makeup to execute his ideas.""
Middleton hit a growth spurt that summer, and found his game. A lot of big programs -- including Clemson, his dream -- had already moved on. Middleton played an old-school, deliberate style that did not attract eyeballs. A couple of Texas A&M assistants who had never heard of Middleton before noticed him during AAU tournaments.
In the spring of his junior year, the Middletons had a family event in Shreveport -- a four-hour drive from A&M. They asked if they might visit. Someone -- no one can remember now -- sent DVDs of Middleton highlights to Mark Turgeon, A&M's head coach.
Turgeon thought Middleton looked young. ""He doesn't have any hair on his legs,"" Turgeon told Middleton's father as they strolled campus.
""Late bloomer,"" James replied.
Turgeon liked Middleton enough to offer a scholarship despite having never seen him play in person. Middleton soon committed. Turgeon called Scott Spinelli, an assistant who pushed for Middleton, to relay the news. ""Good news,"" Turgeon said. ""Khris committed. Bad news: This m-----f----- better be able to play.""Editor's PicksLowe: Ten things I like and don't like, including this MVP raceThis week we highlight the impossible Anthony Davis situation, chill mode LeBron and the thrills of Paul George and James Harden.Lowe Post: MacMahon on Harden, Rockets, MVP raceZach talks to ESPN's Tim MacMahon about the Rockets' progress, the MVP race and Paul George.1 Related
This week we highlight the impossible Anthony Davis situation, chill mode LeBron and the thrills of Paul George and James Harden.
Zach talks to ESPN's Tim MacMahon about the Rockets' progress, the MVP race and Paul George.
After two years at A&M, Middleton was a solid first-round NBA prospect. Turgeon convinced him to stay another year. That May, Turgeon took the University of Maryland job. A&M hired Billy Kennedy to replace him.
Kennedy and Middleton never clicked. Middleton tore the meniscus in his right knee in early November. He returned a month later but wasn't the same. ""He was skittish,"" Kennedy says. ""He played not to get hurt.""
His draft stock fell. Scouts -- the Thunder were especially interested, sources say -- heard rumblings Middleton was soft.
Detroit picked him 39th in 2012 -- nine picks after Middleton and his father, devastated at falling out of the first round, had stopped watching. ""I didn't see soft,"" says Joe Dumars, then the Pistons' GM. ""I saw a guy who played at his own pace.""
Observers confused languid style with lax effort. ""He looked so low motor,"" says Steve Hetzel, a Pistons assistant then who worked closely with Middleton. Hetzel nicknamed Middleton ""WD-40."" He once stashed a can in Middleton's locker.
But Middleton was still playing tentatively in his first summer league. He hadn't regained full strength in his knee.
Hetzel and Middleton were reviewing film in the lobby of the Grand Bohemian Hotel during the NBA's Orlando summer league when Dumars walked by. He paused to chastise Middleton about his effort. ""He almost had his finger in his face,"" Hetzel says.
""This isn't college,"" Dumars remembers saying. ""Turn it up.""
Hetzel doubled down. ""Your physicality has to change,"" Hetzel told him. ""You're playing soft. You're not making contact plays.""
Another assistant said Middleton ""floated"" through games. Six-plus years later, that word came up again when Mike Budenholzer, the new Milwaukee Bucks coach, benched Middleton during a Dec. 1 loss to the Knicks. Middleton had reached half-heartedly for two loose balls.
By then, Budenholzer and Middleton had already reviewed film of Middleton falling short on hustle plays. Middleton was struggling to adapt to Budenholzer's offensive system, which did not offer as many one-on-one opportunities in Middleton's pet midrange, and letting the uncertainty infect other parts of his game.
""Things frustrated me and it was coming out the wrong way,"" Middleton says. ""I was floating through possessions. I was being used as a 3-point shooter instead of as someone who can do lots of things. [Budenholzer] saw that.""
Budenholzer has tried to be less dogmatic -- to meet Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo in the middle. But he has been blunt about floating. ""[The benching] wasn't out of nowhere,"" Budenholzer says. ""Khris has another gear. We need him to get to that gear more. We are demanding. If your best players aren't doing it, you're f---ed.""
The Bucks have since established themselves as the league's best team outside Oakland. Middleton has accepted Budenholzer's request to shoot more 3s -- something Jason Kidd, Budenholzer's predecessor, also asked of him, according to player and coach. A big contract -- and a fork-in-the-road moment for the Bucks -- awaits.
""It's amazing how Khris has grown,"" Antetokounmpo says. ""As a team, we have clicked. It is something special.""
In Detroit, Middleton fell behind fellow rookies Kyle Singler and Kim English. His right leg -- the one in which he tore his meniscus a year earlier -- would sometimes swell. Lawrence Frank, Detroit's coach, thought he was lacking on defense. ""If Lawrence didn't think you could guard, you weren't playing,"" says Dee Brown, an assistant on that Pistons staff.
One-on-one and 2-on-2 battles against English, Singler, and Brown -- before games or after practices -- became Middleton's games. They kept score. Trash talk flowed. ""It was sacred ritual,"" Brown says. The rookies knew coaches were watching. Middleton went at English, taken five spots behind him, with special zeal.
""It was absolutely cutthroat,"" English recalls. Greg Monroe sometimes stuck around after practice to watch, he says.
""It got personal,"" Brown says. ""He didn't say it, but Khris always thought he was better than Kim."" Games turned physical. ""I would tell Khris, 'You can't push a coach!'"" Brown says, laughing.
Three years later, Middleton channeled that same competitive rage into a higher-end roster battle: against Antetokounmpo, for alpha status in Milwaukee. In the winter of 2015, Kidd sensed an unspoken tension as Middleton, Antetokounmpo, Monroe, and Jabari Parker felt out a hierarchy. He wanted it in the open. He interrupted a film session and asked every player on the roster, one by one, who was best among them.
""It was awkward,"" Middleton says. Most nominated Middleton. Antetokounmpo refused to go along. ""He was stubborn,"" Monroe says.
""Khris was better then,"" Antetokounmpo admits.
Middleton and Antetokounmpo ratcheted up the physicality defending each other in practice. ""We were fighting for that top spot, and we were almost actually fighting,"" Antetokounmpo says. ""I would come home with bruises and scratches.""
That level of competition seemed a long way off in Detroit in 2012. Back then, Middleton asked Brown for tips on just sticking in the league. ""He was authentic,"" Brown says. ""A lot of guys think they are something they're not and get disappointed when it doesn't go their way.""
In December 2012, amid a streak of 35 consecutive games in which Middleton did not play, the Pistons finally sent him to the D-League. ""He was upset,"" Monroe says. ""I told him he needed to play somewhere.""
Hetzel watched one of Middleton's D-League games and called with observations. He was not sure Middleton would be enthusiastic about dissecting D-League film.
""He was locked in,"" Hetzel says. ""There is beauty in a player who falls, and grows from it.""
Middleton had always embraced work. James gave no quarter in father-son backyard one-on-one games. ""I played to beat him,"" James says. He would force Khris left -- to work on his weak hand.
An oak tree hung near the family hoop, limbs jutting into shooting paths from various angles. Middleton asked his father to trim them. His father told him to shoot around them. Middleton would shoot long into the night. He once kept shooting during a lightning storm, finally cowering under the tree. His father screamed from the doorway: ""Get your ass out from under that tree! That's the worst place to be!""
Middleton's jumper was pure even then. Midway through his rookie season, teammates and coaches noticed how he used learners, step-backs, and other tricks of footwork to get it off whenever he wanted -- even if he rarely blew by anyone. Tayshaun Prince nicknamed him ""Baby Joe Johnson.""
Still, the Pistons were not worried they had (reluctantly) traded a future All-Star when they included Middleton for salary-matching purposes in the 2013 Brandon Jennings-Brandon Knight swap with Milwaukee. ""I thought he might become a good rotation guy,"" Brown says. ""I never expected this.""
The Bucks finished a league-worst 15-67 in Middleton's first season there, but he established himself as a solid starter. He felt chemistry with Knight and a freakish rookie from Greece. ""As terrible as we were, that was one of my favorite years,"" Middleton says. ""We knew there was something -- that someday, we could play at a high level.""
Milwaukee fired Larry Drew that offseason and poached Kidd from the Nets. Kidd immediately targeted Middleton as someone who could do more. During a late December practice in 2014, Kidd ripped Middleton in front of the team, telling him he ""sucked,"" the two recall. ""That was our first encounter,"" Kidd says. ""You always remember your first encounter.""
Middleton fired back. Kidd didn't mind. He wanted Middleton, an introvert, to speak up. Kidd also sensed Middleton could take it, and set an example in doing so: No one is above hard coaching. ""I loved it,"" Middleton says. ""He fired me up.""
Kidd pushed Middleton to get better at everything: defend harder, hone his passing, bully smaller guys in the post, get more comfortable going right -- going left against his father might have tilted him too far -- and shoot more 3s. Middleton was versatile enough to do it all. Pearson, his high school coach, favored positionless basketball. He refused to label Middleton, and urged him to play all over the court -- including in the post after his growth spurt.
""He resisted,"" Pearson says. ""But I wasn't going to pigeonhole him.""
He resisted Kidd's entreaties to shoot more 3s too. Middleton tried fewer than four per game; Kidd dared him to double his attempts in some games. ""I was stubborn,"" Middleton says.
He blossomed anyway. Middleton averaged 18 points in 2015-16, and received All-Star consideration. He was primed to make it the next season. But at the end of a September practice, Middleton slipped on wet spot, and tore his left hamstring muscle completely off the bone.
Wet spots were common at the Bucks' old practice facility, housed in the back of a Catholic church, whenever it rained or snowed. Wiping them required extreme diligence. ""Someone didn't clean the court,"" says Marc Lasry, one of the team's owners.
Middleton called his older sister, Brittney, perhaps his closest confidante. She could hear his voice cracking. ""It was the whole injury cycle -- again,"" she says.
After surgery, Middleton couldn't travel with the team. He couldn't drive. Climbing stairs in his four-floor townhouse was treacherous.
He called Travis Smith, a childhood friend and high school teammate, and asked if Smith might visit. Smith knew what Middleton meant: Help me. Smith stayed six weeks. He helped with shopping, cooking, managing stairs. Middleton's stitches ruptured several times. Blood poured out. Each rupture delayed his rehab.
""Travis held me together,"" Middleton says.
They geeked out on League Pass. Middleton watched as Antetokounmpo ended any debate about who stood as Milwaukee's franchise player. ""He goes out, and Giannis becomes an All-Star,"" Lasry says. ""Think how some guys might have reacted.""
Middleton found watching from afar gave him perspective on ways he could help beyond scoring. He attended coaches meetings. He craved being around the team, just as he had the last time he almost completely lost basketball: ninth grade, when a D grade in Spanish pushed him below the academic floor for athletes.
His parents took his basketball away. They would not let him watch his team's games (still junior varsity then) from the stands. He could either stay home, or sit on the bench in street clothes -- where everyone would see him, and know he had done something wrong. Middleton answered right away that he would sit on the bench with his teammates.
""I damn near cried,"" his father says. ""He showed me what he was made of."" He studied harder, and got his grades up.
He attacked hamstring rehab the same way. Once the stitches came out, it went smoothly. Reattaching the hamstring had been easy; the muscle had stayed near the bone instead of drifting. ""We didn't have to go down the leg and fish it out,"" says Troy Flanagan, the team's performance director.
Even so, some feared Middleton would never be the same. ""It was, 'Who knows how he comes back from this?'"" Kidd remembers.
Flanagan was confident. Middleton's top sprinting speed might take a hit, but that was more important for NFL players. By retraining muscles and movement patterns -- and Middleton's diet -- the performance staff hoped to make him more athletic.
Middleton's hamstring strength -- based on pushing and pulling exercises -- doubled post-injury, Flanagan says. His runs faster side-to-side.
Games are different, and Middleton wasn't himself when he returned in February 2017. He averaged 14 points on 40 percent shooting as Toronto eliminated Milwaukee in the first round.
He played that series through severe strep throat. Abscesses -- collections of pus -- developed along the inside of his throat. He couldn't eat solid foods; he subsisted on smoothies. He couldn't turn his head side-to-side. Middleton's father stayed with him; Middleton texted him even when they were in the same house.
""I was shocked he played the last game,"" Flanagan says.
After that game, Middleton went to the hospital for an IV. Middleton's father and a nurse then held him down -- one arm each -- while a doctor stuck a needle down his throat to drain pus and blood.
When John Hammond, then the Bucks' GM, learned the extent of Middleton's health issues, he took a Middleton bobblehead from his office cabinet, perched it on his desk, and used it as a prompt during exit interviews, teammates recall: We all need to put ourselves on the line like this guy.
Milwaukee had high expectations for 2017-18, but the Bucks hovered around .500 into late January. Opponents had learned to slice through Kidd's trapping defense. Parker's return from knee surgery imperiled chemistry. Players grew weary of Kidd's confrontational style.
Kidd felt it. On Jan. 20 in Philadelphia, two days before his firing, he asked Middleton, ""Do you need another coach?"" both recall. Middleton replied that he would do his job regardless. ""You could tell the team was going away from him,"" Middleton says. ""I couldn't pin it all on him. It is never all one person's fault. Jason and I had had a great relationship.""
They regrouped under Joe Prunty, an interim replacement, and extended Boston to seven games in the first round. Middleton destroyed every Celtic who guarded him. He averaged 25 points on 60 percent shooting.
""I couldn't even believe myself at times,"" he says. Teammates could.
""You give Khris a series where he sees the same coverages,"" John Henson says, ""and you're going to see that a lot.""
The Bucks hired Budenholzer to recalibrate their team on both ends. That included recalibrating Middleton's offense. Over a mid-May breakfast with Antetokounmpo and Middleton before his formal hiring, Budenholzer told Middleton he would have to shoot more 3s within an offense featuring fewer set plays.
Middleton spent the summer practicing his usual shot diet, only from farther out. He intensified his training. He told coaches he felt as if ""he was losing his legs"" toward the end of the Boston series, and wanted to be ready for a longer playoff run, says Charles Lee, an assistant under Budenholzer.
Lee visited Middleton last summer. He expected Middleton to use a private gym, and an expensive trainer. He found Middleton lifting on his own at Porter-Gaud, the school's football players working around him.
Middleton kicked a Lucky Charms addiction in favor of turkey sausage and egg whites. He tried salad even though he hates cold foods.
The goal: a breakout year. It has happened for the Bucks, but only kind of for Middleton. His scoring and shooting numbers are down. Finding shots in Budenholzer's flowing system has proven harder than either expected. ""He was fighting it,"" Budenholzer says. ""We need to find balance, him and I.""
But peak Middleton is a snug complement for Antetokounmpo: an ace shooter who can space the floor, score late in the shot clock, and defend multiple positions.
Milwaukee will need peak Middleton to bust through the East, and compete with (at least) Boston and Philadelphia beyond this season. He is not as good as the typical second banana on a title team. The Bucks hope to compensate with depth and fit -- and with Middleton raising his level to at least approximate that championship second banana when it matters.
Milwaukee's playoff performance could shape its future. If the Bucks pay all their free agents -- Middleton, Eric Bledsoe, Brook Lopez, Malcolm Brogdon -- they could be locked into that roster through Antetokounmpo's prime. Is that good enough?
Middleton hopes so, and wants to stay. Milwaukee fits his low-key personality. ""It has to be the right situation,"" he says. ""But I feel like we have a team that can compete.""
He is fine with his role next to Antetokounmpo. ""People expect us to be more buddy-buddy, but it's not like that,"" he says. ""We're friends. We respect each other. We need each other.""
The Bucks know they might have to pay $30 million per season to keep Middleton. ""Does he love Milwaukee enough to re-sign?"" Lasry asks. ""Yes. Enough to give us a real discount? No.""
Middleton isn't thinking beyond this season. He just wants to get out of the first round.
""I don't want to be one of those players who has a good career but couldn't get out of the first round,"" Middleton says. ""We've had three tries. We want to go deep.""

26242510,"During ""The Michael Kay Show"" on 98.7 ESPN New York on Tuesday, Dolan called the confrontation an ""ambush"" and said the fan sold the video to TMZ.
""The ban is only coming from the fact that we now have learned that he planned it,"" Dolan said. ""They were stalking me. You can't do that in Madison Square Garden. You are not allowed to stalk the owner and then confront him like that.

""Those particular guys had planned on making that video and selling it on TMZ.""
The exchange began when the fan yelled at Dolan to ""sell the team"" as he was walking into the tunnel. The billionaire stopped and responded, ""So you think I should sell the team?"" and waved the fan over.
""You want to not come to any more games?"" Dolan asked, adding that the fan's comment was rude.
When the fan protested by saying he was just stating his opinion, Dolan answered: ""No, it's not an opinion. And you know what, enjoy watching them on TV.""
Dolan then pointed to the fan and nodded toward security, who instructed the fan to be held. TMZ reported security and police questioned the man before asking him to leave the arena.
Dolan said Tuesday he had originally planned on inviting the fan back and letting him meet the team in an effort to show him that the franchise was headed in a positive direction. However, he said, that changed when it ""became clear that the whole thing was planned.""
New York Knicks owner James Dolan instructed security to detain a fan who told him to ""sell the team"" after Saturday's loss to the Sacramento Kings at Madison Square Garden.

When asked if his conduct will affect the team's chances of landing upcoming free agents such as Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, Dolan said no.
""I can tell from what we've heard, I think we're going to have a very successful offseason when it comes to free agents,"" Dolan said, without naming any specific players.
Dolan also addressed rumors that he was considering selling the team.
""For the record, I am not selling the team and I am not quitting,"" Dolan said.

26082053,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- With the Los Angeles Lakers taking a one-step-forward, two-steps-backward approach to their post-All-Star playoff push following another defeat at the hands of a lesser opponent, LeBron James was asked if the pressure of it all was becoming a distraction to his team.
""At this point if you are still allowing distractions to affect how the way you play, then this is the wrong franchise to be a part of and you should just come and be like, 'Listen, I don't [think this is for me]. I cannot do this,'"" James said following a 110-105 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday.
LeBron James cracked the top 10 in career assists Monday and became the first player in league history to rank in the top 10 all time in both assists and scoring. He currently ranks ninth and fifth, respectively.
Will the Lakers make the playoffs? Kevin Pelton breaks down the tightest races.
The loss to a Grizzlies team that is 14 games under .500 came on the heels of a loss to a New Orleans Pelicans team that is eight games under .500 and was playing without its star, Anthony Davis.
And the Lakers' 0-2 road trip quickly erased any momentum they hoped to have generated from their 19-point comeback victory over the Houston Rockets in their first game out of the All-Star break last week.
With 22 games remaining in the regular season, the Lakers are tied for 10th in the Western Conference standings, trailing the San Antonio Spurs for the eighth and final playoff spot by three games.
""Like, seriously, if you're distracted by playoff pushes out of all the stuff that's been talked about this year, nah,"" James said. ""Just come and do your job. We do our job at a high level and that's not a distraction. That's what you want. That's what you want every game. You want to feel like you're fighting for something.""
After suspensions, coaching rumors, trade talks, injuries and a locker room that has appeared disjointed at times, the Memphis game was mercifully just about basketball. And the Lakers showed more fight Monday than they did in New Orleans, but couldn't bring the score any closer than two points in the fourth quarter after trailing by as many as 11.
James' career numbers took a leap forward -- he became the only player in league history to rank in the top 10 in both career scoring and career assists after passing Andre Miller for No. 10 on the assists list, and his 24 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists moved him past Wilt Chamberlain for No. 5 on the all-time triple-doubles list with 79 -- but it came on a night when he shot just 8-for-23 from the floor with five turnovers.
Still, despite playing on a sub-.500 team the latest into a season since his second year in the league back in 2004-05 with the Cleveland Cavaliers, James expressed optimism -- a sentiment echoed by most of the Lakers' locker room.
""Just stay positive. That, you know, starts with me,"" James said. ""I just got to stay positive. Keep knocking on the door. And I felt like if we play like we did tonight, then we got to continue that consistent effort, that will get us over the hump as we make this push.""

Kyle Kuzma, who scored 22 against Memphis, noticed the change in team vibe after he challenged his teammates for their inconsistent body language in his comments to the media following the loss to the Pelicans.
""It felt different,"" he said. ""New Orleans, thought we was just hopeless out there. We didn't really get the lead back at all, and tonight we fought. But at the end of the day, a loss is a loss and no matter what way you spin it, you still put an L in that column.""
Lakers coach Luke Walton lauded his team's ""effort and togetherness,"" and also suggested that the disappointment from the loss was necessary to dwell on between now and their next game on Wednesday hosting those same Pelicans that just beat his team.
""One game. Feel this pain. Let's not try to run from it,"" he said. ""It should hurt that we lost, that we went 0-2 on this trip. But the only thing that matters is the next game, the chance to redeem ourselves against New Orleans. We don't need to look further than that. That's all that we can control as a group. So that's where we need our mindset to be.""
Or, as Brandon Ingram, who kept up his personal sharp play with a game-high 32 points, put it: ""There's a certain fire that comes out when you continue to get what you don't want. I think that's where the hurt comes from, the chance for us to win.""

26028056,"James Harden cites necessity as the root of his historic scoring streak, stressing that the Houston Rockets have needed him to go on the run that has him chasing Wilt Chamberlain.
Harden has scored at least 30 points in 31 consecutive games, tying Chamberlain for the second-longest such streak in NBA history behind the Hall of Fame center's 65-game run. The Rockets are 21-10 during Harden's streak despite Houston's other stars -- guard Chris Paul and center Clint Capela -- missing extended time because of injuries.
""The scoring streak is obviously amazing, but it's something that I just had to do because of our situation,"" Harden said in a sit-down interview with ESPN's Rachel Nichols. ""We had all the injuries and guys in and out of the lineup and things like that. So I think the streak just started happening, and now it's like something to talk about.
""But it's not something that I'm really honestly focused on. That's something I have to do in order to give us a chance to win the game.""
For the 31st consecutive game, Rockets star James Harden finished with at least 30 points, putting him in rare company alongside Wilt Chamberlain for the second-longest streak in NBA history.
Harden is averaging 41.5 points on 27.3 field goal attempts during his streak. His burden in the Rockets' offense became bigger than ever with the 33-year-old Paul missing 18 games because of a strained hamstring and chipping off rust in eight games since returning. Capela, the primary beneficiary of Harden's passing wizardry, has missed the past 15 games because of a right thumb injury and could return as soon as Thursday against the Los Angeles Lakers.
Harden acknowledged that it's sometimes difficult to block out criticism of his isolation-intensive playing style, particularly when it comes from former players.
""Yeah, I hear it. It's hard not to hear it -- especially nowadays,"" Harden told Nichols. ""You have social media. You have fans that are reading what people saying and ask me about it ...
""I try my best to block [criticism] out, but it's kind of hard, you know? Especially when it's coming from like ex-NBA players, you know? So it makes it more difficult, but, obviously, everybody's entitled to their own opinion.""
Harden recently agreed with Kobe Bryant when the Lakers legend said, ""I don't think that style of basketball is ever going to win championships,"" during an ESPN appearance.
Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen, appearing on ESPN's The Jump, recently referred to Harden's run as ""not even attractive basketball"" because he dribbles and dominates the ball so much.
Fellow former MVP Stephen Curry, while wearing a microphone for NBA TV, revealed in a conversation during Saturday's All-Star practice that Harden adamantly declared that he'd like to share the ball more.
""It's interesting because I was talking to James in the back, obviously complimented him on what he's done,"" Curry said while chatting with Milwaukee Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. ""The first thing he said was like, 'Yeah, this is fun, but I wanna play different [than] like playing by myself, whatever, hero ball.' But like the people want him to play like that in a system where they can actually play beautiful basketball with guys that know how to play.""

26021252,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- In Stephen Curry's homecoming, Kevin Durant stole the show.
Durant scored a team-high 31 points for Team LeBron, helping to lead his team of All-Stars back from a 20-point deficit in a 178-164 win over Team Giannis and winning All-Star MVP for the second time in his career.
Kevin Durant and Team LeBron put on an epic show -- and comeback -- in Charlotte, and Giannis Antetokounmpo had the dunk of the night. We're handing out grades for every player in the All-Star Game.
Team LeBron and Team Giannis put on a show in Charlotte. Here is every big moment from the 2019 All-Star Game.
Future Hall of Famers Dirk Nowitzki and Dwyane Wade went out in style in their All-Star swan song, and Wade said he was more than content with it. ""The game is in good hands,"" Wade said. ""So it's easy to walk away right now.""
Durant, who last won the award in 2012, shot 10-for-15 from the floor (6-for-9 from 3) as Team LeBron set an All-Star Game record for most made 3s in a game with 35.
""We just didn't want to lose,"" Durant told ESPN's Rachel Nichols after accepting the MVP trophy on the court after the game. ""We know we had a lot of talent over there that can do multiple things. We just wanted to turn it up a bit on the defensive side. I think the group closed the third quarter really changed the game for us. It is fun being around such greatness. Seeing how these guys operate on the day to day. I'll miss my time here.""
He added 7 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 blocks as LeBron James improved to 2-0 as a captain since the NBA All-Star Game changed to a draft format last year. Durant paid off as James' No. 1 overall pick in the draft.
""It's all sweet to me,"" Durant said when asked to compare the award to his other career accomplishments. ""I mean, it's hard to rank. Everything's special. But it's cool to be out there with some of the best players to ever play the game, and to win an MVP here in front of my family and friends is pretty sweet. I just keep trying to rack them up, I guess.""
The 11-year veteran's trophy case is getting mighty crowded these days after he took home back-to-back NBA Finals MVP awards for the Golden State Warriors' championships the last two years.
Durant, who is not expected to opt in to the final year of his contract, worth $31.5 million, with the Warriors and instead test free agency this summer, was asked if there were any teammates in particular he enjoyed playing with on Team LeBron.
Several of his teammates -- Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard and Klay Thompson -- are also expected to test free agency this summer. James' team, the Los Angeles Lakers, will have the salary cap space to sign a max free agent of Durant's caliber.
Kevin Durant explains how Team LeBron turned it on after halftime and appreciates all the great players competing on the floor together.
""Every one of them,"" Durant said, not offering any clues. ""I think every one of these guys, you can relate to them on a different level. A lot of these guys come from the same background and same circumstances, so you relate to them on a different level. All our skills match with each other. So you've got guys that can play four positions out there. So you don't mind sitting in the corner waiting for the ball to come to you for a 3.
""So you don't really have to do too much when you're playing with so many great players. You can do what you're just best at.""
Durant went 4-for-4 from the field (3-for-3 from 3) in the fourth quarter as Team LeBron pulled away.
At halftime, with Team LeBron trailing by 13 points, James asked coach Mike Malone if he and his teammates could leave the locker room to see rapper J. Cole perform his halftime set out on the court.
""I said, listen, I'll let you go watch the concert if you promise to get your ass back in transition,"" Malone said. ""LeBron made my words known, they watched the concert, and they came out and played great.""
Team LeBron allowed 69 points in the second half after giving up 95 points in the first two quarters.
""Coach Malone said the record [for points allowed] is 194, and we don't want to get that put on us,"" Durant said, revealing another motivation tactic of the Denver Nuggets' coach. ""So I think guys just buckled down and wanted to win after a while.""
Curry, who played for Team Giannis, scored 17 points on 6-for-23 shooting (4-for-17 from 3), adding nine rebounds and seven assists.
Damian Lillard, who scored nine of his 18 points in the third quarter to aid in the comeback alongside Durant, was asked to assess Durant's performance considering how much he has been in the news this season -- from commenting that stars didn't want to play alongside James to sniping at a reporter for speculating he could join the New York Knicks this summer.
""I don't think the news had anything to do with it,"" Lillard said. ""I think we all know the kind of player he is. Down the stretch of this game, he's hitting big shot after big shot. I think that's the most important thing. We know he's a very, very high-level basketball player, and from being around him, you see that he's just a regular dude. He comes off pretty genuine to me.
""So I think you hear people saying stuff about he's sensitive and all those types of things, but you also want a genuine person. So I think people got to choose. But that's the way he comes off to me when I've been around him.""
"
26219678,"PHILADELPHIA -- As the Philadelphia 76ers have navigated major roster turnover and accelerated playoff goals, coach Brett Brown has returned to his mantra: ""It all comes down to how the plane lands on April 15.""
The health of Joel Embiid will dictate what Philadelphia's playoff path will be.
Less ubiquitous than ""all is well that ends well,"" Brown has used this saying as an anchor. The ups and downs of individual regular-season games are trivial, the saying goes, so long as the Sixers are a healthy, well-oiled machine come the postseason.
""You're going to hear this a lot,"" Brown said. ""It's all about landing the plane. Healthy, spirit, me figuring out the best way to substitute, the group playing for each other. It is still and always will be about a team. I mean this sincerely: That rules my world.""
The Sixers have had their fair share of trials over the course of the season. Brown has worked to integrate fiery Jimmy Butler and sharpshooter Tobias Harris -- both new to the team this season -- into Philadelphia's system. The team just had to fight through eight games without their dominant and emotional franchise center in Embiid, who was sidelined with a sore left knee.
The Sixers looked one step closer to playoff form on Sunday afternoon. Embiid returned for his first game since the All-Star break and the Sixers defeated the Indiana Pacers 106-89. The 76ers moved into third place in the Eastern Conference with the win over the Pacers, who dropped to fourth place.
Philadelphia now has 15 regular-season games remaining the get fully healthy, iron out their chemistry kinks and find a rhythm.
""There is enough time, I believe, to figure out proper rotations and how to integrate Joel back into this mix,"" Brown said. ""There are many pieces that equal we are ready to go play in the NBA playoffs. And right now we are cramming.""
Before Sunday's game, Brown said he expected to play Embiid in four-minute spurts because the big man's conditioning level was a ""C"". In the first half, Embiid was on the floor for short stints, but as the game went on and Embiid found his footing, Brown left him in for longer and longer stretches.
In the end, Embiid played nearly 28 minutes and put up 33 points and 12 rebounds.
""It felt good,"" Embiid said. ""A little bit rusty. As the game kept going, I just kept getting better.""
The foursome of Ben Simmons, JJ Redick, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris has been dominant in 83 minutes on the floor together with Joel Embiid, especially defensively. But the Simmons/Redick/Butler/Harris foursome on the floor has been extremely average in 159 minutes without Embiid.
Still, there is more work to be done.
The Sixers relied on heavy minutes from their starters against the Pacers. While Philadelphia was dominant in the final quarter, the Pacers had a more balanced offensive performance. The Pacers' bench outscored the Sixers' bench 37-21.
Philadelphia also will be looking to spark JJ Redick, who has struggled offensively since the All-Star break. Redick, who the Sixers rely on to space the floor with his 3-point shooting, finished 3-of-6 from deep on Sunday. It was just the second time since the break that he shot 50 percent or better from the 3 line. In Wells Fargo Center, the crowd seemed to inflate every time Redick was poised to shoot from 3 and explode every time the shot went in.
Redick's slump has coincided with Embiid's absence. Entering Sunday's contest, Redick had shot 41 percent from the 3 arc with Embiid on the court and just 29 percent when Embiid was out.
""I think JJ will welcome Joel back as warmly as any of us,"" Brown said. ""If you say, 'Why do they pair up better?' I feel like Joel has become an effective screen setter. They've learned how to time things. I do feel like Joel coming back, JJ will be thrilled about that.""
Joel Embiid had 33 points and 12 rebounds in his first game in nearly a month, leading the 76ers past the Pacers 106-89 on Sunday.
The Pacers have been resilient without Victor Oladipo, but Giannis Antetokounmpo showed them how tough the road ahead can be.
On the health front, Boban Marjanovic remains out with a knee injury, although Brown said he is getting ""closer"" to returning. Butler was experiencing foot pain late in Sunday's game and didn't play the final four minutes. Embiid and Brown will confer with the Sixers' medical staff to evaluate how Embiid's minutes will be managed for the remainder of the regular season. Embiid said it is not out of the question for him to sit out more games to ensure that he is fresh come playoff time.
""It is all about load management,"" Embiid said. ""I wouldn't say it is 100 percent, because as an NBA player, you basically can never be 100 percent. Everything is basically sore. You just have to push through it depending on the pain.""
Brown said he can feel that the team senses ""it is getting to be go time."" Before every game now, Brown projects a number onto the locker room video screen. On Sunday, the number was 16. Next game, it will be 15.
""We are on the clock,"" Brown said. ""I think that the sense of urgency and awareness of [the level] we are getting close to having to perform at is real for these players.""

26262545,"Back with 10 more things:
The Timberwolves have petered out amid injuries and a hail of enemy 3-pointers, but beleaguered Minny fans can take heart in these two realities:
• Towns has posted up more than any player since the Jimmy Butler trade;
• The Wolves have scored at a rate of a top-3 offense with Towns on the floor since December.
Towns is the league's best hope for a sustainable, old school-ish inside-out offense -- even a tick above Joel Embiid. He can do pretty much anything from any spot below the foul line, and that versatility makes him unguardable one-on-one. He is a slightly better passer than Embiid, with a lower turnover rate.
Towns is slinging about four assists per game since the Butler deal, up from about 2.5 before. He is patient reading help schemes, watching cutters whir around, and firing crosscourt passes that travel one link further along the chain than the defense expects:
Towns is averaging 35 points per game on 60 percent shooting since the All-Star break. It has been a joke watching teams try to guard him. Only foul trouble can stop him. He is on pace for a second consecutive 50-40 shooting season, and he is a slightly improved free throw stroke -- 84 percent career -- from becoming the second big man ever to post a 50-40-90 season. (You know the other guy.)
The Wolves have poured in 1.2 points per possession on any trip featuring a Towns post-up since the Butler deal, one of the best marks in the league, per Second Spectrum. Consider that Robert Covington, Jeff Teague, Andrew Wiggins, Derrick Rose, and Tyus Jones all missed significant chunks of that time. Imagine when Towns can pass to more starter-level players?
He's still not good enough on defense, but when he tries, he's solid. On the other end, he's an undisputed foundational superstar.
I like when the Bucks attack the paint in methods a little outside their core offense:
Only the Sixers and Warriors set fewer ball screens than Milwaukee, per Second Spectrum. The same trio have their screeners slice to the rim (as opposed to popping) least often. That is not a bad thing! It's notable that so many of the league's best offenses -- also including Denver and Toronto -- rank toward the bottom in on-ball picks. There might be something to the notion that the more raw talent and shooting you have, the less you should rely on basketball's staple.
But variety is healthy -- and a necessity against playoff defenses. Giannis Antetokounmpo isn't on the court for that play, and Brook Lopez is more dangerous diving to the rim with four shooters around him instead of three. But Antetokounmpo draws a ton of attention wherever he is. He also is Milwaukee's most dangerous roller, and perhaps still underutilized as the ball handler in pick-and-rolls.
A bunch of opponents have defended Antetokounmpo with their centers. It has been nagging at me: Should Milwaukee post Lopez up more when he has a wing on him? They finally went to that well last week against Charlotte (picking mostly on Frank Kaminsky, but still), and Lopez obliterated the Hornets.Editor's PicksLowe: LeBron vs. MJ, this Lakers season and a great NBA what-ifLeBron is headed to the lottery in his first season out West.

LeBron is headed to the lottery in his first season out West. That means something ... but what?
Zach talks to ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz about his Suns feature (3:20), and LeBron and the Lakers likely missing the playoffs (48:43).
The Bucks have scored 1.32 points per possession anytime Lopez shoots from the post, or passes to a teammate who fires off the catch -- the fattest mark among players who have recorded at least 50 post-ups, per Second Spectrum.
Adherence to dogma can sink you in the playoffs. Even Steve Kerr, blessed with insane talent, defaulted to the Stephen Curry-Kevin Durant pick-and-roll when things got tight in the 2017 Finals.
Mike Budenholzer is one of the most brilliant basketball minds alive. He has a vision for how basketball should look. He altered it some to fit a superstar. There will be moments in the playoffs that call for simple, ugly brute force. Budenholzer has to be willing to go there -- and to make tough lineup choices in particular matchups.
I am checking my gut impulse to feel uneasy about Philly. The Sixers are a middling 9-7 in their past 16 games, and it's hard to pin down exactly what they are as they integrate two new stars. Their bench is no bueno.
But their starting five has only played 83 minutes together, and they have smashed opponents. A no bueno bench doesn't matter as much when you stagger those five guys. A healthy Joel Embiid solves a lot of problems. They are balancing competing identities on offense, but it hasn't impacted the bottom line.The Lowe Post podcastESPN's Zach Lowe talks to various basketball people about various basketball things. Listen now!

ESPN's Zach Lowe talks to various basketball people about various basketball things. Listen now!
Philly is betting that there is no such thing as being too big. Given their collective skill level, they are probably right. But quick guards have given them issues, and those get more pronounced when Harris switches onto one. Even regular wings can roast him.
For whatever reason, Harris has always been a strangely upright and inflexible defender. Smaller players just slip right around guys like that.
It's fascinating to watch who Philly chooses to defend point guards. Sometimes it's JJ Redick, but is he up for Kyrie Irving or Kyle Lowry? Sometimes it's Butler. He has been just OK. More often lately, it's Ben Simmons. He gets hung up on screens now and then, and defending point guards takes him away from the rim -- where he's a deterrent.
Maybe it doesn't matter. The Sixers can pound opposing point guards on the other end. But it bears watching.
I'm not sure what happened to Teague in Minnesota, but something in his point guard circuitry went haywire. Maybe he just got a little older. Maybe coaching and roster chaos -- plus a plodding offense that lacked the flowing beauty of his prime Atlanta years -- sapped his rhythm and confidence.
There are long stretches when he barely looks at the rim:
Passing up opens 3s isn't a crime; Teague is an average 3-point shooter. It is often smart to turn down open 3s, call for a second screen, and slither through the crevices that open. It is not smart when you do this:
Teague declines a 3, ignores a wide-open Dario Saric -- shooting 39 percent from deep in Minnesota even though he hasn't quite clicked all the way yet -- and flings up whatever the hell this is.
Teague is on pace for his best assist season. But he's also posting his worst shooting numbers since his rookie year, and there are an astonishing number of games where you barely notice him beyond a few head-scratching decisions.
Saric and Towns make for a snug fit, and every team needs someone like Covington. Jones is a nice backup, though his status as an analytics darling has inflated his reputation. Josh Okogie and Keita Bates-Diop have the vague outlines of solid role players.
But Teague has outlived his usefulness to the franchise, and Andrew Wiggins somehow gets a little worse every season.
For all the losing and angst, how much of long-term import does Minnesota have beyond Towns?
In a league that is almost more melodrama than basketball competition, this dude is an absolute rock. Lillard has never missed more than nine games in a season. He has logged between 35.4 and 36.6 minutes per game for six seasons running. Every damn year, he averages around 26 points and seven assists on 37 percent-ish shooting from deep. He does not have down years.
He gets a little craftier with the ball every season -- more patient reading defenses, and smarter manipulating them.
Lillard waits for the Thunder to reveal their strategy. They want to force him away from Jusuf Nurkic's screen, and pin him on the sideline. Lillard draws them out further, waits until Nurkic blockades Russell Westbrook, and then zooms where he wants to go -- toward the middle, with Steven Adams trailing. From there, it's spin, hesitation dribble, crossover, pull up in your face.LeBron and the LakersThe Lakers' season is close to over. What's next?• Lowe: LeBron vs. MJ implications

The Lakers' season is close to over. What's next?
• Lowe: LeBron vs. MJ implications
• Next three steps for the Lakers
• Will LeBron ever pass Kareem?
• This front office needs a new approach
Lillard wilted against New Orleans' trapping scheme in last season's playoffs. He dissects the Thunder's pressure here with icy calm.
Lillard heads up four of the league's 40 most efficient pick-and-roll combinations, per Second Spectrum. The Blazers have scored 1.12 points per possession when Lillard shoots out of the pick-and-roll or dishes to a teammate who lets fly -- tops among all high-volume ball handlers.
The playoffs will test him again. Right now, Lillard looks ready.
Every trade deadline leaves two or three makeshift teams in its wake: random collections of free-agents-to-be, guys acquired for reasons that are no longer relevant (Trevor Ariza), guys acquired later and for different reasons than the first guy (Bobby Portis, Jabari Parker), and maybe Dwight Howard holding a player option for reasons only Ernie Grunfeld understands. (The Grizzlies have the most fun Flotsam Team.) Everyone is marking time until the season ends.
But these Wiz are fighting, and Satoransky is a joy. Viewed with the wrong perspective, he might leave you wanting. He doesn't run the offense as much as a traditional lead guard. You might not trust his jump shot. Elite point guards and physical scorers give him trouble on the other end.
But Sato just knows how to play. It would be really fun to be on his team. He's unselfish, and a very smart passer. Few guards cut with his sense of timing, and such revved-up urgency:
Some ball handlers disengage when other guys run the show. Satoransky is always searching out little ways he can help, and he sees those opportunities earlier than most. Why stand still or beg for the ball when you can plow away the defense with an improvised screen?
The Wizards have posted a healthy scoring margin for two years running now when Satoransky and Bradley Beal share the floor. Satoransky is shooting 43.5 percent from deep combined over the last two seasons.
Satoransky will be a restricted free agent this summer, and he will have a market. He can play real minutes on a good team.
Four years in, it's still unclear what Mudiay is. Denver conceived of him as a big point guard, but Mudiay has never shown enough playmaking to run a functional NBA offense. He is not really useful off the ball. He seems most comfortable hunting contested midrange shots, and passing up open 3s in annoying prelude:
Some players love catch-and-shoot 20-footers. Some guys make it rain teardrops. Mudiay is the rare bird who prefers tilting 13-foot jumpers, the most midrangy of midrange shots. He's actually pretty good at them! Mudiay is shooting 45 percent on 2s launched between 10 and 16 feet from the hoop, per Basketball-Reference. He's also hit a Nowitzkian 51 percent of long 2s!
Those might be outliers. Mudiay has never been above 36 percent from either range in any prior season. Coincidentally, he has hit almost exactly 36 percent on catch-and-shoot 3s over his past three seasons. So, like, maybe just take those instead of lurching into this kind of vomitous bile:
Even if Mudiay sustains a 40-plus percent hit rate on in-between shots, they are low points-per-play looks that have no place -- beyond late clock bailouts -- on a team actually trying to win.
Quin Snyder once described a smooth, anticipatory player to me as having ""a good nervous system."" I always liked that. (Please ignore that the player was Trey Lyles.)
White has a good nervous system. He is always on his toes on defense, sliding and bouncing, but never out of balance. He moves his feet in almost exact concert with ball handlers, like a mirror image of them.
He can start, stop, and change direction on a dime. He tracks everything at once, so he rotates on time -- with the flight of the ball.
Dallas loves that ""Spain"" action, with Dwight Powell screening for Luka Doncic and Tim Hardaway Jr. lurking in the paint to slam Powell's guy -- LaMarcus Aldridge -- before veering out for an open 3-pointer. A lot of teams coach their two guards -- the guys on Doncic and Hardaway -- to switch.
You almost never see any pair pull it off with the timing and synchronization White and Bryn Forbes show here.
It's tempting to say White plays at his own pace, but we usually attach that phrasing to slower guys. White is explosive in tight spaces. He's good slow and fast. He plays at whatever pace serves him.
It looks like the Mavs have switched when White scoots around this crunchtime pick from Aldridge. White isn't sure. He keeps going, scanning the floor and stutter-stepping side-by-side with Aldridge -- until Powell panics and sinks back inside, revealing the open jumper White suspected might materialize. That is old-man savvy.
White makes simple, correct plays. He passes when he should pass, and launches 3s with confidence when defenses concede them. He often defends the best opposing wing scorer. He has a chance to be really good.
Behold: the most effective pick-and-roll in the league, in all its wackadoo goodness:
The Nuggets have scored 1.35 points per possession when Nikola Jokic shoots after lumbering around a pick from Jamal Murray; Murray launches off a pass from Jokic; or a teammate one pass away finishes the job. That's the best mark among all high-volume combos, per Second Spectrum, and it is not close.
This is a perfectly unorthodox play for Denver's perfectly unorthodox superstar. Jokic's body is not fast. His mind is -- and when he registers that Murray's screen has given him the teensiest edge, he seizes it by putting his shoulder down and nuzzling into inside position.
Go under Murray's pick, and Jokic can set and fire; his 3-pointer has stabilized over the past two months. Help off of any Denver shooter, and Jokic finds him.
Murray is cagey disguising the timing and direction of his picks, and in mixing up what he does afterward. He prefers popping for 3s. Overplay that, and he'll slide into open space and await a dish from Jokic:
Both can abuse switches. That becomes more important in the playoffs, when defenses toggle matchups to make it as painless as possible to switch the opponent's best pick-and-roll combination. It is hard to engineer such switchability against a pick-and-roll involving a team's biggest and smallest guys.
I'm not saying this is the most important story of Detroit's season, but I'm also not saying it isn't: The Pistons have an elaborate three-person opening tip routine in which Blake Griffin and Reggie Jackson mimic volleyball players:
They do this every time Andre Drummond wins the tip, which is almost always, because Drummond is giant and freakishly athletic. He is really the volleyball MVP; you can't develop this level of choreography without a near-guaranteed tip winner who can direct the ball.
(Drummond is 49-15 on opening tips, the best winning percentage among players who have jumped center in more than two games, per the league office. Yes, they looked this up. No, I am not ashamed. I also learned Antetokounmpo is 23-7 in jump balls other than opening tips -- he's 0-of-0 on those -- which is the best percentage of anyone. Brook Lopez is a very solid 47-21 on opening tips, but I am now worried this opening tip controversy I just created could rip apart the Bucks.)
I am almost hesitant to spotlight it, because some anti-fun opponent might instruct its fastest player to rush in and intercept Griffin's set. Couldn't you see Westbrook doing this? Dude blocked Rocky the mountain lion's half-court shot just to be mean. The threat might get in Griffin's head, and impact his set height and accuracy.
The Pistons should go even further. Have Bruce Brown rise up for one of those decoy spikes.
Is this the best tip routine ever? Other nominations?

26245726,"The jersey was acquired by Liu Zhe, a 28-year-old self-proclaimed Kobe fanatic from Harbin, China, in October 2018 after it resurfaced some 6,300 miles from where it was last seen in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. Liu said he purchased it to add to the Kobe collection that he keeps in his home in the capital city of Heilongjiang province.
Liu, who proudly displays his Bryant memorabilia on his Instagram account, said he was contacted by an online seller looking to gauge Liu's interest in the item. Liu told ESPN he paid approximately $2,000 for it, happy to add Bryant's high school No. 33 to his collection full of Los Angeles Lakers uniforms -- both the No. 8 and No. 24 versions -- as well as Bryant's No. 10 USA Basketball jersey.
However, after having the jersey in his possession, Liu said he realized the striking resemblance of his new memento to the framed Bryant jersey that was stolen back in 2017 along with Lower Merion's 1996 PIAA Boys' Basketball 4A State Championship trophy, Bryant's Parade All-American plaque, as well as several game programs and five pairs of Bryant's signature Nike sneakers done up in the Aces' maroon and white color scheme.
Liu had intended to return the uniform to Bryant in person when the former Lakers star visits Shenzhen, China, on Saturday to announce the draw for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.
However, after connecting with a representative for Lower Merion's basketball team through its Instagram account, Liu agreed to mail the uniform back to the school.
He asked for no compensation in return -- other than hoping that Bryant would be alerted that the jersey had been recovered. Adding to the international intrigue of the jersey's jaunt, aiding the translation between Liu and the basketball program was Saiyuan Bian, a professional basketball player in China. Lower Merion head coach Gregg Downer befriended Bian in 2014 when Bian was in the U.S. serving as a translator for the Shanxi Brave Dragons during the Chinese team's preseason training camp held in the Philadelphia area.
""We reached out to Bian and said, 'I think that this guy may be demanding a meeting with Kobe, but maybe it's getting lost in translation,'"" Aces assistant coach Doug Young, who was a teammate of Bryant at Lower Merion, told ESPN. ""So Bian, our friend from China, became kind of the intermediary in all of this.""
Liu, who has already met Bryant a handful of times when the five-time champion made promotional appearances in both China and the United States, said he was motivated to right the wrong because of a note Bryant wrote to him. Liu was named camper of the day at a Bryant-sponsored camp in Los Angeles in 2018. Liu posed with Bryant for a photograph when he received the camp recognition and Bryant autographed the photo of the two of them, adding a personal inscription.
""He signed, 'Dream big! Live epic! Mamba mentality,'"" Liu told ESPN. ""What I did was my 'mamba mentality.'""
The school received the jersey in the mail last week and handed it over to the Lower Merion Police Department. On Tuesday, straight out of an episode of ""Pawn Stars,"" Detective Ed Sarama consulted an area memorabilia shop to verify that the signature on the uniform was authentic. In the opinion of the New Jersey-based shop, it was.
The jersey was not actually worn by Bryant when he scored 2,883 points over his four-year standout stint for Lower Merion from 1992 to '96. The school had 10 replica jerseys made up when the school retired his No. 33 early on in Bryant's career with the Lakers. Bryant signed the 10 jerseys and they were distributed to team boosters and school officials, with one being kept for display purposes.
The fact that the jersey recovered by Liu was manufactured by DeLong only added to Lower Merion officials' belief in its authenticity. DeLong stopped producing basketball uniforms in 2008, according to a customer service representative reached by phone by ESPN this week, and the sporting goods company now focuses its business on letterman jackets and team gear.
The Lower Merion Police Department's investigation is ongoing in hopes of recovering the rest of the stolen items taken on Super Bowl Sunday in February 2017 and bringing the two unidentified thieves caught on security video that night to justice. The LMPD said it has received additional information from Liu about the online seller he purchased the jersey from.
""We'd love to know what happened to the other items too but just the fact that someone, when they realized what they had, was willing to send it back and do the right thing was a very welcome turn of events,"" Young said. ""We're very excited to have the jersey back in its appropriate place.""
Lower Merion plays perennial Philadelphia power Roman Catholic in the PIAA 6A Boys' basketball state playoffs on Wednesday, and Young hopes Bryant's jersey's surprise return was a good omen.
""As coaches, we'd love to think that these kinds of things bring good karma and are harbingers of success,"" he said.
Soon the jersey can once again be appreciated by fans like Liu who make the trek to Lower Merion to see where Bryant's legacy took root.
""I'm sure the Kobe tourists who come to Lower Merion High School to check out the Kobe Bryant Gymnasium and the trophy case will enjoy seeing the jersey again,"" Young said. ""For our school community, it's certainly bigger than that -- we appreciate that someone was generous and willing enough to give us back a little piece of our history.""
Liu says all he wants is for Bryant to know who hooked him up with an assist.
""I hope Kobe can know the news before he comes to China,"" Liu said.

26013649,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Oklahoma City Thunder guard Hamidou Diallo knew he'd have to make an impression to win the slam dunk contest. So he decided to find a way to make the biggest one possible: by dunking over the biggest person in the building.
Wearing a Superman shirt underneath his teal Thunder jersey, Diallo threw down a slam after jumping over 7-foot-1 Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal and then hung on the rim by his elbow to steal the show and come away as the winner of this year's competition.
""Yeah, I was sure,"" Diallo said of whether he knew he could dunk over O'Neal. ""I wouldn't have brought him out there if I wasn't sure.""
Here are the best highlight moments from the skills, 3-point and dunk contests during All-Star Saturday Night.
The 2019 All-Star Game saw Team LeBron rally past Team Giannis at MJ's house. Here's everything you need to know after All-Star Weekend took over Charlotte.
Diallo's dunk was one of the few highlights of a competition that featured some compelling slams -- including New York Knicks guard Dennis Smith Jr. dunking over rapper J. Cole while wearing Cole's high school jersey, and Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins jumping over an airplane prop -- but also lengthy delays because a few contestants required multiple tries in order to complete their dunks.
Two players -- Smith and Charlotte Hornets forward Miles Bridges -- failed to convert one of their attempts.
Smith's failed attempt came on his first dunk in the final round, but he earned a 50 on his second dunk of the final, jumping over Dwyane Wade while getting an alley-oop from Stephen Curry.
Diallo needed at least a 43 on his second dunk of the final to win the title. After pulling rapper Quavo out of the crowd and having him hold the ball over his head, Diallo leaped over him, took the ball out of his hands and slammed it home to score a 45.
As it turns out, Diallo had actually planned on dunking over Wade, his childhood idol, but when Smith used Wade for his dunk, Diallo switched to Quavo.
""It was great,"" Diallo said of winning the competition. ""Dennis stole my third dunk. I was going to use D-Wade last. That was my favorite player growing up. But it all worked out.""
The dunk contest was boring enough that the skills challenge -- typically the least interesting event of the night -- was arguably more compelling.
Jayson Tatum needs a half-court shot to knock off Trae Young in the finals of the skills challenge.
That was thanks to the theatrics of Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum, who fell behind in each of his three rounds -- first to Memphis Grizzlies guard Mike Conley, then to Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic, and finally to Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young -- but rallied to win each and start the night off with a victory.
""No, that was not the plan,"" Tatum said with a smile.
It certainly wasn't his plan to beat Young the way he did -- by throwing in a heave from half court when it appeared Young was all but certain to win.
Tatum said his hope was to at least knock Young's shot away, but he did one better by banking in a shot to edge the Atlanta rookie and earn himself a trophy in the process.
""The previous two rounds the guy was ahead of me, and figured I'd let him get a shot attempt so I'd get closer to the 3-point line,"" Tatum said. ""But I didn't want to give Trae a chance.
""I didn't know I'd make it, but wanted to give myself a chance.""
Tatum's win came on the heels of a 30-point performance in a victory in Friday night's Rising Stars Challenge as part of Team USA.
And Tatum, whose nickname is Taco Jay, said he hopes winning the skills challenge -- which was sponsored by Taco Bell -- might allow him to get one more win out of this weekend.
""I'm going to call Taco Bell tomorrow and tell them I need a deal,"" Tatum said. ""I need to be on the commercial.
""I love tacos.""

26080797,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Further defining his reputation as a dual threat, LeBron James became the first player in league history to rank in the top 10 in both the NBA's all-time assists and scoring lists.
Already ranked No. 5 in all-time points coming into Monday's game against the Memphis Grizzlies, the Los Angeles Lakers star entered into a class of his own by finding Kyle Kuzma for a layup with 6 minutes, 58 seconds remaining in the first quarter to put L.A. up 15-14. It was the 8,525th assist of his career, passing Andre Miller for No. 10 in all-time helpers.
James ended the night with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists -- his 79th career triple-double, which breaks a tie with Wilt Chamberlain for fifth-most in NBA history.
Next up for James is a pair of Hall of Famers who faced off in the 1996 NBA Finals: Michael Jordan and Gary Payton.
Jordan is No. 4 in all-time scoring, with 32,292 points. James ended the night with 32,162 points. Payton is No. 9 on the all-time assists list, with 8,966.

26000356,"Despite recording his 11th-consecutive triple-double Thursday to extend the longest such streak in NBA history, Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook said he still has ""so much room for improvement"" after a 131-122 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans.
On Monday night, Westbrook's triple-double against Portland extended his streak to 10 games, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's mark of nine straight set in 1968.
Westbrook finished with 44 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists in 39 minutes Thursday. In the process, he surpassed Gary Payton for the most points in Thunder/SuperSonics franchise history, with 18,208.
But Westbrook isn't resting on his laurels.
""I have so much room for improvement, just for me personally, because I know how good I can be and how much I can bring to the game and to help this team be successful,"" he said. ""So I'm very, very optimistic.""
Asked where he can improve, Westbrook said: ""Everywhere. Because I do everything.""
It was the 12th time in Westbrook's career where he scored at least 40 points in a triple-double. That puts him in a tie for second place with Houston's James Harden for the most 40-point triple-doubles in NBA history, according to Elias Sports Bureau. Oscar Robertson has the record with 22.
Beyond Westbrook's contributions to the box score, Thunder coach Billy Donovan also praised his point guard for inspiring his teammates on a night when the Thunder didn't have enough ""pop.""
""I thought Russell's energy trying to lift up our team kind of kept us around, kept us hanging around,"" Donovan said. ""He really played downhill; he got to the basket. That was the biggest thing -- you noticed he got to the rim and then he was able to, you know, find people, and he did.
""But I think his energy and his inspiration was just trying to keep the guys in it. Because just calling it like it was, we did not have the pop in my opinion that we needed to have. I think our guys were trying. We didn't have it in some spots tonight, and that's part of it. But I think Russ, as he always does, he was trying to will those guys in timeouts and get our team to fight, and we did.""

26233934,"Toronto Raptors center Serge Ibaka and Cleveland Cavaliers forward Marquese Chriss were ejected from Monday night's game after getting into a physical altercation.
Ibaka went to the floor after the two were battling for position under Cleveland's basket as the Raptors attempted a full-court pass that sailed out of bounds.
Ibaka shoved Chriss from behind and grabbed near his neck before throwing a punch. Chriss responded with a punch before players from both teams separated the two. Ibaka immediately headed for the locker room, and both players were kicked out after the officials conferred.
Cleveland was winning 91-77 at the time of the incident and went on to win 126-101.
Earlier in the game, Ibaka had hit the court hard in the second quarter after being fouled by Chriss following a rebound.
Neither player was available for comment following the game. A Raptors spokesman said Ibaka was reacting to something Chriss said to him after Ibaka was knocked to the floor.
Monday's game marked the eighth ejection of Ibaka's 10-year career and the third for Chriss in three seasons.
The NBA previously suspended Ibaka following altercations with Robin Lopez in 2017 and James Johnson last season. He was suspended one game after both of those cases.
As a repeat offender, Ibaka could be facing a suspension in the range of three to five games, according to ESPN front-office insider Bobby Marks. Ibaka would lose about $149,000 for every game he misses.

26139356,"LOS ANGELES -- With the playoffs seeming like an unrealistic destination for the Los Angeles Lakers following a 113-105 loss to the LA Clippers on Monday night, LeBron James pushed back on the idea of shutting it down for the remainder of the season.
""That would take a lot of convincing from Luke [Walton] on up,"" James told ESPN, referring to the Lakers coach as well as, most likely, everyone from general manager Rob Pelinka, to president Magic Johnson, to governor Jeanie Buss. ""Unless I'm hurt, I'm not sitting games.""
The Lakers are on the verge of missing the playoffs in LeBron James' first season in Los Angeles.
Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma turned his right ankle in the fourth quarter of Monday's game against the Clippers.
Patrick Beverley's tenacity helped set the tone for the Clippers in their win over the reeling Lakers on Monday night. Afterward, he reminded everyone that he had predicted who would be the best team in L.A. at season's end.
Thus far, no one from the Lakers has approached James about sitting out games to preserve his body, or improve their draft lottery odds.
""That conversation hasn't occurred, but I'm sure it can happen soon,"" James told ESPN.
James has played in 46 of the Lakers' 64 games, missing 18 games because of a slight tear in his left groin.
Since his return, as the Lakers tried to chase a postseason berth, he upped his workload, playing 40-plus minutes in five of L.A.'s past eight games.
After his 27 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists in 42 minutes went to waste against the Clippers, James admitted that monitoring his playing time -- if not resting completely -- is a possibility moving forward.
""You kind of look at the rest of the games, and look at the percentages of what's going on there in the future, and see what makes more sense for not only me but the team itself as well,"" James said.

With 18 games remaining, the Lakers (30-34) trail the eighth-place San Antonio Spurs (36-29) by 5½ games for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Spurs also hold the tiebreaker over L.A.
James was asked what motivation the Lakers will have to finish out the season now that the franchise's goal of making the playoffs for the first time in six years seems so remote.
""For me personally, I can [only] speak for myself,"" he said. ""Continue to be a professional, and be as great as you can be every single night, no matter the circumstances. 'Cause someone is always watching.""

26011129,"""The Basketball Africa League is an important next step in our continued development of the game of basketball in Africa,"" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. ""Combined with our other programs on the continent, we are committed to using basketball as an economic engine to create new opportunities in sports, media and technology across Africa.""
The new league, which will be called the Basketball Africa League, or BAL, will be built upon existing team competitions FIBA is already organizing in Africa. It is scheduled to begin play in January 2020.
In order to determine which teams will be participating in the venture, the NBA and FIBA are jointly planning to conduct qualification tournaments later this year to identify the 12 teams that would represent several countries -- including Angola, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia. There will be no more than two teams from any single country in the league.
In addition to the announcement about the creation of the BAL, the NBA introduced two other measures to continue bringing the sport to the continent: by the start of the 2019-20 season, a revamped direct-to-consumer offering of NBA games for fans in Africa, and (along with FIBA) dedicated financial support and resources toward the continued development of the sport on the continent -- including training for players, coaches, referees and infrastructure.

26003330,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- NBA commissioner Adam Silver has opened the annual All-Star Technology Summit by touting the ""smart jersey of the future.""
Silver used an app on a phone to change the number and name on the back of a jersey that was displayed on the side of the stage where he spoke, flipping it from a Kemba Walker model to a Stephen Curry model to a Michael Jordan model. Silver laid out what a fully customizable fan experience may look like in the NBA in 2038, right down to changing the names on the jerseys those fans wear to games.
Silver's address opened the summit, a platform for discussions about basketball's future and the role of evolving technology.
The tech summit is in its 20th year and draws hundreds of top league executives. Panels are scheduled on sports betting, disruptive technology, the relationship between athletes and technology, and ways to attract fans from the so-called Gen Z -- the 2.5 billion people worldwide born between 1997 and 2010.

26273966,"The Utah Jazz have banned a second fan for making offensive comments to Oklahoma City Thunder star Russell Westbrook in 2018, the Deseret News reported.
On Tuesday, the team issued a lifetime ban to fan Shane Keisel for making degrading comments to Westbrook during Monday's game at Vivint Smart Home Arena.
The other incident occurred last season, before Game 4 of the Jazz's first-round playoff series with the Thunder in Utah. In video posted on social media Tuesday, a fan is heard calling Westbrook ""boy.""
Utah Jazz owner Gail Miller addressed the crowd before Thursday's game to underscore the team's willingness to enforce the NBA's code of conduct following Monday's incident involving Russell Westbrook and a fan who crossed the line.
Thunder guard Russell Westbrook declined to share any thoughts Wednesday about the Jazz issuing a lifetime ban to the fan with whom he had a heated exchange during Monday night's game in Utah.
Russell Westbrook said he would rough up a fan and his wife during the Thunder's win in Utah, an exchange caught on video by a reporter and posted to Twitter.
""Don't call me 'boy,'"" Westbrook told the fan, who repeated the phrase. Westbrook then motioned for security personnel.
It is unclear whether the Jazz front office was aware of the incident at the time, but after the video was posted on social media, the team tracked down the fan and gave him a permanent ban, the paper reported.
Before Thursday's game, Jazz owner Gail Miller addressed the crowd to send a message to fans.
""I am extremely disappointed that one of our quote 'fans' conducted himself in such a way as to offend not only a guest in our arena, but also me personally, my family, our organization, the community, our players and you, as the best fans in the NBA,"" Miller said. ""This should never happen. We are not a racist community. We believe in treating people with courtesy and respect as human beings. ... We have a code of conduct in this arena. It will be strictly enforced.""
Video of Westbrook saying, ""I'll f--- you up"" to Keisel during the second quarter of Monday's game went viral after being posted on social media. Westbrook said after the game that it was an emotional reaction to Keisel telling him, ""Get on your knees like you're used to,"" a comment Westbrook considered ""completely disrespectful"" and ""racial.""
The NBA fined Westbrook $25,000 for directing profanity toward a fan. Multiple Jazz players, including franchise cornerstones Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell, publicly supported Westbrook, with Mitchell saying he didn't want Utah to have a negative reputation for athletes who potentially may want to play for the Jazz.

26057708,"TORONTO -- DeMar DeRozan fantasized about the moment 24 hours before while in a roomful of reporters at the Four Seasons hotel, only to live it Friday at a packed Scotiabank Arena that welcomed back the former Toronto Raptor with the standing ovation he envisioned.
Just as fast, the fantasy devolved into a harsh reality for DeRozan, with him committing the turnover that cost the San Antonio Spurs the game with 16.9 seconds remaining in a 120-117 loss that soured his return to Toronto.
""It made it exciting, made it fun to go out there, play and compete,"" DeRozan said of the reception while playing his first game in Toronto since the team traded him, Jakob Poeltl and a protected 2019 first-round pick to San Antonio in July for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. ""It came down to a couple of plays. It sucks that the critical play was me turning the ball over. But for the most part, I think it was a hell of a game.""
Making the dramatic ending juicier was the fact DeRozan committed the turnover at midcourt after a missed Serge Ibaka free throw with San Antonio leading 117-116 and best friend Kyle Lowry guarding him along with Leonard. Leonard poked the ball loose as DeRozan attempted to advance the ball up the court, and then he raced the other way for a dunk to give the Raptors a 118-117 edge with 15.1 seconds remaining.
Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan is past the shock and anger of being traded by Toronto, but his first game back finds him searching within.
""I knew they were trying to be aggressive and trying to make a play on the ball and then foul,"" DeRozan said. ""I've still got to be more aware. I thought I got hit, but I should've just known that they were going to be aggressive. I saw Kyle lurking. In moments like that, you try to get aggressive, try to get a steal first. If not, then you foul regardless. It's on me to be able to look ahead and try to read that.""
DeRozan then failed to capitalize on a potential opportunity to hit the game-winning shot on San Antonio's next trip down the court. With Green guarding, DeRozan raced toward the rim and appeared to have a clear step on the defender. Instead of taking the shot, DeRozan dished to Davis Bertans, who misfired on an off-balance, 14-foot fadeaway shot with 2.8 seconds left.
DeRozan finished the game with 23 points and eight assists in 34 minutes.
""We just grinded away,"" Leonard said. ""Kyle told us we were going to win this game. We all believed that we were, and you know tonight was like a playoff game. We had to grind it out all the way to the end.""
Still, DeRozan would experience the joy of not just one but two standing ovations from a crowd that treated the guard as if he had never left town.
The first occurred during team introductions. The public-address announcer introduced San Antonio's starting lineup, first calling out Rudy Gay, another former Raptor, before introducing DeRozan. Once DeRozan's name was announced, the crowd rose to its feet and let out a roar of applause that lasted for more than 45 seconds. The crowd's standing ovation drowned out the rest of the player introductions.
""It was good for him. He deserved that and more,"" Gay said. ""He did a lot for this city, this organization, and I believe he deserved every bit of cheers that he got.""
Then the arena went dark, with the crowd still standing and applauding DeRozan as officials cued up the team's hype video. The crowd remained standing as Toronto's hype video played on the scoreboard.
DeRozan received more love from the home crowd when he knocked down San Antonio's first bucket of the night with 10:11 left in the opening quarter, after drawing a foul on Ibaka that sent him to the free throw line. DeRozan converted the three-point play, and Raptors fans cheered.
DeRozan's second standing ovation came with 6:52 left in the opening quarter during a timeout with the Spurs trailing 12-10, when Toronto played a tribute video in his honor. The video featured several major moments in DeRozan's career and included footage of the guard with his daughters, moments in NBA All-Star Games, several dunks, candid times with best friend and former teammate Lowry, and highlights from when Toronto advanced to the 2016 Eastern Conference finals.
The arena erupted with applause throughout the video, and the crowd stood throughout the timeout, even after the video closed with a graphic featuring DeRozan's picture that read: ""Thank You DeMar.""
""I think that this was just that last little piece of closure for me,"" DeRozan said. ""Being able to come back here, see familiar faces and get that burden kind of off my shoulders.""
DeRozan briefly walked back onto the court just after the video concluded to acknowledge the crowd then returned to the bench as the fans remained on their feet cheering. DeRozan's second standing ovation lasted just under two minutes, and when the teams returned to the court to resume play, the crowd was still on its feet cheering.
""He was a complete class act, like he always is,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.
At the end of the second ovation, a ""Deebo"" chant broke out and continued for several seconds. DeRozan wasn't the only former Raptor-turned-Spur receiving love from the fans in Toronto.
With 10:06 remaining in the second quarter, the Raptors played a tribute video for Poeltl. While the crowd response wasn't quite as intense, nearly half the arena was standing and cheering for the Raptors' No. 9 overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft.
Selected ninth overall by the Raptors in the 2009 draft, DeRozan spent his first nine seasons in Toronto, becoming the franchise's all-time leader in points (13,296), field goals made (4,716), free throws made (3,539), games played (675) and victories. DeRozan also earned four trips to the NBA All-Star Game (2014, '16, '17, '18) as a Raptor, in addition to being named second-team All-NBA in 2018 and third-team in 2017.
""It's an honor. It's been practically my whole career here,"" DeRozan said. ""To come back and get a reception like that is definitely humbling, beyond gratifying, and I appreciate it. Walking down the floor [after the game] hit me more than anything.""

26261027,"HOUSTON -- DeMarcus Cousins played the best game of his short Golden State Warriors tenure in Wednesday night's 106-104 win over the Houston Rockets.
The big center scored 27 points, grabbed 8 rebounds and dished out 7 assists in a performance he said was the most in rhythm he has felt all season.
""I think we need to remind ourselves that he's still pretty early in the process,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""I don't know how many games he's played for us, 20? We're all learning. Me, too. I got to learn how to use him better. I thought we used him better tonight. I thought he did a phenomenal job just getting down on the block and controlling the game down there. It's a good win for us. We got 15 games left to continue to figure out how to use everybody. The combinations and all of that stuff. This was a good night.""
After being blamed by both fans and media for the Warriors' recent woes, Cousins -- who declined to speak to reporters over the past few days -- brushed off the criticism postgame, acknowledging that he appreciated his teammates publicly defending him.
DeMarcus Cousins ended the Rockets' win streak with his best game of the season. Does this version of Boogie make the Warriors unbeatable?
James Harden said the Rockets' 106-104 defeat to the Warriors was just ""one loss,"" and coach Mike D'Antoni bemoaned too many mistakes and cautioned it must be something that will help Houston in the long run.
Klay Thompson scored 30 points, DeMarcus Cousins had a season-high 27 and the Golden State Warriors snapped Houston's nine-game winning streak Wednesday night with a 106-104 victory over the Rockets.
""I mean, it's cool,"" Cousins said. ""But we've all been in this business long enough to know how it goes. And I've been around this team to know how things go around here. You're always looking for something to make a story about. I mean ... I could care less. I know ... y'all gotta do your job, and I gotta do mine. Y'all looking for a story. It is what it is.""
Cousins compared the season with his new team to being in the middle of a soap opera.
""Oh, it's something every day,"" Cousins said. ""It's like my grandmother -- when I was younger, she had this show she used to watch. I'm sure y'all heard of it -- 'As the World Turns.' She called it her story: 'I gotta watch my story.' I used to watch it with her; and every episode, it was something. That's what this has turned into -- 'As the World Turns.'""
As the Warriors try to chase their third straight NBA championship, both players and coaches have grown tired of some of the questioning they have to deal with on a daily basis, so Warriors forward Draymond Green had no problem agreeing with Cousins' soap opera comparison.
""The NBA is a soap opera in itself,"" Green said with a smile. ""It's probably the best soap opera in the world. If you want to put it in those terms then, yeah, I'm sure it is. Because you got the NBA, which is a soap opera, and then you got this team, which is right in the middle of that entire soap opera. And then he get thrusted into that team that's right in the middle of it. So ... it's interesting.""
On top of Cousins' performance and the ease he had at times down low against the Rockets, the Warriors were just happy to come away with a victory after Sunday night's embarrassing home loss to the Phoenix Suns. Playing without star forward Kevin Durant, who sat out because of an ankle sprain, the Warriors enjoyed one of their best defensive efforts in recent weeks Wednesday, while riding Cousins and a combined 54 points from Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry.
The joy that Kerr wants his team to play with was on display both during and after Wednesday's win as smiles permeated throughout the locker room. Durant proudly waited in the tunnel to greet his teammates and give them a hug on the way back to the locker room.
""It's a good stepping-stone for us,"" Kerr said. ""It's more about the team than it is about any one individual. DeMarcus has had big games for us already. Just figuring out how the game has to feel. It's different with him. We haven't had this kind of an option before. Sometimes we've played a little bit too fast and shot too many quick bad shots, instead of letting him get down on the block and controlling things. We're still learning. This was a really good effort and a good example of how it should look.""
Kerr and his players were happy to see Cousins enjoying the moment against a team they had failed to beat in three previous games this season and one they might face again in the postseason.
""We made a concerted effort to try to feed him in the post because of the way they played defense. He's DeMarcus Cousins,"" Curry said. ""I know he's been through a lot this year and has had some ups and downs since he's been back, but nothing he does out there should surprise anybody. It's just building that consistency, and he's done an amazing job of that, and it's only gonna get better for us.""

26049542,"The NBA has formally proposed changing the draft-eligible age requirement from 19 to 18 to the National Basketball Players Association, USA Today reported Thursday.
USA Today, citing a source, reported that the union and its executive director, Michele Roberts, plan to review the proposal at their post-All-Star break meeting Monday. The timing of the formal proposal is not related to the knee injury suffered by Duke freshman and likely No. 1 overall draft pick Zion Williamson on Wednesday night, according to USA Today.
League sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski in October that the sides had been struggling to reach an agreement on lowering the age requirement.
Despite hurdles, the NBA still hopes to reach an agreement with the NBPA and allow graduating high school seniors to enter the league starting with the 2022 draft.
The G League will offer $125,000 Select Contracts to elite prospects who aren't yet eligible for the NBA but do not want to go the one-and-done route in college.
Commissioner Adam Silver was pressing Roberts to require that player agents furnish all teams with medical information on draft prospects, league sources previously told ESPN. The league also has wanted to mandate players' attendance and some level of participation in the pre-draft combine, sources said.
Agents have long used the leverage of withholding medical information from teams to try to steer players to preferred draft destinations. While it's a strategy that doesn't always render the desired results on draft night, the absence of that medical data creates greater uncertainty and risk for front offices tasked with making personnel decisions on young players.
The union has felt significant pressure from the agent community to resist the NBA's push on ceding control of medical information, sources previously told ESPN.
In tweets on its Inside the NCAA account Friday, the NCAA indicated its support of the reported proposal.
However, the NCAA is encouraged by reports of a recent proposal by the @NBA to @TheNBPA to address draft eligibility age requirements. 18-year-olds should be able to go pro if they don't want to attend college.
The NCAA believes students should have a choice of attending college or playing professionally. The NCAA never had a rule preventing this.
The NBA negotiated to have high school players out of the draft in the 2005 collective bargaining agreement. Under Silver, the NBA has changed course on its thinking regarding early entry.
The league and union must collectively bargain any changes to a CBA that was ratified in 2016.

26173297,"Time for some 10 things (plus a bonus item):
Paul's shooting hasn't come all the way around during the Houston Rockets' climb into the Western Conference's No. 4 spot, but he has his quick-strike swagger back:
What a freaking genius. Look at what Paul sees -- or at least what we can see of Paul's passing angle -- when he slingshots this baby to Eric Gordon:
I mean, come on.
Paul isn't as fast as he once was. He can't blow by defenders -- including big guys on switches -- as easily as he could even last season. He's not a leaper. But when he's healthy, Paul snaps from a standstill into a high-speed lunge with alarming suddenness. He moves in sync with the ball on defense, or even just before the passer releases it. He is almost always anticipatory, not reactive. His brain makes his body faster.Editor's PicksLowe Post: Arnovitz on Suns, Lakers, LeBronZach talks to ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz about his Suns feature (3:20), and LeBron and the Lakers likely missing the playoffs (48:43).Lowe: Khris Middleton is a rare kind of second starHe's an All-Star now, but the Bucks will need an even better version of Middleton to reach their peak with Giannis.1 Related
Zach talks to ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz about his Suns feature (3:20), and LeBron and the Lakers likely missing the playoffs (48:43).
He's an All-Star now, but the Bucks will need an even better version of Middleton to reach their peak with Giannis.
Paul is doing his best work when James Harden rests. The Rockets have outscored opponents by 11 points per 100 possessions in those minutes, and that number has been even beefier -- about 17 points -- since Paul's return from injury in late January. He has a massively positive effect on Houston's wobbly transition defense, a consistent trend through Paul's career, per Cleaning The Glass.
Houston's best lineups haven't quite clicked, even during this streak. The Rockets are about even for the season when Harden and Paul share the floor, and their starting group -- Paul, Harden, Gordon, the indomitable PJ Tucker and Clint Capela -- has been a net negative.
That will change if Paul keeps playing this way.
A stat that might surprise: The Utah Jazz have destroyed opponents by about 14 points per 100 possessions when Ingles and Favors play without all three of Ricky Rubio, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, per NBA.com. Ingles has become Utah's de facto backup point guard, and he and Favors have developed a nimble chemistry in the pick-and-roll:
Favors is cagey disguising the direction of his screen. Ingles flips from fast to slow -- or perhaps slow to less slow -- depending on how much time Favors needs to roll deep into the paint, or what tactic would crack open the widest passing lane:
Both can hit floaters or midrange jumpers. Ingles keeps help defenders guessing until the very last second. He has a fake for every part of his body -- eye fakes, pump fakes, and the meanest pass fake since Manu Ginobili was spinning big guys around like tops. It wouldn't surprise me if Ingles has some sort of nose fake we don't know about.
Is this a layup or a pass?
By the time you realize, it's already over.
Favors, meanwhile, is enjoying perhaps his best two-way season. He has canned 64 percent of his 2-pointers. He is healthy and cramming on fools again. Opponents have hit just 48.6 percent of their shots at the rim with Favors nearby, the lowest such figure among 151 players who challenge at least two such shots per game.
Zoom out farther, and opponents have an effective field-goal mark 9.2 percentage points lower than expected -- based on the location of each shot -- when Favors is the nearest defender, the stingiest figure among all rotation players, per Second Spectrum tracking data. Yowza.
The Favors-Gobert combo might not work over heavy minutes, or in crunch time, but Favors is essential to the Jazz anyway (for now). The Ingles/Kyle Korver/Royce O'Neale/Jae Crowder/Favors group has become a fixture of Quin Snyder's rotation.
After falling to the fringes of the Miami Heat's rotation, Olynyk has re-emerged as a crucial cog and starter as the capped-out Heat try to salvage a third straight blah season. The king of the slow-motion pump-and-drive is averaging 15 points since Feb. 1 on 54 percent shooting -- including 47 percent from deep.
The Heat have outscored opponents by about five points per 100 possessions when Olynyk and Bam Adebayo -- their current starting big-man duo -- share the floor, and even the maligned Olynyk-Hassan Whiteside pairing has surged over the past month. Olynyk is a heady sort, and he's doing his best to chase opposing power forwards on defense so Adebayo and Whiteside can hang near the rim.
With Goran Dragic hurting and Wayne Ellington a tax casualty, the Heat sorely need the threat of Olynyk's jump shot to stress defenses. He's also delightfully patient around the rim, holding his pivot foot and staying low as shot-blockers fly around him -- and using all three seconds of allotted paint time:
He's like Little Mac in there dodging punches until it's safe to strike.
The Heat are only 6-7 since reinserting Olynyk into the starting lineup, but he has helped them stay afloat amid injuries. Olynyk has cracked the 20-point barrier in four of Miami's past six games, including recent wins over Brooklyn and Charlotte with huge playoff implications.
We hearty souls who have been foraging atop Julius Randle Hill for years always knew he could score, trample entire defenses on the fast break, and dish canny assists when he wasn't getting a little hoggy. It has been nice seeing him flourish as a 20-point scorer with the New Orleans Pelicans.
But there is some trepidation in the Hill community -- more populous now -- given that Randle's ascension on offense has come at the expense of his work on the other end. Some of that is New Orleans shoehorning Randle into defending stretchy power forwards. He just does not have the fast-twitch speed or attention to detail for it:
He is often late dipping into the paint to help, meaning he is also late darting back out:
Randle is still moving toward the paint when Avery Bradley's pass to Danilo Gallinari is airborne in the other direction. That is death.
Randle hasn't fared much better protecting the rim. He is 451st among 494 players in the defense-only version of ESPN's real plus-minus -- a stat that often makes big men appear better than they are (hi, DeAndre Jordan.) He is dead last among centers.
We will not lose hope! Randle's numbers defending the pick-and-roll are fine, per Second Spectrum. When Randle digs in, he can be a deterrent at the rim and (kinda) switch across all five positions. He is probably best suited as a switchable small-ball center, but building a roster in which he can play that role as a starter will be tough.
The only thing that really matters from Doncic's sensational rookie season is Doncic proving he can already run a good offense. He is a passing savant with a jump shot and preternatural footwork.
He will become a decent defender, and perhaps even a very good one, as he gets in better shape. He's big and smart -- a good rebounder who already locks in during crunch time.
But in Year 2, Doncic needs to tighten up his off-ball work:
He has a tendency to get lost in no-man's land -- to turn his back on shooters, and dither into help position without actually helping anyone.
There is no point crashing the paint on the pick-and-roll if you do it late, at half-speed, and give the opposing big man a love tap:
Doncic's positional versatility has been more shield than sword on defense; it gives Dallas more flexibility hiding him on non-threatening players as if he's a late-career Lakers star.
Doncic will be fine on defense, and he's already a stud on the other end. Reminder: He gets to play with Kristaps Porzingis next season!
A little guy busting out a long-distance up-and-under is one of the coolest, most relatable NBA things:
Go to work, D.J. Augustin! That is a normal person driveway move. That is a move you use when you can't blow by anyone, and I say that from personal experience. (If the defender stays down, I'll need some help, please.)
Jayson Tatum isn't a little guy, but that just means he can traverse longer distances with a single pivot move:
(As a Tatum-related aside, I like this lineup for the Boston Celtics: Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Tatum and Aron Baynes/Daniel Theis. The Baynes version has killed it so far. The Celtics should never rest Tatum, Kyrie Irving and Al Horford at the same time. Such lineups don't have quite enough shooting. If Irving and Horford are on the bench, Tatum should be on the floor.)
We think of the up-and-under as a post move. Kevin McHale, of course, is the all-time master. It's fun to see perimeter guys improvise with it farther from the hoop.
Andrew Wiggins is the current captain of the ""It's Just Not Happening"" team, but Minnesota Timberwolves fans have been through enough.
Chriss has somehow regressed in Year 3, and playing real minutes with the Cleveland Cavaliers has made things worse. I'm not sure there is any player more out of sorts on offense. He's shooting 28 percent on 3-pointers and 46 percent on 2-pointers. His fouls and turnovers have spiked in the manner of someone who is still a beat behind processing the game.
The Suns eased Chriss into some playmaking duty from the elbows, and at times, he looked comfortable there. Not now. He commits illegal screens on handoffs, and throws passes that are too late or off-target:
He just runs into dudes in traffic:
Help defenders seem to surprise him. He doesn't have a Plan B. Perhaps most distressing: Chriss travels a lot -- in the post, when he tries to pump-and-drive, even just triggering run-of-the-mill dribble moves.
Chriss should be an NBA player. Let's hope he finds a stable path there.
Man, some of these refs have short fuses. On Sunday, Trae Young was tossed for staring down Kris Dunn after canning a triple. Nine days earlier in Atlanta, officials ejected Blake Griffin after two weak technicals -- the second of which came when Griffin yapped at the Hawks bench after drilling a sideline 3-pointer.LeBron and the LakersThe Lakers' season is close to over.

The Lakers' season is close to over. What's next?
• Lowe: LeBron vs. MJ implications
• Next three steps for the Lakers
• Will LeBron ever pass Kareem?
• This front office needs a new approach
This season has featured quick-trigger technicals against Lance Stephenson for strumming his air guitar after a 3-pointer that put the Lakers up 32 points in Charlotte; and against Clint Capela for a very quick swing on the rim.
The Young and Stephenson techs show the lingering influence of the Malice at the Palace. The league understandably fears late-game taunting in blowouts -- the kind of rubbing-it-in-the-face that might infuriate a frustrated player on the trailing team. Ditto for staredowns between players who have already been warned about tense encounters -- as Young and Dunn were Sunday.
But can we chill a little with second technicals? The league is lucky Detroit rallied to win in Atlanta without Griffin. The Pistons are leading a semi-heated playoff race. Every game matters. Griffin is their best player. You can't eject him from a late-season game for talking trash.
If we are going to needle refs for being against fun, we should also acknowledge that the league has eradicated Hack-a-Shaq. There have been only 33 intentional away-from-the-play fouls this season, putting the league on pace for about 45 such hacks -- down from 77 last season, 126 the year before, and an unwatchable 420 in 2015-16, per league figures released to ESPN.com.
After that season, the league extended the harsh late-game penalties for such fouls -- one free throw and the ball -- over the last two minutes of every quarter. Meanwhile, the league's two main Hack-a targets -- Andre Drummond and DeAndre Jordan -- have improved their free throw shooting to the point that the strategy no longer makes sense against them. Two other candidates -- Dwight Howard and Andre Roberson -- have been injured all or most of this season.The BoardroomExecutive produced by Kevin Durant, The Boardroom explores the most fascinating trends and innovative endeavors across the business of sports, featuring conversations with athletes, executives and business titans.

Lonzo Ball -- shooting a preposterous 41.7 percent on free throws -- is hurt, too. Downturns for D.J. Wilson (11-of-28), OG Anunoby (21-of-44) and Steven Adams (53 percent) are probably random. That leaves one guy to monitor: Hassan Whiteside, shooting 44 percent after hitting at least 60 percent in each of the past three seasons. If he stabilizes, we might be in the Hack-a-Shaq clear until Roberson returns.
Next up: banning the clotheslines and wrap-ups that abort fast breaks.
This guy is either super-committed to his job, or a little reckless -- or both.
If D'Angelo Russell throws a bounce pass to Rodions Kurucs, our mopper -- belly-flopping into a double-towel breaststroke -- might accidentally intercept it. Our guy loves his area of the floor. He dotes on it like Kramer picking up trash along his highway mile. He will risk bodily harm to keep his territory pristine.
The best mopper-related drama happens when they venture farther onto the floor with actual mops during live action, and the offensive team coughs the ball up -- leading to a fast break coming right at the poor court-wipers. They have to pick up those mops and rush back to the baseline. You can see the terror in their eyes.
So much of good defense lives in the absence of anything happening. Witness these six seconds of nothing -- but everything -- from George:
He navigates a Nikola Jokic screen untouched, and then blocks the passing lane between Jokic and Malik Beasley. Jokic nudges past Steven Adams, but George lingers in the lane to stop him. Perhaps he has strayed too far, and stayed too long. Jokic pings the ball to Beasley in the corner. George is already moving there before the ball is out of Jokic's hands, and he's fast enough and long enough to get back to Beasley.The Lowe Post podcastESPN's Zach Lowe talks to various basketball people about various basketball things.

It can appear as if George is cavalier with shooters -- as if he has left them too open. But it's really that he knows exactly how much time his length and athleticism buy him, and how to exploit every millisecond of that time.
George closes out on Beasley without losing his balance, or flying by him. Beasley has nothing. Denver starts from scratch.
George will never challenge as many raw shot attempts as the big men jostling with him for Defensive Player of the Year. That is inherent in the positional differences between wings and bigs. But you wonder how much sequences like these define what kinds of shots those big men end up challenging -- who shoots them, from where, and under what level of pressure from both the defense and the shot clock.

26123234,"""It's all about long-term preservation and making sure I'm ready not just for the playoffs, but also for the next 15 years,"" Embiid said before Saturday night's game at Wells Fargo Center. ""Knowing the team, what we've been through, and knowing me and I like to push everything, I like to play through anything. We just felt like it was better to preserve.
""I didn't feel good, but it's getting better.""
Initially reticent to give a specific time frame for his return, Embiid eventually relented and said -- after saying he'd be back ""soon"" several times -- that he plans to return sometime next week.
Philadelphia hopes first win in Oklahoma City sparks another process: jelling in time for the playoffs.
He also said multiple times that if he had to, he could play now, but that there's little need to push things given Philadelphia's comfortable positioning in the middle of the East standings.
Embiid had been playing through both back and knee soreness leading up to the All-Star Break and was a starter in this year's All-Star Game in Charlotte. But after feeling some discomfort in his left knee, Embiid underwent an MRI, which came back clean.
""Game by game, I felt like it was getting worse,"" Embiid said. ""I felt like me, personally, I didn't feel comfortable. Coming from me you know that if I don't want to push through anything, I really need [the rest].
""But I'm glad it was nothing, and the MRIs showed nothing, so it was good.""
Still, the decision was made to give him some rest to allow the tendinitis in his knee to dissipate and get him into the best place possible physically before Philadelphia reaches the playoffs.
And while he has fought such resting situations in the past, Embiid added he has begun to learn to trust what he's told when it comes to rest during the year.
""Right now it's all about preserving, all about the playoffs,"" he said. ""I've said it in the past, but I've matured a lot. I've learned not to fight on stupid stuff. If the team wants me to rest, I'll listen, and if I feel good, I'll play. But if I need some rest, at the end of the day, it's all about being healthy. I understand it.
""They've got my back, and I've got theirs ... if I felt like my teammates needed me, the coaches needed me really bad, I would feel compelled to play. But right now, with the knee and with the guys we've added, it's also good to learn how to play without me; I actually think it benefits us, and I am excited to come back and fit in.""
Embiid was asked why he played in the All-Star Game. He insisted he felt good enough to play in Charlotte.
""It wasn't bothering me,"" he said. ""I just felt like every game, going into every game, I was good. All-Star Game, I was good. It had nothing to do with playing in the All-Star Game. Nothing was bothering me. But after that, I just felt like with us being in a great position to make the playoffs, and at the end of the day, it's about making sure I'm good for the rest of my career and these playoffs.
""We just felt like it was best to make sure I was good.""
In addition to giving an update on his health, Embiid also used his pregame news conference as an opportunity to trade compliments with Kevin Durant. Saturday morning, Durant said after Golden State's shootaround that Embiid is the best center in the NBA.
""Joel Embiid is by far the toughest center to stop in the league,"" Durant said. ""You can get a bucket anytime or just get a good shot anytime you throw it to him.""
Embiid, after thanking Durant (through the reporter who apprised him of the remark), then said Durant is the best player in the game today.
""We beat them in the first game [last month in Oakland], so I was excited to play in that game, which I did,"" Embiid said with a smile. ""It's always great to play against guys like him. At this point, he's probably the best player in the league, to me. It's always great to measure yourself against the best, and those guys are the champs and you want to go against them. It was great to get a win earlier in the season, although they didn't have Klay [Thompson], but since then, we've gotten better.
""I'm bummed to miss this game, but I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunities. We've got a couple of good teams in our conference like Toronto, Milwaukee or Boston where we can really measure ourselves and see where we are.""

26260210,"HOUSTON -- No regular-season game means all that much for a couple of rivals that played seven games in the Western Conference finals last season.
So nobody wanted to jump to any grand conclusions after the Golden State Warriors held on for a 106-104 win Wednesday over the Houston Rockets, a team that has established itself over the past two seasons as the two-time defending champions' primary challengers.
""We didn't learn nothing that we didn't already know,"" guard Chris Paul said after the Rockets' nine-game winning streak was snapped and any realistic hope of catching the Warriors for the West's top seed was extinguished. ""We done played them enough times where they know us, and we know them.""
There is, however, a 6-foot-11, 270-pound wild card in the equation that wasn't around for the West finals last year. Nor was DeMarcus Cousins available for the Warriors' first two meetings against the Rockets this season, while he was still recovering from the torn Achilles tendon that made it possible for Golden State to add an All-Star big man for the taxpayer's exception. And he was a liability in the Warriors' Feb. 23 loss to the Rockets, a nonfactor offensively and picked on defensively.
DeMarcus Cousins scored 27 points and had 8 rebounds and 7 assists in a performance he said was the most in rhythm he has felt all season with Golden State.
Golden State is in first place in the Western Conference and still the favorite to win a third consecutive NBA title. So why has this season been anything but golden for the Warriors?
But the version of Cousins that showed up to the Toyota Center on Wednesday is capable of altering the dynamic of a playoff series, particularly against the undersized Rockets. This was by far the best ""Boogie"" has been for the Warriors, setting season highs with 27 points and seven assists, repeatedly bullying the Rockets on the block.
In short, Cousins was as dominant as he has been since before his injury, which he suffered in the final minute of a triple-double performance last January in which he helped the New Orleans Pelicans hand Houston its first loss when the Rockets' star trio -- Paul, James Harden and Clint Capela -- was all healthy.
""He just played probably the most complete game since he's been here,"" said Klay Thompson, whose 30 points included three layups and a 3-pointer off feeds from Cousins. ""I mean, I was getting wide-open looks from his passing ability. He adds a whole new dimension to our team.
""You saw what he can do with us tonight.""
When Cousins settled for a one-year deal with Golden State, a lot of folks figured he could be a solution to the Rockets' switch-intensive defensive scheme that often baited the Warriors into relying on isolation instead of their typically beautiful ball movement. Good luck asking a guard to keep Cousins from feasting in the paint.
But the Rockets have scrapped much of their switching due to different personnel. Cousins did the majority of his damage Wednesday against Capela, but Houston's center didn't seem too concerned after the Warriors' lone win over the Rockets this season.
""For us, he's not the main focus because we are really trying to take away 3s and make them score in the paint,"" Capela said. ""So [he] did a good job and I'm not worried about that.""
Nor was Houston coach Mike D'Antoni, saying, ""Cousins will get what Cousins gets."" D'Antoni also mentioned that physical Rockets reserve center Nene would hopefully be able to help make it tougher for Cousins to dominate down low, which made the decision to rest Nene on Wednesday a bit curious.
""I don't think anybody can stop me 1-on-1, period,"" said Cousins, who was 11-of-16 from the field. ""You can put whoever you want on me, honestly.""
Cousins clearly wasn't a focal point of the Rockets' defensive game plan even with Kevin Durant out because of a sprained right ankle. For Cousins, that's kind of the beauty of blending in with a team that has arguably as much offensive firepower as any in NBA history.
The downside to that: Cousins has often been an offensive afterthought in the nearly two months he has been playing for the Warriors, as they've struggled to find ways to feature the kind of low-post weapon they've never had.
""We've all got to learn -- me, too,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""I've got to learn how to use him better. I thought we used him better tonight. He did a phenomenal job of just getting down on the block and controlling the game down there.""
According to Second Spectrum, the Warriors got Cousins the ball on 18 post-ups, the second most by any player during Kerr's five seasons. He had 64 total touches, creating 43 points -- the 0.67 points created per touch was Cousins' best in any game over the past two seasons.
The Warriors' offense hummed using Cousins as a hub with an offensive rating of 118.3 in his 32 minutes. And Houston wasn't able to pick on Cousins on the other end (104.9 defensive rating), as he spent much of the night hiding on PJ Tucker.
""Tonight was a good step,"" Warriors star Stephen Curry said, speaking specifically about Cousins. ""It's obviously the regular season and a lot more work to do, but I think the way he played the entire minutes he was out there, you knew where No. 0 is at all times.""
And, unlike when the Warriors last saw the Rockets, you could envision Cousins being a force if the rivals meet again in May.

26275130,"Green's comments came in the wake of an incident during Monday's game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Utah Jazz in which Thunder guard Russell Westbrook and a fan exchanged words. Westbrook was fined $25,000 for directing profanity toward the fan, who was banned for life from Vivint Smart Home Arena in Salt Lake City.
When asked how frequently fans cross the line of proper conduct, Green was quick with an answer.
""Often,"" Green said after Friday's practice. ""A lot. It's crazy. I guess it's just the nature of what we do, I guess. I don't really understand why grown men get off by coming into someone else's job and saying bulls---. I guess that's their way of letting out frustration in their life, but it's kind of stupid to me.""
Green, now in his seventh NBA season, believes fans' treatment of players has gotten worse over time.
The Utah Jazz have banned a second fan for making offensive comments to Oklahoma City star Russell Westbrook. In video posted on social media, the fan calls Westbrook ""boy.""
Utah Jazz owner Gail Miller addressed the crowd before Thursday's game to underscore the team's willingness to enforce the NBA's code of conduct following Monday's incident involving Russell Westbrook and a fan who crossed the line.
Thunder guard Russell Westbrook declined to share any thoughts Wednesday about the Jazz issuing a lifetime ban to the fan with whom he had a heated exchange during Monday night's game in Utah.
""Because our penalties get worse,"" Green said. ""So if I'm like someone who's probably not as happy with my life and I've got an opportunity, where I'm going to someone else's place of employment and I know if I say something crazy to them and they say something back they lose money, misery loves company. So I think our penalties are raised and blasted to the world, people will keep doing that. Because at the end of the day, what do they really lose? But our families lose money out of our [pockets] that we provide. I think as long as that happens, [fans] will continue to do it. It is what is, I guess.""
Green's comments come on the same day the Deseret News reported that the Jazz banned a second fan for comments made toward Westbrook last year. Green reiterated that he doesn't think anything will change as long as the league continues fining players like Westbrook for defending themselves.
""Like I said, I think as long as the league continues to fine players for saying something back when there are people completely disrespecting [them], it will always happen,"" Green said.

26131924,"The first time Gordon Hayward settled into an armchair to watch early film of his 2018-19 season, he was stunned. Who was that guy moving as though he were knee-deep in a vat of molasses?
""I was thinking, 'Wow, am I really that slow out there?'"" Hayward admitted. ""I think it's hard in general to watch yourself on film, but obviously, this was on another level.""
Boston Celtics assistant coach Scott Morrison, who has been working one-on-one with Hayward since he signed his four-year, $128 million deal in the summer of 2017, waited until early January to provide Hayward with a visual of what he needed to take the next step forward:
""Hang on the rim"" (get to the basket more)
""Get in your bag"" (try more creative shots, such as his teardrop floater)
""Use your claws"" (be more aggressive)
Morrison found positive evidence of each of these traits from Hayward's days with the Utah Jazz, then spliced them next to examples of a more hesitant Hayward in a Boston uniform.
""I wasn't sure how he'd react,"" Morrison said. ""Gordon's a thinker. He's watching all those clips, the good and the bad, and he's focusing on the bad.""
Perhaps it would be easier for Hayward if he were not a high-profile athlete with a high-profile salary to match, donning the jersey of the most decorated team in NBA history. Perhaps too the scrutiny would not be so intense if his Celtics hadn't struggled so mightily this season, slogging through in fits and starts, one step forward, one step back.
Hayward has come to symbolize those struggles.
He is attempting to corral his new basketball life on a glaringly naked public stage. The injury he incurred last season, a foot so gruesomely distorted that his teammates had to turn away, continues to bedevil him, both physically and mentally, even as he diligently works to put it behind him.
That recovery process, Hayward told ESPN, includes the assistance of a mental health counselor to help navigate the mental gymnastics of returning to ""normal"" -- whatever that means. Working with the counselor to navigate those gymnastics has been a major step in Hayward's healing that he concedes took some time for him to reconcile.
""It's hard,"" Hayward said. ""It's embarrassing. You want to be the guy that says, 'I'm strong. I don't need any help.'""
During his most discouraging days, Hayward recalls what Paul George confided to him: It took two full years before he could play freely, without residue of his own catastrophic open tibia fracture from 2014.
""Patience,"" George counseled Hayward. ""Focus on who you are, not who you used to be.""
That has been easier said than done. With each encouraging performance, such as Hayward's Jan. 2 explosion against Minnesota, in which he submitted 35 points on 14-of-18 shooting, there's a clunker that follows, such as the three-point, one-assist effort against Brooklyn 12 days later. Hayward strung together three aggressive games just before the All-Star break, but then he sprained his ankle during a workout, and he has been scuffling again his past five games.
Following a win over the Washington Wizards on Friday, in which Hayward took just two shots and missed both, a fan stomped through TD Garden chanting, ""Trade Gordon Hayward -- for a bag of balls!""
The backlash from impatient fans comes up in Hayward's mental health sessions. ""The people helping me are aware of the noise,"" he said.
His mind is calmer now that the mental health counselor advised him to eschew platforms such as Twitter and Instagram.
Boston sits in fifth place in the Eastern Conference. The results have been disappointing; the team was betting that the returns of Kyrie Irving and Hayward would vault Boston to the top of the standings. Instead, the team has been maddeningly inconsistent.
Asked what has been the most vexing component of his uneven season, Hayward answered, ""The most frustrating part is that I'm constantly being asked if I'm 'back.'
""Back to what? Because the situation is completely different now.""
In 2016-17, Hayward's first (and only) All-Star season, he averaged 21.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game for the Jazz. He was their star, took nearly 16 shots a game, drove to the basket with great confidence, shot 40 percent from the 3-point line and went to the free throw line nearly six times a night.
This season, he averages 2.4 trips to the free throw line, a byproduct of the mistrust in his own body. His assists are down, though Boston's analytics staff is quick to point out that he has been prolific with the so-called ""hockey assist,"" a ball-movement stat that doesn't show up in the box score.
""Even if I was fully healthy, there would be nights, production-wise, where the numbers just aren't going to be there,"" Hayward said. ""Somebody gets hot or I'm not shooting well, and we go in a different direction, and that's how it's going to be. And that's never happened to me before.
""When it does happen, it's like, 'Oh, physically he's not there yet.' In my mind, I'm saying, 'No, no, I'm fine. The opportunities just weren't there.'""
He's right, of course.
Boston has Irving, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Jaylen Brown vying for shots. They make up an offense that is predicated on sharing the ball, with the lone exception of Irving, the designated alpha who creates his own offense.
Still, because the Celtics considered Hayward a key cog in their championship aspirations, they determined that the best way to help him rehab was to let him work out the kinks on the court. It was a strategy that backfired miserably. As Hayward faltered early in the season, his play became stilted, hesitant. His teammates observed this, some from the bench, and chafed at their own lack of opportunity.
""I never felt like guys were frustrated with me,"" Hayward said, ""but you could feel that guys were frustrated with their situation. Everyone in the NBA wants a bigger role. It was tough on everybody. We were trying to win basketball games, but at the same time, I was trying to get back to being the player I was, and some of that involved getting reps.""
Hayward's difficulties were compounded by back woes stemming from atrophied muscles that had not been fired for nearly a year. He received injections to ease the pain, but it further limited his mobility -- and further delayed his progress.
""We never felt, 'This isn't going to work -- get him out of here,'"" teammate Marcus Smart explained. ""It was more, 'We're rushing him.' Everyone wanted to throw Gordon back out there, but his body wasn't ready to do what we were asking him to do.""
Smart said the players understand the quandary: They need a healthy and confident Hayward to win the East, but force-feeding him minutes was impeding the team's day-to-day success.
""It's complicated,"" Smart conceded. ""You can't stop playing him, but at the same time, you don't want to lose the other guys who are playing well. Guys need to earn their minutes.
""Gordon understands that. We want Gordon to be Gordon. We need that confident guy.""
Celtics coach Brad Stevens says now that he managed Hayward's return incorrectly. It was too much, too soon, and Stevens made the move to relegate his former prized college recruit to the bench on Nov. 19 after Boston's lackluster 9-7 start.
""The one thing we haven't done all year is talk about what Gordon can't do,"" Stevens said. ""We talk about what he does well and try to put him in the best position to do that.
""We didn't do a great job of that early on. And I think we've all learned how he can best help us. When he plays with the ball, he makes the right play over and over and over.""
Jayson Tatum has a team-high 19 points to go with Gordon Hayward's 18 to lead a Kyrie Irving-less Celtics to a 118-110 win over the Pistons.
During an early-season plane trip, a group of players wanted to roll dice. Hayward wasn't interested in playing, so he offered to switch seats. He wound up next to Tatum, the silky 21-year-old who is in a hurry to be great. The two got to talking, not about basketball but about parenthood and food and music. Hayward teased Tatum that he was still just a baby and started calling him Little Bro. That blossoming friendship, Hayward said, can only help their relationship on the court.
""Of all the guys in here, [Hayward is] one of the last guys I expected to be hanging with,"" Tatum admitted, ""but it's happened. We talk about everything on those plane rides.""
Hayward explained how his injury affected his time with his teammates.
""One of the hardest things about last year was going through the whole injury kind of alone,"" he said. ""It wasn't necessarily anyone's fault. I had just moved to a new team and was just starting to try and develop relationships with these guys. Then I got hurt, and I was away from the team, and you don't have a chance to put a foundation down.""
Veteran big man Aron Baynes was the first to show up at Hayward's door, with Hayward's beloved glazed doughnuts under his arm. Over time, Baynes, Horford and Daniel Theis, all of whom have young children, became regulars at the Hayward house, providing welcome chaos and camaraderie. Hayward has three young daughters -- 3½-year-old Bernie, 2½-year-old Charlotte (whom they call Charlie) and baby Nora -- and the kids are a welcome respite from the pressures of his job.
""The girls don't care if I have 40 or four points,"" Hayward said. ""All they know is I play basketball with my friends. They don't even know it's the Celtics. To them it's the green team.""
The dysfunction of the Celtics team has been well documented, and there was no more public evidence than when Irving berated Hayward in the closing seconds of a Jan. 12 loss at the Orlando Magic for passing the ball to Tatum for an open shot in the corner instead of waiting for a Horford screen designed to get Irving free.
Tatum missed.
The Celtics still haven't established consistency as the playoffs near.
• Celtics are running out of time
• Celtics owner: Worst Feb. in memory
• Durant: Celtics will be fine in playoffs
• MacMullan: Still waiting on Hayward
""[Kyrie] wanted to have the ball, and he wanted to have the last shot, and I felt there wasn't enough time to get that play off,"" Hayward said. ""Coach Stevens was saying, 'Look at Tatum. Look at Tatum.' I think by the end of Jayson's career, he's going to make a ton of shots like that.
""It didn't really bother me. Kyrie called me later that night and apologized. I knew it was in the moment.""
It has all been part of Hayward's discovering where he fits amid Irving's own funk, which has affected the play of the team in recent weeks.
Hayward knows anxious fans are counting down the days to the postseason, wondering what version of Gordon Hayward will be available. He said he can no longer think like that.
""I can't worry about numbers,"" he said. ""I've got to focus on winning plays.""
But those who pine for the days of Utah Hayward, Morrison cautioned, are going to be disappointed.
""Talent-wise, skill-wise, he can be better than he was -- and I hope he is,'' Morrison said. ""But it's not going to look the same. So I hope people don't compare his stat line in Utah to this year or next year. Instead, watch how he impacts the game.''
Hayward reported that he feels more comfortable driving into the teeth of the defense and exploding off his leg. He is finally challenging bigs again and absorbing contact. His ankle is still not pain-free, but the soreness is both predictable and treatable with ice and Ibuprofen.
""I'm fine,"" he said.
"
26275235,"""He probably will not be here on this road trip,"" coach Steve Kerr said after Friday's practice. ""I think he gets to the Bay on Saturday. So I didn't think it made sense for him to fly across the country after flying across the world, so he'll probably just meet us in the Bay when we get back, more than likely.""
Bogut, 34, signed with the Warriors last week after finishing his season in the National Basketball League in Australia. Kerr said Bogut got all his visa issues worked out and will be ready to start practicing as soon as the Warriors return from their current four-game road trip. This will mark the beginning of Bogut's second stint with the organization. He spent four seasons with the Warriors and won an NBA title in 2015.
DeMarcus Cousins scored 27 points and had 8 rebounds and 7 assists in a performance he said was the most in rhythm he has felt all season with Golden State.
In the short term, Kerr is hopeful that star forward Kevin Durant will return Saturday against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Durant, who missed Wednesday's win over the Houston Rockets after spraining his right ankle in Sunday's loss to the Phoenix Suns, went through all of Friday's practice and will be re-evaluated by Dr. Rick Celebrini, the Warriors' director of sports medicine and performance.
""We'll see,"" Kerr said of Durant's status. ""He practiced today and he's feeling better, but I would list him as questionable still. We'll see. He's going to do some more work with Rick, and Rick will make the determination [Saturday] probably at shootaround.""

26100272,"The Pelicans waived guard Tim Frazier on Wednesday night after a loss at the Los Angeles Lakers, making available a roster spot for Bertans, league sources said.
This would be the first significant roster move under interim general manager Danny Ferry, who recently replaced Dell Demps. Bertans, 29, is the older brother of San Antonio Spurs forward Davis Bertans.
Dairis Bertans is under contract with Italian team Olimpia Milano and is leading the Euroleague in 3-point shooting at 54 percent. He has an out-clause for the NBA that would allow him to join the Pelicans upon passing a physical and receiving his letter of clearance from FIBA.
Bertans has represented his home country of Latvia at several stages of the FIBA level, including the U16, U18 and U20 European Championships, with numerous appearances for the senior national team in recent years. He would be the fourth player from Latvia (population 1.9 million) in the NBA, including Dallas Mavericks star Kristaps Porzingis.
Bertans is a career 47 percent 3-point shooter in more than 80 Euroleague appearances.

26048666,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State Warriors big man DeMarcus Cousins has strong feelings regarding college basketball and the NCAA's system in the wake of the knee injury suffered by Duke freshman star Zion Williamson during Wednesday night's game against North Carolina.
""Well, knowing what I know now, college is bulls---,"" Cousins said after Thursday's shootaround. ""College basketball and the NCAA is bulls---. So my advice to him is, 'Do what's best for you and your family.'
""Obviously college ... it does nothing for [Williamson] at this point. You've proven you're the No. 1 pick coming out, you've proven your talent. Get ready for the next level, because it's happening. That's my opinion, knowing what I know now. Obviously, when I was at that age, you enjoy the moment, you're enjoying the experience and all that. But there's so many risks involved to get to the ultimate goal, which is this level. So just do what's best for him and his family.""
The nightmare started for Duke less than 40 seconds in. The bad dream didn't let up.
As the basketball world holds its breath about the Zion Williamson injury, our panel weighs in on what it could mean.
Duke's Zion Williamson left the game with an apparent knee injury after breaking his left shoe and NBA players reacted on social media.
Cousins, who spent one season at Kentucky before being selected with the fifth pick in the 2010 NBA draft, said he enjoyed his time in college, but he has a different perspective after almost a decade in the professional basketball.
""I loved my experience in college,"" Cousins said. ""... But with that being said, just how crooked the whole NCAA business is -- I actually saw a post the other day where I think the highest ticket for that UNC-Duke game was $2,500, $3,500. How much does Zion Williamson see? That's who they're coming to see, so how much of that is he getting? Actually, who does it go to? How does it benefit any player on that team? But if they were to get $20 and a free meal, they're this bad kid, they get a bad rep, uncoachable, or thugs, whatever the case may be. So it's bulls---. It's been bulls---.""
Cousins believes the G League route, over time, will gain more traction with younger players looking for a different route to the NBA.
""The D League/G League route,"" Cousins said, ""I think that's helpful. Obviously, it's not a popular thing right now, but I think it will grow over time. You've seen a couple of young guys in that program already.
""So it was kind of cool what [LaVar] Ball did with his whole little league. I think it's a cool thing. Obviously he doesn't have the greatest name and people look at him in a foolish manner, but what he's doing makes sense. He wants to help these kids. He understands how the college level, he understands how it's corrupt. He saw what his kid went through. He sees what his other two boys are going through, so I think there's ways [to fix the system]. Obviously everything with basketball is a trendy thing, so once the ball kind of gets rolling for that, I believe more people will be willing to join it.""
Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James was more demure in his thoughts regarding what Williamson's next step should be.
""I have no comment on what he should do for his future,"" James said Thursday. ""If he needed any advice, he can find a way to find me, but it is not for you guys, it is not for someone to go sit across the table and say, 'Well, LeBron said this about this kid.'
""He has to do what is best for him. His family has always been his support system. I just wish great health for the kid, but that's not my lane to talk about what he should do going forward.""
While there has been some more chatter in recent months about the NBA abolishing the ""one and done"" rule for players coming out of high school, it remains in place at least for the next couple of seasons as the NBA, NCAA and NBPA continue working toward a solution.
Like many NBA players, Cousins doesn't see the need for the rule.
""I don't really understand the point of it,"" Cousins said. ""What's the difference between 18 and 19 or 17 and 18? You're immature, you're young, you're ignorant to life in general, so what's really the difference? You still got a lot of growing to do as a man.""

26125829,"PHOENIX -- Saturday was a new low for a Los Angeles Lakers team that has been digging itself into a deeper and deeper hole in recent weeks, losing to the league's worst team, the Suns, 118-109.
The loss to the Suns (13-51) dropped the Lakers to 30-33, 4½ games behind the LA Clippers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference with 19 games to play.
The Lakers played the Suns on the second night of a back-to-back, having given the league-best Milwaukee Bucks all they could handle Friday before coming apart in the end in a 131-120 loss. Before tipoff Saturday, Lakers coach Luke Walton told reporters it was a ""game we have to win.""
The Lakers have fallen to their worst postseason odds yet this season, listed at +600 to reach the playoffs following Saturday's loss to the Suns.
Lakers owner Jeanie Buss said the media's coverage of the team's pursuit of Anthony Davis was ""irresponsible and frustrating"" and ultimately false.
This week we highlight LeBron's challenge, the Anthony Davis situation, Trae Young and a young Knick.
Then L.A. went on to trail by as many as 10 in the opening quarter.
""We need to be better,"" Walton said afterward. ""We need to be a lot better.""
Many of the same issues that have plagued the team all season converged in Saturday's calamity. The defense, which ranks 24th in points per game allowed, let the Suns shoot 65 percent from the field in the first quarter, setting up the rhythm to ultimately score 118 -- more than the already massive 113.9 points per game Los Angeles has allowed this season.
The Lakers' 3-point shooting, tied with the New York Knicks for 27th in the league at 33.8 percent, was even worse as they shot 8-for-25 (32 percent), and their free throw shooting, last in the league at 69 percent, was also an abomination, going 15-for-23 (65.2), including two big misses by LeBron James with 47.4 seconds left in the fourth quarter and Los Angeles trailing by five.
""I mean, listen, we obviously, we needed this game for obvious reasons,"" James said. ""We wanted to play well. At times we played well. I think we was always together at times as well. Had the right mind frame of what we were trying to accomplish tonight. It's just unfortunate with the opportunity that we had, and we haven't been able to seize that opportunity.""
There were several sequences that stood out to illustrate just how ugly things have become for the Lakers in a season that feels as if it's slipping away.
Like when Suns rookie Deandre Ayton sprinted down the floor to chase down a loose ball midway through the third quarter with Kyle Kuzma and Brandon Ingram both seemingly stuck in cement when the ball was heading in their direction.
""Bounced right in front of us, that turned into a fast break for them,"" Walton said.
The Ayton dunk prompted Walton to call a timeout to draw up a play. When Los Angeles took the court, instructions in hand, it was called for a 24-second shot clock violation after it was unable to execute well enough to even make an attempt. It brought back memories of how the Lakers blew the Milwaukee game Friday night, when Kentavious Caldwell-Pope turned the ball over on an inbounds play late in the fourth quarter, a moment that, again, was directly preceded by a Lakers timeout.
Then there was James' inbounds gaffe when he threw the ball off the back of the backboard, resulting in a turnover.
""That was just silly on my part,"" James said. ""I thought I had a little bit more room to get it to [Ingram]. [Tyson Chandler] was kind of right there. Tried to throw it over [Chandler's] head and it hit the foam on the backboard. That was just stupidity on my part.""
The Lakers trailed by as many as 19 in the fourth quarter and cut it to 3 after a driving dunk by James (27 points, 16 assists, 9 rebounds) with 1:14 left. On the next possession, Josh Hart was called for a controversial foul on Ayton, resulting in two free throws that allowed the Suns to push their lead back up to five and salt away the win.
""The play with under a minute to go in a one-possession game where [Ayton] traveled twice and then offensive fouled? That play? Yeah, I didn't see Josh foul him, but maybe I'll get a better look at it from a different angle somewhere,"" a disgusted Walton said.
Focusing frustrations on one play would be folly for a team with three quarters of the season in the books. Saturday was only a carryover of many of the same issues that have occurred over and over again for the 2018-19 Lakers.
""Obviously there's something wrong with this team, and it's up to us to try to fix it, but not really sure right now,"" Kuzma said.
Walton clung to a shred of positivity as his team fell to 4-7 with James in the lineup since he returned from his left groin injury -- the one variable pointed to most often as the reason Los Angeles' season went off the rails.
""I'm confident,"" Walton said. ""I told you, I believe in our group. We need to play a lot better, but I believe that we can get it done.""
James' outlook wasn't quite as sunny.
""I'm not here to harp on the negativity or the negative. We had opportunities,"" he said. ""Yeah, we could've played better here, played better there. That's been throughout the whole season. But right now it's a tough loss.""
Hart was asked whether Walton's belief in his team extends to how his teammates believe in one another.
""I mean, we have to,"" Hart said. ""If we want to get to the goal that we've set for ourselves in the season, we have to believe in each other. We have to believe. We have to trust each other. That's what it comes down to at the end of the day.
""We can't not pass someone the ball or not make a rotation or get our heads down when something doesn't go our way. We have to as a unit when adversity starts, we have to come together, and that's something we have to keep working toward. Like I said, we have the talent, we have the ability, we have the leadership to pile up wins and to make a run for the playoffs, but we have to do that as a collective unit.
""And if we don't believe in each other, we don't trust each other, offensively or defensively, we're going to fail. That's not how you win. This game is about team, it's about being selfless, it's about sacrificing for the next player, and if you can't do that, you're not going to find success.""

26000920,"With the NBA descending upon Charlotte, North Carolina, for this weekend's All-Star Game, a topic of conversation among the league's elite will be Zion Williamson, the projected No. 1 pick in the 2019 NBA draft, who is playing his college basketball about 140 miles away at Duke.
Williamson already caught the eye of Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, who, alongside agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, close friend and associate Randy Mims and Lakers teammates Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Rajon Rondo, traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday to see Williamson and the No. 2-ranked Blue Devils beat the No. 4 Cavaliers.
""It was a game between the [top] teams in the country,"" James told ESPN of his decision to jet down from Philadelphia the day before the Lakers played the 76ers. ""Coach K [Mike Krzyzewski] is my guy. And the flight was 35 minutes. So, it was easy. It was easy to be able to do it. It was my first time seeing Duke play, I think, in my life. I want to go to Cameron [Indoor Stadium] someday, too, though.""
At 6-foot-7 and 292 pounds, Duke freshman Zion Williamson is a force on the basketball court. But Clemson's Dabo Swinney told Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski that he'd put Williams ""wherever"" he wanted to play on the football field.
LeBron James or Michael Jordan? You've heard everyone else's take, but let's look back at what the two GOATs have said about each other since they first met back in 2001.
For James, who had superstars like Shaquille O'Neal and Allen Iverson come watch his high school games, it was a chance to bring things full circle.
And while Williamson, and his soaring closeout block on Virginia's De'Andre Hunter, stole the show Saturday, James said the entire Duke team was impressive. It's a team that his oldest son, LeBron James Jr., could join someday, having already received a standing scholarship offer from Krzyzewski, according to sources.
""I love what those young boys are doing over there,"" he said. ""I love what Zion and RJ [Barrett] and Cam [Reddish] and Tre [Jones], I love what they're doing. So, [the trip] was a no-brainer. It was easy.""
With his 6-foot-7, 285-pound frame and all-around game, Williamson is drawing comparisons to the 6-8, 250-pound James as one of the best prospects ever to be on the NBA's radar.
""What strikes me? His agility and his quickness,"" James said. ""For his size, how strong he is, to be able to move like the way he moves, he's very impressive. I mean, everybody can see the athleticism. That's obviously, that's ridiculous. But the speed and the quickness that he moves [with] at that size is very impressive.""
James also lauded Williamson's maturity, especially with how he responded to Scottie Pippen suggesting last month that he sit out the rest of his freshman season to avoid injury and protect his future earning potential with his draft stock already set.
""I can relate in a sense of he's been covered since he was in high school and everybody is trying to compare him to the next this or the next that. But the best thing I've noticed is he seems like a good kid. He seems like he's got his head on straight,"" James said. ""And when they asked him about, you know, guys in our league and people who cover our league talking about, 'If I was Zion Williamson, I would sit out for the rest of the year,' he was like, 'That's [silly]. Why? I'm here to play basketball. I love to play basketball. I'm here at Duke, I'm having fun. These are my friends. I'm having a great time. Why would I sit out?'
""That's the type of s--- that strikes me. Everybody gets so caught up in the game itself. I look at the intangibles. And he seems like he has great intangibles and seems like a great kid.""
James and agent Paul took exception to anyone who thought the visit was a recruiting trip.
""A recruiting trip? I didn't talk to anybody,"" James told ESPN.
""They're only saying that because it's Rich. When Shaq came to see me play in high school, when A.I. came to see me play in high school, they weren't saying it was a recruiting trip then. But because it's Rich Paul and LeBron, now it's a recruitment trip.
""Now Rich is a threat to everybody, and they look at it and they want to keep trying to jab my agent and jab my friend. And what is he doing that's wrong? They don't say that about no other agent when other guys go see [players]. They don't say that about no other agent, but my guy because he's a threat.
""And he's African-American, too. Throw that in there.""
Paul pointed out how perception has changed since he and James attended college games in the past.
""All I care about is respect,"" Paul told ESPN. ""That's all. We were just enjoying a basketball game. Didn't talk to nobody. Didn't do anything or nothing. But it's an issue when you see several media people shining a light on it as if it's a negative thing. But when I was one of his homeboys, one of his 'posse' and we went to see Steph Curry in Detroit (for a Davidson-Wisconsin NCAA tournament game in 2008), nobody said anything. Nobody said nothing.""
Paul then discussed the coded language he has heard directed toward him throughout his career.
""Think about it from this perspective,"" he said. ""On one end, you got a 'posse.' Or they're 'leeches.' Years ago it was leeches or 'hanger-ons.' They're OK when they can call you that, but they're not OK when it's a CEO and you have the biggest superstar in the world supporting somebody that he trusts to do his business off the court and just who happens to be a friend.""
Since Williamson's game in front of James, the legend of the Duke phenom has only grown. He posted 27 points, 12 rebounds and 3 steals Tuesday in a come-from-behind win over Louisville in a game the Blue Devils once trailed by 23 points. On Saturday, Williamson and Duke host NC State.
There is sure to be plenty of NBA personnel on hand.

26156982,"LOS ANGELES -- LeBron James says his first encounter with Michael Jordan was like meeting God. Now, he is a spot above him in the scoring heavens. James passed Jordan on Wednesday night to move into fourth place on the NBA's all-time points list.
Entering the Lakers' game against the Denver Nuggets trailing Jordan by 12 points, James tied Jordan at 32,292 career points with a fadeaway 19-footer midway through the second quarter, then passed him with an and-1 layup at the 5:38 mark.
James sank the free throw to complete the three-point play and went on to finish the game with 31 points, putting him at 32,311 for his career. The Lakers lost 115-99.
Rajon Rondo didn't think it was a big deal that he sat in an empty courtside seat toward the end of Wednesday's loss to Denver, saying he has done it ""maybe eight, 10 times this year.""
LeBron James passed Michael Jordan on the all-time scoring list, rising to fourth. The NBA world reacted to the milestone.
LeBron James has surpassed Michael Jordan on the NBA's all-time scoring list, but there are more important matters at hand.
""Of all the stuff I've done in my career, this ranks right up there at the top with winning a championship,"" James said. ""For a kid from Akron, Ohio, that needed inspiration and needed some type of positive influence, MJ was that guy for me. I watched him from afar, wanted to be like MJ, wanted to shoot fadeaways like MJ, wanted to stick my tongue out on dunks like MJ, wanted to wear my sneakers like MJ. I wanted kids to look up to me at some point like MJ and it's just crazy, to be honest. It's beyond crazy.""
In anticipation of the scoring feat, James tweeted before Wednesday's game that moving past Jordan would be ""unreal."" He also wore a pair of Nike LeBron 16s designed in the style of the Air Jordan III ""white cement"" model. He wrote ""Thank you M.J. 23"" on the side of one of the sneakers.
Can't even front. This is going to be UNREAL!! Wow man
""I kind of take all accomplishments as they come, and anytime I'm in the breath of any of the greats and, obviously, MJ being the guy I looked up to my whole life, a guy I aspired to be when I was a kid and just, I think it's going to be pretty cool,"" James said at shootaround Wednesday morning.
""I don't know how I'll react in the moment, obviously, but I think at some point I'll be able to appreciate it, just knowing where I come from and knowing that it's so much bigger than just me.""
He reacted to the moment by hiding his face under a towel on the bench as he was swept up in emotion while the video board at Staples Center played a tribute highlighting the notable buckets of his storied career, such as his 10,000th point and 20,000th point.
""It was very emotional,"" he said. ""Very emotional. A lot of things that was going on inside of me at that point in time. I wanted to look up at the scoreboard to kind of see what was going on up there, but at the same time I didn't want to show what was going on behind that towel, so it's just crazy.
""Me and my best friends this is all we talked about was MJ. All we talked about was MJ. Outdoor courts, we used to play outdoor ball and you know in the snow in the rain in northeast Ohio and we all wanted to be MJ. We all wanted to be MJ, every last one of us. It's crazy. My high school best friends, they text me and they just can't believe it, I can't believe it, because we just remember walking up and down the Akron streets with a basketball, singing, 'I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike.'""
Jordan congratulated James in a brief statement Thursday that read, ""I want to congratulate LeBron on achieving another great milestone during his amazing career.""
James, 34, who was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the No. 1 pick in 2003 a couple of months after Jordan retired from the Washington Wizards at age 40, needed 118 more regular-season games than Jordan to reach the same scoring plateau. Yet, while Jordan has James beat in career scoring average (30.1 points per game to 27.1), James is ahead of Jordan in both rebounds (7.4 to 6.2) and assists (7.2 to 5.3). James, it should be noted, also reached the scoring mark on 1,240 fewer field goal attempts than Jordan.
After passing Michael Jordan, LeBron James breaks down what MJ means to him, meeting him for the first time and how he hopes to ""inspire the next kid.""
Lakers great and current president of basketball operations Magic Johnson tweeted his congratulations to James.
Congratulations to @KingJames for passing Michael Jordan's 32,292 points to become fourth leading scorer of all-time!
""Obviously, it's an incredible achievement,"" Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma said. ""Getting into the top four, approaching three, he's going to pass three and probably get into the top two, it's crazy to really think about.""
James passed Andre Miller for 10th on the all-time assists list earlier this season, making him the only player in league history to rank in the top 10 in both points and assists.
James reaching No. 4 in a Lakers uniform means that all of the top four scorers in NBA history played for the purple and gold at some point in their careers. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387 points) is No. 1, followed by Karl Malone (36,928 points) at No. 2 and Kobe Bryant (33,643 points) at No. 3.
James passed Jordan for first in all-time playoff points in the spring of 2017 -- although he still trails Jordan 6-3 in championships. The occasion allowed James a chance to reflect on Jordan's influence.
""I did pretty much everything that MJ did when I was a kid,"" James said at the time. ""I shot fadeaways before I should have. I wore a leg sleeve on my leg and folded it down so you saw the red part. I wore black and red shoes with white socks. I wore short shorts so you could see my undershorts underneath. I didn't go bald like Mike, but I'm getting there.""
James and Jordan do not have much of a relationship to speak of.
""Even with the relationship not being as you would want it as you're growing up, obviously, at the end of the day what he was able to do on the floor and off the floor throughout his playing days inspired a kid from Akron, Ohio, so that is more than enough of a relationship because he helped me feel like I could be something beyond this world as well,"" James told ESPN.
But James, like Jordan, has elevated his stature off the court thanks to a lucrative relationship with Nike; and James, like Jordan, has visions of someday owning an NBA franchise. And James is signed on with Warner Bros. to reboot the ""Space Jam"" franchise this summer.
Part of the disconnect between them has revolved around the conversation of greatest player of all time. James, on an episode of the ESPN+ series ""More Than An Athlete,"" said that leading the Cavs to their first title while becoming the only team in league history to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals to beat the Golden State Warriors in 2016 solidified his perch at the very top.
""That one right there made me the greatest player of all time,"" James said.
Jordan, for his part, rejected the notion that he earned that title.
""What everybody is saying I am, I never had the chance to compete against other legends that was prior to me,"" Jordan said years ago in an interview with ESPN's Michael Wilbon. ""I would love to have played against them, but I never did. For you to say that I'm better than him, I mean it's your opinion. It's their opinion. I accept that as their opinion. If you ask me, I would never say that I'm the greatest player.""
Jordan had no problem, however, offering his opinion of where James ranked as compared to Bryant, in comments made in August 2017 at his Flight School summer camp in Santa Barbara, California.
""Would I rank LeBron over Kobe in terms of best all time? No,"" Jordan said. ""There's something about five that beats three. Now, he may be better than that, but Kobe won five championships. LeBron won three.""
While the Jordan-James debate will surely rage on for decades, James has earned the respect of his contemporaries, regardless of rankings.
""LeBron is such a great overall player that sometimes he gets overlooked as a scorer, as crazy as that is,"" Dirk Nowitzki, the league's No. 7 all-time scorer, told ESPN. ""Sometimes his scoring, his clutch scoring even, is overlooked. But I think all the players know how good he is. He's basically a one-man fast break. All these years, if you have one man back, it's basically a basket.""
James said he received phone messages after Wednesday's game from his high school teammates who once shared in his emulation of Jordan. They've seen him turn an idol into a peer in the game's all-time pantheon.
""I mean, just listen, man. I always tell you guys, when you're an inner city kid from Akron, Ohio, like myself and my guys growing up, you look for anything, any lightning in a bottle that can inspire you, because you're put up against the numbers of failing,"" James said. ""The percentages of guys like myself -- single-parent household, only child, underprivileged -- making it out, it's not high at all. And MJ had a lot to do with me making it out, along with my mother, along with the city itself, along with the little league coaches I had. But Mike had no idea what he was doing for a kid that was growing a 45-minute flight from Chicago when he was putting in that work.
""You guys have no idea, man -- and I am trying to give it to you guys -- but you guys have no idea what MJ did for me and my friends growing up.""

Besides the 1980, 1985, 1987 and 1988 championship rings he earned as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar is auctioning off a game-used signed and inscribed basketball from his final game in 1989. He finished his legendary career with an NBA-record 38,387 points.
""When it comes to choosing between storing a championship ring or trophy in a room, or providing kids with an opportunity to change their lives, the choice is pretty simple. Sell it all,"" Abdul-Jabbar wrote on his blog about why he's auctioning off valuables from his sports history.
""Looking back on what I have done with my life, instead of gazing at the sparkle of jewels or gold plating celebrating something I did a long time ago, I'd rather look into the delighted face of a child holding their first caterpillar and think about what I might be doing for their future.
""That's a history that has no price.""
Abdul-Jabbar, 71, wrote that he's ""on a solid financial path"" and is not selling the items due to money trouble.
Some of the championship rings start with a minimum bid of $60,000. Also available on the website are game-worn jerseys, uniforms, trophies and even various keys to cities that he received.
""Since my life is still happening and ever-evolving, I am less personally attached to those items than I am to my desire to create new history for myself -- and futures for others,"" Abdul-Jabbar said. ""Much of the proceeds from my auction will go to support my charity, the Skyhook Foundation, whose mission is to 'give kids a shot that can't be blocked.'
""We do this by sending children from economically challenged schools to five days in the Angeles National Forest to experience the wonders of nature and learn the basics about science, technology, and engineering.""
Abdul-Jabbar is a six-time NBA champion; he won his first ring as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks, followed by five with the Lakers.

26149870,"THE CONVERSATION NBA COMMISSIONER Adam Silver had with Bill Simmons last week in Boston was perhaps the most candid and personal of his tenure. It was a refreshing departure from standard public sessions, which are often filled with rose-colored and obfuscation-filled comments.
One month from his five-year anniversary on the job, Silver admitted that the NBA has some real challenges. He said the league has made some mistakes that have caused him to lose sleep. He hinted that he's even re-evaluating what he wants his identity as commissioner to be.
There's no crisis, per se. Anyone who runs an $8 billion worldwide operation is always going to be managing a full plate of problems. He was letting us into his world in a way I've never seen before, sharing his real thoughts and fears -- or so it seems. And in a way, that showed both vulnerability and curiosity. It was wonderful.
Here are a few things he said and explained:
The owners chose to make contracts shorter in the past few collective bargaining agreements. That was meant to protect teams from bad deals and protect players from getting stuck being underpaid. But the change has helped transfer power to star players because of their ability to change teams more easily, and they can now pressure teams because of it. This is no small admission.
While the league has touted its massive global social media following for a decade, the focus of the discourse might have changed in a way that has hurt the league.
""At some point it does matter what they're saying, in terms of our brand, our values and what we stand for,"" Silver said. ""It's fine if it's speculation -- where is LeBron [James] going to go. People can talk about it and have all sorts of theories. It's not good when a player who is in the middle of a contract's agent shows up in a city he doesn't live and announces this player doesn't want to be here. That's bad for the fans there. It puts the league in a difficult position because it's an entertainment product.""
This got plenty of attention, but he said it strikes him that many players are truly unhappy, despite the massive amount of money now in the game and its popularity. He was amazed at how isolated some star players are.
He said All-Star Game changes were like ""putting an earring on the pig"" and indicated that long-term he might want to scrap All-Star Weekend to make room on the schedule for a midseason tournament.
Here are two larger points that merit discussion:
Silver said that market size imbalances are worrying him in a new way -- not as in the past, when players were limited in off-court opportunities if they played in small markets and therefore wanted to play only in big hubs. But now with the clustering of stars on teams -- even small-market teams -- the costs are creating cases in which teams might have to choose between keeping a contender together and franchise profitability.
""That's an unfair position to put our teams in,"" he said. ""Are you willing to be a deep taxpayer and lose money in order to compete? That's a fault in our current system.""
This is a big change from long-standing tradition, starting with David Stern, of the league saying a small market team could both compete and make money if it were well run -- if, say, you had Sam Presti as your general manager and not David Kahn. That's a hard sell these days, as Presti's Oklahoma City Thunder have one of the league's highest payrolls in one of its smallest markets so they could keep Paul George and Russell Westbrook. It's a path the Milwaukee Bucks could soon be headed down to keep their strong team alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo.
TV ratings for games are down this season. The All-Star Game ratings were down. Silver said the league is struggling to reach the millions of fans from the target age 18-34 demographic who don't have cable or streaming packages. They care about the league but don't build the habit of watching games on TV or in person, a core tenet of creating revenue.
""You see a tweet saying, 'Warriors-Rockets great matchup, Harden is going for 60.' The fact [is] you can't just [click] and get that game,"" Silver said. ""That transactional friction has to be eliminated. We're being paid a lot of money to gate our content right now [by TV partners]. What's happening is demand and supply aren't meeting.""
There are some real issues here. In addition to TV ratings, a midseason report that was recently distributed to teams showed that tickets sales are slightly down this season, according to sources. Overall ticket revenue is slightly up, but matched with the ratings trend, Silver has reason to be unsettled.
The Golden State Warriors make $3.4 million in gate revenue per game, best in the league. That's not a surprise, as it's a big market, and they're the best team. But the New York Knicks, the league's worst team, pull in an average of $2.9 million per game at the gate, sources said. Compared to the bottom of the list -- the Memphis Grizzlies get less than $1 million per night -- it shows the disparity.
This issue has been around as long as the league has. It's why the Warriors and Knicks pay into a pool of money that gets transferred to low-revenue teams such as the Grizzlies. But as Silver says, the Grizzlies would always have a great challenge to truly compete even if they were able to land two or three superstars. If the Knicks got two superstars -- and they're trying -- they'd be awash in cash like the Warriors.
That Silver is willing to discuss these topics at the Sloan Sports Conference is to be applauded. Since he became commissioner -- Silver recently got a big raise and a six-year contract extension -- he has focused a lot on revenue-generation.
He has negotiated a $24 billion TV rights deal, gotten a new, low-stress CBA done, brought in jersey ads and led the charge for legalizing sports betting while lobbying states to cut the league in on the deal.
There also have been player relations and transparency moves. He created last two-minute reports to make referee performance partially public. He has extended the All-Star break and regular season to build in extra rest and, at the request of James, made a rule that the team that wins the title gets to stay home for Christmas.
This version of Silver seemed so much different than the one who often answered questions pleasantly but somewhat dismissively -- ""We'll take a fresh look at it"" -- over the years. There was real meat here, and those who were at the panel or watched it got a better understanding of the health of the sport.
Silver seemed to start going down this path with comments during All-Star Weekend, when he admitted that some ""unintended consequences"" had led to star trade demands.
Here's hoping this continues. He seems to be spending a lot of his day worrying about how to get into the minds of millennials, be they players or fans. Being honest is a good way to start.
SEVERAL STREAKS MIGHT BE ENDING for James this season. His historic run of eight straight Finals and his streak of 13 straight playoff appearances look to be at an end. Another one might be in trouble: his 11-season streak of making first-team All-NBA, which is tied with Karl Malone for the longest in league history.
The Lakers' season is close to over. What's next?
• Lowe: LeBron vs. MJ implications
• Next three steps for the Lakers
• Will LeBron ever pass Kareem?
• This front office needs a new approach
The competition for forward spots this season will be intense on the first team, specifically with MVP candidates Antetokounmpo and George as strong contenders. Kevin Durant, who has made the first team six times, including last season, also figures to get votes.
After missing a career-high 18 games because of a groin injury and with the Lakers underwhelming, James, who was unanimously voted to All-NBA first team last season, might well slip. Kawhi Leonard, another contender for a spot, has missed 19 games because of injury or rest.
If James makes one of the three teams this season, it will tie the record for career All-NBA selections, at 15. Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan share that record. James has been a first-team selection 12 times and a second-team pick twice. The only time he didn't make the team was his rookie season in 2003-04.
MIAMI HEAT PRESIDENT PAT RILEY has given a couple interviews over the past week indicating that he is pursuing a strategy of clearing two max salary slots in the summer of 2020. The Heat have cap space coming already in '20 -- currently, they're in position to have more than $40 million, enough to sign one max player -- but Riley made it sound as if he's ready to dump some more salary to take a major swing.
Brian Windhorst and guests discuss the Warriors' road trip, how they can best utilize DeMarcus Cousins and much more. Listen now!
""Clearing space is easy. You just watched the Knicks do it, and what was their price in doing it? You watched the Clippers do it, and what was their price in doing it?"" Riley told reporters in Miami last weekend. ""We have the two picks [first-round selections in 2019 and 2020]. We have a lot of assets. We have cash. We have exceptions. We will improve the team. It will be much better than it is now.""
The Knicks traded Kristaps Porzingis to clear cap space, and the Clippers traded Tobias Harris because they weren't sure they'd re-sign him in the summer. The Heat don't appear to have such a player whom they could use to dump salary and get picks and young players, like the Knicks and Clippers did. However, they do have some attractive prospects, including Josh Richardson and Bam Adebayo.
The challenging contracts to move to get the Heat toward the two max slots would probably be Dion Waiters and James Johnson, who are scheduled to make $29 million between them in 2020-21.
The 2020 free-agent class isn't as deep in stars as this summer's group. But that year Anthony Davis is scheduled to be a free agent. There's also the possibility that some of the big names this summer could consider taking short-term contracts that would have them back in the market a year later. If the Heat have cap space, they also become a spot where star players could force a trade.
Miami missed out on the past few major free agents it went for, namely Durant and Gordon Hayward. But the Heat, in the midst of a few middling seasons and stuck in salary-cap jail, could be classified as a sleeping giant. Riley's plan to sign role players and combine them with guys developing in-house hasn't worked out. Now, he wants back in on the star hunt.

2619334,"""I expected a canned response,"" her father Chris told ESPN.
The letter from November led to a company-wide change to list sneakers in unisex sizing, with search results on the brand's website now showing all basketball products for men, women, boys and girls.
""I was immediately impressed when I saw Riley's letter; that a 9-year-old girl had the courage to use her voice to call attention to an issue and keep us accountable,"" Curry said.
Almost instantly, Curry called on his team at Under Armour to not only update the website search system but to also create a path to work with Riley on a colorway of his newest signature shoe. Curry's own handwritten response immediately went viral as well.
With International Women's Day serving as the perfect platform, the purple orchid, grey and white colorway was crafted, and features more handwriting from Morrison, in the form of aspirational phrases and sketches of girls playing basketball along the shoe's sockliner.
""She was focused on the opportunity for all girls, not just herself,"" Curry added. ""She's been an amazing catalyst for change -- not only with my product but also with the entire Under Armour brand. She is inspiring, and wise beyond her years.""
To celebrate the launch, Curry invited Riley from her hometown in nearby Napa, California, to the Warriors' home game against the Denver Nuggets. It was there that Curry also announced that all sales from the purple Curry 6 would help to fund a two-year, $30,000 scholarship for an aspiring graduating female high school student from the San Francisco Bay Area. The first recipient of the scholarship, Vivian Wu, was on hand to receive the award from both Curry and Morrison.
""Just a reminder that one small gesture can lead to something truly special,"" Curry wrote in an Instagram caption after the game.

A post shared by  Wardell Curry (@stephencurry30) on Mar 9, 2019 at 12:17am PST
This past week saw moments and milestones extend far beyond just the game, as LeBron James also celebrated an achievement he couldn't imagine.
As he was expected to pass Michael Jordan on the league's all-time scoring list, James and Nike worked up a detailed and inspired pair of his new LeBron 16 sneakers months ago, just for the occasion.
His latest signature shoe featured updated panels and design elements drafting off of the iconic Air Jordan 3, the shoe James wore as a tribute during one of his first preseason games as a pro in 2003. James wore two pairs during Wednesday's game, one with yellow laces during the first half, another with purple laces for the second half.
At halftime, he added his own handwritten inscription to the left shoe's midsole: ""Thank You M.J.""
""For a kid from Akron, Ohio, that needed inspiration and needed some type of positive influence, MJ was that guy for me,"" James said after the game. ""I watched him from afar, wanted to be like MJ, wanted to shoot fadeaways like MJ, wanted to stick my tongue out on dunks like MJ, wanted to wear my sneakers like MJ. I wanted kids to look up to me at some point like MJ and it's just crazy, to be honest. It's beyond crazy.""

Rockets wing PJ Tucker continued his impossible-to-top run of rare and exclusive sneakers, breaking out a pair of the Nike KD 3 originally thought to be made for only Kevin Durant.
""I've known KD for so long,"" said Tucker, who hosted Durant on his recruiting tour at Texas. ""We've been friends for years and I've always loved his sneakers.""
Featuring upgraded leather and faux horsehair along the collar, the pair was made for KD's reign over the league's short-lived H-O-R-S-E contest during the 2011 All-Star Weekend. The heel features a hilarious caricature of a horse shooting a jumper.
""This pair took me a long time to get,"" Tucker said. ""I sent him a picture, and his response was classic. We always talk and I always send him pictures when I get his old stuff. He literally said, 'PJ, I really don't think I even have a pair.'""
Durant typically wears a size 17 or 18. The fact Tucker tracked down his size 14 baffled even some of the Nike Basketball folks who worked on the shoe.
""I don't know many other people with this pair right here,"" he added. ""This pair is special for me.""
While he hasn't yet decided if he'll be retiring this spring or not, Vince Carter has been turning back the clock all season long in the Nike Shox BB4, the sneaker he headlined nearly two decades ago when he first signed with Nike, as he leapfrogged a human during the 2000 Olympics.
""The BB4 is where it started. It changed the game as far as the look,"" Carter recently told Nice Kicks. ""You didn't see a shoe that looked like that or was built that way.""
Nike has made him a handful of exclusive colorways to wear all season, and plans to re-release the shoe this year. The latest pair he debuted honored his team at the time of the original launch, the Toronto Raptors, with textures and graphics inspired by the team's mascot.
""It's something that I had been wanting to do. People had been asking me [about the shoe] for a long time,"" he added. ""I had asked [Nike] to bring them back a couple of years ago and I guess they just weren't ready to for whatever reason. I'm just glad it's back now. It's been a hit.""
Elsewhere in the league, DeMar DeRozan and Trae Young both debuted detailed editions of their latest sneakers, both of which were actually originally made in case they were named to the recent NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte, North Carolina. Young's laceless pair of the Adidas N3XT L3V3L feature a NASCAR-inspired series of touches honoring the host city, from a checkered flag graphic upper to gradient fading colors inspired by the veering race cars. DeRozan's latest Kobe 4 Protro colorway is accented by a gleaming chrome heel counter and grid map detailing along the toe.

26123155,"""There's always a love-hate relationship with the media when you're on this side of the business,"" Buss said during one of the multiple panel discussions that she took part in at the MIT/Sloan Analytics Conference in Boston on Saturday. ""The media, for example, there was a lot of hype and things written about a potential trade leading into the trade deadline -- all of it false. But it got a lot of coverage.
""There's damage that's done to team chemistry when players have to read about all this -- that is, to me, it's irresponsible and frustrating because it puts feelings that your players have [at risk] and you can't avoid it. It's part of the landscape that we deal with.""
Pelicans star Anthony Davis, appearing on LeBron James' HBO show, said his trade request is a reflection of his taking care of his career and ""doing what I want to do and not what somebody tells me to do.""
This week we highlight LeBron's challenge, the Anthony Davis situation, Trae Young and a young Knick.
The Lakers have fallen to their worst postseason odds yet this season, listed at +600 to reach the playoffs following Saturday's loss to the Suns.
On a different panel discussion, Buss also said, in part, ""The biggest challenge for [us is] the 'fake news' about how we were supposedly trading our entire roster for a certain player, which is completely not true. But those stories leak out and it hurt our young players. It wasn't fair. [Lakers president Magic Johnson] got in front of that, and I think we're back on the right track. Hopefully, that will allow us to make a playoff push coming up here.""
Los Angeles offered a package to New Orleans that included Josh Hart, Ivica Zubac, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and two first-round picks, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. It is unclear if there were any reports that the team was, indeed, going to trade its entire roster for Davis.
Johnson said last month that the Pelicans operated in bad faith during negotiations over a deal for superstar Davis.
""On my side, it seems like there's more things written and put out there that have no backup, nobody's name associated with the story or the quote, and an unnamed source. It's frustrating,"" Buss said at the conference in describing the current sports media landscape. ""I would rather see that not happen. I would rather see more responsibility with the media and maybe just taking it back a little bit to think about who it's affecting when they do write lies and conjecture and made-up stuff just to get clicks and followers. It's really not right.""
Regarding Johnson's penchant to comment on current NBA players, Buss defended her executive on Saturday. The Lakers were fined $50,000 last year for violating the anti-tampering rule after Johnson praised Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo. The NBA also looked into recent comments by Johnson about Philadelphia 76ers guard Ben Simmons but found no tampering.
""He's a very personable guy, and when he does interviews, he likes to say too much because that's who he is,"" Buss said. ""But he's evolved as an executive. He knows what he needs to do now. We want Magic out there. We don't want him to not be himself and not be the face of the franchise because he is.""
"
26137383,"LOS ANGELES -- It was the fall of 1981 and Magic Johnson was not happy. The Los Angeles Lakers had just won five in a row, but Johnson was feeling constrained by the new offense head coach Paul Westhead had installed.
Westhead met with his star point guard over what he called a ""lack of concentration,"" according to a Sports Illustrated report. It didn't go well. Because in the locker room after that meeting, Johnson told the media he couldn't play under Westhead's system anymore and wanted to be traded.
John Rockwell, a close friend of Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss, was dispatched to find a solution that didn't involve trading the conductor of Showtime.
""I go to Jerry and he says, 'Well, that's not a problem at all,'"" Rockwell recalled in a recent interview with ESPN. ""He said, 'Just fire the coach.' So, that's what he did. I was really surprised, but Magic was very important to the team.""
There is perhaps no greater articulation of the Lakers' unwavering commitment to the star system than the clarity Buss showed in choosing Johnson over Westhead.
There was no hesitation. Westhead was fired the next morning when the team returned to Los Angeles with three years and more than $1 million remaining on his contract. Pat Riley took over as head coach, and the rest is history.
The rest is history because Johnson performed and won championships. That's the other side of giving stars whatever they want, or think they want, in order to be happy. You better win enough to make all the special consideration worth it.Editor's PicksWill LeBron become the greatest scorer of all time?Can LeBron catch Kareem for the NBA's all-time scoring record?Sources: Lakers, Melo press pause on deal talksThe Lakers and free-agent forward Carmelo Anthony are pumping the brakes on a possible deal, with the team struggling in its pursuit of a postseason berth.1 Related
Can LeBron catch Kareem for the NBA's all-time scoring record?
The Lakers and free-agent forward Carmelo Anthony are pumping the brakes on a possible deal, with the team struggling in its pursuit of a postseason berth.
Kobe Bryant could dictate when and how much he was going to play, practice or pass to his teammates because he would go out and will the team to wins. And as he aged, Buss' kids rewarded Bryant for the five championships he won the franchise with a two-year, $48.5 million contract as he was coming off a torn Achilles tendon, just as Buss had rewarded Johnson.
Because of their experience with superstars and everything they bring along with them, there was perhaps no better franchise for LeBron James to play out his golden years than the Lakers.
They knew how to handle superstars. And at this stage in James' career, with three championships, eight consecutive NBA Finals appearances to his name and an equally burgeoning business and political profile off the court, James is a transcendent star. So the Lakers were prepared to do whatever he needed to be happy.
He didn't want to have a media conference in Los Angeles before he opened his Promise School back in Akron, Ohio. The Lakers said OK.
He talked with Johnson about finding playmakers and guys known for their toughness, which effectively resulted in a roster lacking in shooting and floor spacing. The Lakers went out and got players who fit that description -- who were willing to play on one-year deals.
Johnson said the Lakers didn't want to make the team like the Cleveland Cavaliers all over again for James. But sure enough, James found himself back in a ball-dominant role; though he didn't have the shooters surrounding him to space the floor and open driving lanes to capitalize on his pinpoint passing, like he did in Miami and Cleveland.
Magic was right. It wasn't like Cleveland all over again: Los Angeles is ranked 22nd in offensive efficiency this season with the roster he put together.
But it all could have worked if James hadn't gotten hurt on Christmas Day and missed 18 of the next 19 games. James was just starting to find his footing with this new cast in Los Angeles. The team was starting to get healthy and find enough consistency to develop an identity.
Of course, James did get hurt. And pretty much everything since then has been a disaster.
After Monday's 113-105 loss to the LA Clippers, it seems increasingly likely the Lakers will miss the playoffs for a sixth straight season. It's a fate James hasn't felt since his second NBA season, and he has expressed nothing but disgust about it every time he has been asked.
A few weeks ago, James turned to the local beat reporters at his locker and tried to explain that they didn't know him well enough to understand that he did not tolerate losing like this. Then he turned to ESPN's Dave McMenamin, who had covered him during James' last four years in Cleveland, looking for some understanding and said, ""Dave knows me.""
James was exactly right. The Lakers treated him as they would any of the superstars who have donned the purple and gold; but the organization, its fans and the players didn't know him. They only knew of what he had done for Cleveland and Miami. He had equity where he'd won championships.
Here in Los Angeles, he just had expectations to deliver on or fall short of.LeBron and the LakersThe Lakers' season is close to over. What's next?• Lowe: LeBron vs. MJ implications

Had he won here before or wrapped his arms around the city once he arrived, there might be more understanding. But such is the downside of a superstar joining a new franchise at this stage in his career and then effectively failing to launch.
""I haven't been a part of a season with this [amount] of injuries to our key guys,"" James said. ""It's just the way the season has been.""
James and the Lakers really never got going before everything fell apart. And once it did, he couldn't do nearly enough to stop it.
It's hard to remember how good the Lakers and James looked before he tore his groin at the Golden State Warriors on Christmas and the wheels fell off. When the season is over and sober evaluations start taking place, perhaps that will factor into the decisions on how to move forward.
But right now, it all feels like a series of missteps and misfortune that everyone shares some blame in.
There was the failed pursuit of Anthony Davis that left half the players on the roster questioning whether James, the Lakers' front office or both still wanted them. That was a self-inflicted blow the team never seemed to recover from.
There were injuries to Rajon Rondo and Lonzo Ball that kept them out for huge chunks of time; nagging injuries to Tyson Chandler, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart; and trades for Mike Muscala and Reggie Bullock (long-awaited shooters!) that have yet to pay any real dividends.
The Lakers went 6-12 in the 18 games James missed. Since he has come back, they haven't been much better, and now they have lost nine of their past 12 games. James is still getting back into top shape after the most serious injury of his career, and it has manifested itself especially on the defensive end of the floor.
Through Christmas, the Lakers had a defensive rating of 104.5 when James was on the floor. Since Christmas, the Lakers have a defensive rating of 111.9 when James is on the floor.2019 NBA draftGet ready for Zion Williamson, Ja Morant and more.• Latest NBA mock draft

Since his return from injury, the Lakers have a defensive rating of 109.6 when James is on the floor in four wins; the Lakers have a defensive rating of 113.1 when James is on the floor in the eight losses.
It might not have been a strictly basketball decision for James to join the Lakers. But basketball is still his core business, and a failure like this doesn't sit well. That's the downside of committing as fully as the Lakers do to a star system.
""We're in a win-or-loss league,"" James said. ""And that's what it's all about. We've had positive. We've had a lot of negative, obviously as far as our play. But at the end of the day, we're in a result league. Results is how many wins you can accumulate throughout the course of the season, so you take the good with the bad and you just keep pushing forward.""
While the failures can't be placed on any one person, James, Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka will have to answer for a lot of it. Head coach Luke Walton could lose his job over it. Most of the roster wasn't going to be back next year anyway, given the team's insistence on signing players to only one-year contracts to preserve salary-cap space for a second star this summer. But you have to assume even larger-scale roster changes will be implemented given the disappointment of this season.

26261078,"""It's OK,"" Harden said when answering a question that started with how the Rockets were on a roll. ""Yeah. Nah, it's all right, man. We lost. We know we did. Good thing about it is we play again on Friday. It's one loss.""
Of course, a loss to the Warriors has the potential to carry more weight than others, especially for the Rockets, whom Golden State has eliminated in three of the past four postseasons, including last year's seven-game Western Conference finals.
DeMarcus Cousins ended the Rockets' win streak with his best game of the season. Does this version of Boogie make the Warriors unbeatable?
DeMarcus Cousins scored 27 points and had 8 rebounds and 7 assists in a performance he said was the most in rhythm he has felt all season with Golden State.
Klay Thompson scored 30 points, DeMarcus Cousins had a season-high 27 and the Golden State Warriors snapped Houston's nine-game winning streak Wednesday night with a 106-104 victory over the Rockets.
Houston coach Mike D'Antoni indeed bemoaned that his team made too many mistakes and said this should be something that will help the Rockets more than just by watching film.
""Well, it better be,"" D'Antoni said of experiencing the Warriors live as opposed to trying to learn from film. ""Sometimes you don't learn a lot when you win. ... If this didn't get their attention, then we're in big trouble. It'll get their attention. And we just gotta figure some things out and do a better job.""
Not only was Houston looking to win its 10th straight game on Wednesday, but it also had a chance to sweep the season series with Golden State for the first time since the 2009-10 season. The Warriors were playing without Kevin Durant, who was out with a sprained ankle.
Houston (42-26) trailed by 13 points with 4:52 left before storming back with a 14-2 run. But after Harden made the first of two free throws to get the Rockets to 106-104 with 6.4 seconds left, he missed the second, and Houston could not corral the rebound.
""Sometimes games like this can kind of wake you up,"" Houston guard Austin Rivers said. ""We won nine in a row ... you kind of let go of the rope a little bit or we make some mistakes that we've been getting away with maybe against some of the teams we have been playing over the last few weeks. I think it was maybe a reminder that when we play against them, obviously, that's the goal. The goal is to match up with them, whether it is second round or conference finals, whatever it may be.""
Klay Thompson completes his seventh straight season with 200 3s, while Steph Curry and DeMarcus Cousins have big games in the Warriors' win.
The Rockets were outrebounded by Golden State 44-31. Despite Durant's absence, the Rockets couldn't contain Stephen Curry (24 points), Klay Thompson (30 points) or DeMarcus Cousins, who had perhaps his best game as a Warrior with 27 points, eight rebounds and seven assists.
""They're still the team to beat,"" Rivers said. ""No matter how many times one beats them in the regular season, they're still the champs, and nobody knocks them off until you knock them off. Tonight was definitely a good learning lesson for us, and we will definitely learn from it.""
But as some of the Rockets will say, this defeat to the Warriors (46-21) was just one loss in the big picture.
""Yeah, that's a great team,"" Houston center Clint Capela said. ""Tonight, we lose by two, just because they were a little better in the details ... They just did a good job, a little bit better than us.
""But that's OK. That's 3-1 [in the regular-season series].""

26051117,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Former NBA swingman Stephen Jackson is happy that this era's players have more of a say in regard to where and with which teammates they want to play, but he doesn't think a lot of younger players have the same love for the game that his generation had.
""I love the fact that players have control of where they want to play,"" Jackson said before Thursday's game between the Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings. ""But at the same time, guys got to be professional, too. I would be the first to say these guys these days, they're spoiled. A lot of them are spoiled.
""And I was talking to a Hall of Fame football coach, and he said one thing he sees about basketball from the outside looking in, more players today are interested in what the game can do for them. They don't actually love the game like we did. I'm 41 years old, and I still play the game every day. And I can see that the love for the game is not there, but I'm happy that we had a hand in for these kids to be able to get the money that they're making, and the game is going, I'm happy [about] that. But at the same time, they got to be professional and continue to show fans that they love the game too, because it can get away from that.""
Jackson's commentary came after a question regarding player empowerment throughout the league, in the wake of New Orleans Pelicans All-Star Anthony Davis and several other players trying to force their way out of their current contract and onto another team.
We polled the ESPN Forecast panel of experts for their votes on the next teams for star players.
This week we highlight Joel Embiid chase-downs, Jayson Tatum's defense and Joey Buckets.
Jackson, who played 14 NBA seasons, was in town as part of a celebration of the 2006-07 ""We Believe"" Warriors team that stunned the basketball world by defeating the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the 2007 playoffs, becoming the first-ever 8-seed to knock off a No. 1 seed in a seven-game series.
Former Warriors coach Don Nelson, who also played 14 seasons in the league, was glad that players of this era have more freedom than players had when Nelson played in the 1960s and '70s.
""You couldn't leave a team,"" Nelson said. ""You were there for life. As long as they wanted to put you on the roster, you had nothing to do with a lot of things that are important to players today, which is movement, money, salaries. So it's way better now than it used to be, because I was in those locker rooms in the old days, when you couldn't -- once you were with a team, you couldn't leave.""
Jackson, who has stayed in the game while serving as a basketball analyst for ESPN and participating in the Big 3 basketball league, enjoyed discussing the game's past and present alongside Nelson and former Warriors teammate Jason Richardson.
""Winning. Making history,"" Jackson said of the Warriors' series win over the Mavericks. ""We had the blueprint from coach to do everything what we needed to do. Just executing and being able to make history. A lot of people didn't expect us to even make the playoffs. To make it and to win in the first round was special. Just winning is special.""

26031800,"Based on a sampling of attitudes on the topic over All-Star Weekend, there's a chance the coming Most Valuable Player race could morph into a bit of a basketball culture war.
Just to be clear, there are no hard feelings. Everyone, particularly the dozen-plus players surveyed on the matter, agrees the Houston Rockets' James Harden and Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo are having brilliant seasons -- with many nods toward Paul George, who has taken an unexpected leap in Year 2 with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Just because someone might favor one over the other doesn't make it an inherent dis.
But there is an undercurrent of division, and it seems to center on the nature of Harden's accomplishments.
The media seem fascinated with Harden's incredible scoring binge and have covered it as such, detailing his mounting 30-point games and creating a pursuit of what would've seemed like an untouchable Wilt Chamberlain record just a few months ago. It's why Harden was the clear-cut Vegas favorite to repeat as MVP as recently as last week, though Westgate SuperBook currently has them both at -110 to win MVP.
Brian Windhorst and Andrew Han make the trek to Charlotte for an action-packed All-Star weekend. Listen now!
While players acknowledge Harden's mastery, some are put off by the style: both the way the Rockets play and the way Harden expertly uses the current rules to his advantage. The enforcement of freedom of movement rules and the relaxing of travel calls on his step-back -- and to be clear, most of the time he executes the devastating move within the rules -- have helped supercharge Harden's season in a way that can irritate his opponents.
""Guys can say he gets away with travels on the step-back or he flings his body into people to get fouls, but honestly, a lot of us get away with stuff like that,"" said one All-Star who wished to remain anonymous because he didn't want to court controversy.
""Just speaking for myself, and I don't know how others feel, but what he does isn't always team basketball. If you look at how Giannis plays, that's more the way I was raised in the game. Just my opinion,"" he said.
Based on admittedly unscientific conversations, there are many players who agree. Earlier this season, Harden scored 304 consecutive points that were unassisted. That streak was tracked with awe by fans and media. For some players, though, it created eye-rolling because it represented the opposite of team play.
The Harden counterpoint is simple. With the Rockets badly banged up and missing co-creator Chris Paul for weeks, Harden felt he was doing what he needed to keep the Rockets afloat in the highly competitive Western Conference.
It wasn't unlike the 2015 NBA Finals when the Cleveland Cavaliers were missing Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, and LeBron James was forced to dominate the ball and score. James came close to being the first Finals MVP from the losing team since Jerry West in 1969, but Andre Iguodala edged him out in the vote.
""We played the same exact way last year and we almost made it to the Finals,"" Harden said, defending the Rockets' style this season. ""I don't even care about the points, I'm just trying to win.
""We had a funky first half of the season. I just did whatever it took to keep our head above water. I was getting double-teams and triple-teams and I was doing whatever it took.""
Harden is getting plenty of credit for that by the media, which have the votes for the official award. He's now at 31 consecutive games with 30 or more points, tying Chamberlain for the second-longest streak ever. He's averaging 41.5 points during the run and the Rockets are 21-10.
In a victory last month in Golden State, his electrifying 3-pointer between Draymond Green and Klay Thompson to finish off a 44-point, 15-assist, 10-rebound game was a signature MVP moment. So many times the MVP winner is aided by a great narrative that is formed during the season, and this season, Harden absolutely has it.
Perhaps it's only fair. Two years ago, Harden had a strong MVP case, but Russell Westbrook had a phenomenal narrative: the first player to average a triple-double since Oscar Robertson while on a Kevin Durant-departure revenge tour. Westbrook got more than three times the first-place votes as Harden, who finished second.
Harden's play, Harden's story and Harden's killer highlights are lining up for him.
But just like with Westbrook, who has been accused of chasing triple-doubles, Harden fights against the purists. Those individuals seem to favor Antetokounmpo, who plays a more classic team-centric style that highlights old-school brute force of going to the rim over new-school efficiency like 3-pointers and free throws.
Antetokounmpo is also a terror at the defensive end. Harden is not, though he has developed into more of a defensive playmaker and is third in the league in steals per game. And the Bucks, it is important to point out, own the league's best record at 43-14.
""What is the most valuable player? He sets the tone for our entire organization, our work ethic, our approach to every day,"" said clearly biased but thoughtful Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. ""You can talk about stats and Wilt Chamberlain and Shaquille O'Neal and things. But when you've changed an entire organization, changed the way people come to work every day and set a tone, that's value to me.
""I feel like he's the most valuable player in our league. He's changed things in Milwaukee. He's changed them for the better. We're one of the best teams because of Giannis.""
If we're being honest here, if the vote were taken today, Harden wins over Antetokounmpo, and it's probably not that close. There's still roughly a third of the season to be played, of course. But in the coming weeks, as this topic really heats up and influential voices are asked for their opinion on the matter, the answers could be revealing. There isn't a right or wrong answer per se. Favoring one is not an insult to the other, though this is a point that can often be overlooked.
In the end, it's healthy for the NBA if the MVP race is competitive. Having a variety of opinions and styles juices the conversation and makes winning it all the more honorable. If it wasn't debatable and people didn't care, it wouldn't be any fun.
This season, the race could be just a little more spicy than usual.
Brian Windhorst breaks down what should be a very exciting playoff push following the All-Star break.
ADAM SILVER IS A FAN of international soccer. Over the past five years, he has applied several concepts from the world's most popular and highest-grossing sport. Jersey ads, the embrace of gambling and the idea of midseason tournaments are all Silver conceits that have come in one form or another from soccer.
While being pressed over All-Star Weekend on how to deal with tanking, Silver brought out another soccer concept: relegation.
""People who are familiar with the operation of other leagues, you understand now why there's relegation,"" Silver said last Saturday. ""Because you pay an enormous price if you're not competitive. I think, again, for the league and for our teams, there's that ongoing challenge of whether we can come up with yet a better system.""
Relegation is a system in which the bottom teams at the end of the season are demoted to, essentially, the minor leagues. And the top teams in the minor leagues every year are promoted to the top league. Clearly, this eliminates tanking and creates a double drama at the end of the season: the race for the top and the race to get out of the bottom.
Now, let's be clear: Silver is not hinting that NBA teams worth billions could go to the G League. However, there are other ways to ""relegate"" teams besides dropping them down a division. And this is what Silver might be hinting at when saying the league needs to ""come up with a better system.""
Commissioner Adam Silver discussed tampering, trade demands and more in Charlotte. What does it all mean for the future of the league?
Who will emerge in the Eastern Conference? Will LeBron and the Lakers make the playoffs? Is James Harden an MVP lock? Those are just some of the questions to be answered in the next seven weeks.
In the past, anti-tanking measures have meant messing with the lottery odds. The league has changed the odds six times, tinkering to try to get it right. This year there's a new formula, with the bottom odds flattened out (the three worst teams in the league will each have a 14 percent chance at the top pick) to try to dissuade tanking. The early returns aren't showing an instant effect. Just look at the standings.
In the future, perhaps there's another way to discourage tanking. When you want results in the NBA, always go for the money -- for example, cutting the payout teams at the very bottom get from the leaguewide revenue pool, or perhaps temporarily reducing a team's cap space or salary-cap exceptions as a penalty.
There's a precedent for this. Teams in the luxury tax have a different set of rules from teams out of it. As a result, teams have to make a decision whether to cross the line. A similar dilemma could be created for tankers.
Right now, teams who gun for the worst records are ""rewarded"" with better draft odds. The ""penalty"" is a bunch of losses and miserable fans. That doesn't seem to be bothering certain franchises.
THE LEAGUE'S BEST BUDDING RIVALRY might be between the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks. They played a seven-game series last spring and have split two games in Boston this season. As the bracket currently sets up, this is a possible second-round playoff matchup.
They play only three times, and their final meeting during the regular season is Thursday in Milwaukee. The first two games have shown interesting strategies.
Brad Stevens has elected to play Antetokounmpo mostly straight up and not allow teammates advantages from double-teams. He has averaged 32 points but just 3.5 assists against Boston this season.
Budenholzer has dared the Celtics to shoot from the outside. Boston averaged 44.5 attempted 3s in the two games, going 24-of-55 from deep in a Nov. 1 win and 10-of-34 in a Dec. 21 loss.
Whose philosophy wins this time?

26276700,"Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade suffered a bruised right hip after a nasty fall during the Heat's 113-98 loss to the visiting Milwaukee Bucks on Friday night.
Wade was hurt on a drive to the basket late in the third quarter. The veteran went up hard for a contested layup, making contact with the Bucks' Pat Connaughton in midair and then tumbling to the court, unable to break the fall.
Wade remained on the court, writhing in pain, before needing help from several teammates to get back on his feet. The 37-year-old immediately went to the Heat locker room, but was able to walk there under his own power.
Wade returned midway through the fourth quarter.
Set to retire at the end of the season, Wade was questionable for Friday night's game due to a bruised right elbow, but coach Erik Spoelstra gave him the nod to play before the game.
Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon left the game earlier and did not return with right heel soreness.
"
26118445,"James Harden is dribbling up to the left wing as the Houston Rockets are down three with 48 seconds left. Kevin Durant calls off Andre Iguodala. He wants to guard his former teammate in one of the most intense moments of this season.
Durant, one of the longest wing defenders this league has ever seen, picks up Harden about 35 feet from the rim. His arms are already raised to prevent even the longest 3s Harden might consider.
But it's not Durant's arms that Harden is focused on -- it's his Nikes. As the pair arrives at the 3-point line, Harden invites his old friend to dance. Harden crouches into his coil and begins to break down Durant. It won't take long. He's about to tie the game with the definitive move of the season.
Harden uses a left-handed dribble to edge toward the 3-point line. With exactly 46.0 seconds remaining, the ball has bounced back up into Harden's hand. He's done dribbling, but his unhurried demeanor still gives no hint that a split-second later he's going to bury the game-tying 3 in KD's face.
By the time the clock reads 45.7, Harden has already destroyed Durant's defensive stance and laid the groundwork for the shot that will tie the game.
Harden lurches his left foot forward and suddenly jerks his body as if he's going to penetrate. But his back foot hasn't even moved.
His stance is widening, and instead of dribbling the ball, at the last moment he gathers it up and propels himself backward while simultaneously morphing into jump-shooting mode.
It might be a travel, but it happens so fast and there are so many moving parts that it's virtually impossible to detect with the naked eye. Durant is off-balance and can't recover in time.
On average, the Harden step-back creates about 6 feet of shooting space, per Second Spectrum data. By the time Harden brings the ball through his shot pocket, the defender attempting to close the gap is always too late.
Check out that last still shot. It looks like a teammate set up Harden for a standard catch-and-shoot 3. But this space was created by the shooter himself, and that's what makes it so damn dangerous: Harden can create clean 3-point looks at will.
Depending on what you consider to be the beginning of the act, Harden's step-back jumper takes about one second. In that second, he breaks his defender's balance, creates the shooting space, brings the ball through his shot pocket and releases it. It's the most dangerous second in the NBA, and although defenders know it's coming, they don't know exactly when. At T minus 1, they're still clueless that liftoff is already happening.
Despite the fact that Durant's wingspan is enormous, despite the fact that he was Harden's teammate for years in OKC, despite the fact that the stakes were so high, and despite the fact that we all knew what Harden wanted to do -- it didn't matter. He did it anyway. He tied this Jan. 3 game with the step-back 3. The Rockets ended up winning in overtime.
As Harden proved that night in Oakland, the step-back 3 is our Most Valuable Player's most valuable play.
Here's a stat: At 29 years old, Harden is the NBA's all-time leader in unassisted 3s. This says just as much about his bewildering greatness as it does about the sudden and rapid rise of unassisted 3-point shooting around the NBA. He's ahead of LeBron James by more than 100 makes.
At 29, James Harden is already the all-time leader in unassisted 3s in NBA history. pic.twitter.com/TugdcLdzaZ
Not only is Harden an offensive savant with an uncanny ability to create offense by himself, but his prime also just happens to coincide with a time and a place obsessed with efficiency and 3-point shooting. What's happening in Houston is the perfect storm of innovation and creativity from the front office, coaching staff and superstar. The Rockets are showing us the future of NBA basketball.
Luka Doncic ranks second in the NBA with 2.9 step-back 3s attempted per game this season, according to Second Spectrum tracking. Harden's at 8.0. Nobody else is even close. Why does Harden rely on the step-back 3 so much? It works! Harden's step-back 3s generate 1.20 points per shot on average -- better than the Warriors' league-leading 1.15 points per shot. A hypothetical offense consisting solely of Harden step-back 3s would yield points faster than the best offense on the planet.

The race to the top of the NBA draft is different this season. Here are our projections.
This week we highlight LeBron's challenge, the Anthony Davis situation, Trae Young and a young Knick.
Harden would thrive in any era, but he's particularly well-suited for one in which perimeter contact is illegal, traveling enforcement is meek and 3-point shots are the holiest act in the league. Over the past decade, the game has changed. Not too long ago, offensive tactics were designed to create good looks near the hoop. Now space 24 feet away really matters. It's an ongoing metamorphosis, but while the rest of the league is still trying to comprehend its own transformation, our bearded butterfly down in Houston is already flying away with scoring championships and potentially his second MVP.
About 83 percent of NBA 3s are assisted. After all, jumpers from that far away are hard. Even the league's most talented 3-point specialists require a clean workspace to hurl the dang orb through the ring at acceptable rates from that distance. As great as dudes like Klay Thompson or Kyle Korver are, they still need a balanced base and open space. In turn, this decade's rise in 3s really meant the rise of the catch-and-shoot 3. Offenses began decorating the outside edges of the scoring era with more and more threats while devising strategies to create clean looks for those guys.
That doesn't apply to Harden, who is using the Mike D'Antoni era in Houston as a lectern for an ongoing lecture series about deforming superstardom in pro basketball. No stats characterize this deformation as much as his unassisted 3-point numbers. Just look at this spike since D'Antoni arrived before the 2016-17 season:
As a young player in Oklahoma City, Harden's 3-point approach was basic. Over 85 percent of his triples were assisted back then. Once he entered the Daryl Morey ecosystem in Houston, the conventions started to erode. In his first four years there, the assist rate on his triples hovered around 50 percent, and Harden starting getting comfortable dribbling into his 3-point tries. Still, under Kevin McHale, Harden could never really let his freak flag fly.
In D'Antoni's first season, Harden's green light got much bigger. He cracked 100 step-back 3s for the first time, and suddenly less than a third of his 3s were assisted, per Second Spectrum tracking. Last season, that assist rate dropped further to 26 percent. So far this season, it's under 14 percent.
Here are the top three seasons for unassisted 3-point makes in league history.
Are you not entertained?
Harden, the outlier pic.twitter.com/cbx8tc1Ozn
The Harden Step-Back™ is a process designed to induce magnetic repulsion through a confluence of events:
Harden's jab step tempts his defender's body backward toward the basket, but Harden isn't going that way. That initial move is a red herring.
His back foot is still as a statue, marking the location of the future jumper.
His stance widens, and just as his defender's mass is fading toward the rim, Harden propels his own backward off of that jab step toward his back foot.
As the two feet reunite, he's already commencing the launch function. Harden simultaneously gathers his final dribble and brings the ball through his shot pocket and up to his release point.
Through the lens of the league's player tracking system, the Harden-Durant encounter looks like some weird demonstration of particle physics. The bearded particle first tricks his man into thinking he's driving before yanking backward straight into a 3-point jump shot.
Here you can pinpoint the moment when Durant's momentum carries him toward the hoop while Harden propels himself backward:
The sequence takes only about one second, but so much happens. Look at this:
At the exact moment Durant is the farthest from him, Harden already has the ball in his shot pocket, ready for launch. Durant desperately tries to recover and close out, but it's too little, too late. Another unassisted 3 gets its wings.
Here's a key caveat: The whole thing works because defenders like Durant have to honor the drive. Harden's jab step is terrifying because it presents a real threat in ways that, say, Buddy Hield's does not. Many 3-point specialists' jab steps don't scare anybody. Harden is arguably the best attack guard in the league. If you don't honor his jab, he'll blow right by and score at the rack. In a weird way, the implicit threat of Harden's drive is the biggest feature of his step-back 3. JJ Redick or Reggie Bullock couldn't do this.
It's no coincidence that this wild explosion in unassisted 3-point offense is happening in Houston. More than any other team, the Rockets quantify their own productivity and try to find ways to hack their own offensive efficiency rating. Triples have long been the most visible method for that approach. However, Harden's unprecedented volume of step-back 3s is proof the Rockets are still tinkering with their philosophy. Their front office and their coaching staff deserve credit for being open-minded and embracing a tactic centered around what many would've labeled a bad shot just a few years ago. Many teams still do.2019 NBA draftGet ready for Zion Williamson, Ja Morant and more.• Latest NBA mock draft

There are sure to be copycats, but man, this isn't easy. Even the best basketball league in the world isn't teeming with fellas capable of draining hundreds of 25-foot step-backs per season.
Still, some are trying. Doncic, Damian Lillard and Devin Booker aren't blind. They're all seeing what we're seeing. So are their coaching staffs. Durant, Kyrie Irving and Steph Curry are watching, too. Harden may be the prophet showing us that perimeter isolations are an offense unto themselves, but he won't be the last.
If you love do-it-yourself iso 3-point shots, you're going to love the future of the NBA.
The unassisted 3 is the emergent shot of the moment. It's no surprise that Morey, D'Antoni and Harden are the main characters in this story. They're the space force from Space City, winning the offensive arms race with newfangled weaponry we've never seen. Once again, they're the harbingers of future basketball.

26225526,"SAN ANTONIO -- The batty occurrences at the AT&T Center continued Sunday with play delayed for the third time this season when a bat swooped onto the court during the third quarter of the San Antonio Spurs' 121-114 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.
The scene reminded some Bucks players in the postgame locker room of a remark made to SB Nation by center Brook Lopez, who welcomes the opportunity a bat sighting could bring.
""If you've learned anything from the modern superhero myth, if you see a bat around and it bites you, you have a 75 percent chance of ending up a superhero,"" Lopez told SB Nation. ""Otherwise, you'll probably get really sick. But it'd be cool to be a superhero. You don't need to be too afraid. I'd say give it a shot.""
Remembering Lopez's remarks, both Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe, sitting side by side in the locker room, asked Lopez where he was when the bat came onto the court.
""I was standing right there. It was swooping down on me. I made myself available,"" Lopez said, spreading his arm wide while teammates laughed.
San Antonio's mascot, nicknamed ""Coyote,"" immediately jumped onto the floor and captured it with a net. Celebrating a birthday during the game, Coyote was also wearing a Batman costume when it caught the wayward bat as Bucks players such as All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo and Bledsoe scurried in different directions to avoid contact with the animal.
Mama I got attacked today�� #theundefeatedSanAntoniobatslol
- Eric Bledsoe (@EBled2) March 11, 2019
Bledsoe was asked what goes through his mind when he sees a bat flying his way: ""Stay out the way. I was just trying to stay out of the way. That kind of scared me when they brought the little net-catching things over there. I tried to get out of the way of that, too.""
Officials were forced to stop play in the opening quarter of Thursday night's Nets-Spurs game when several bats swooped down onto the court.
On another batty night in San Antonio, the Spurs' mascot made the play of the game.
Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, asked Lopez and the media assembled near his locker why San Antonio's mascot is ""a Coyote and not bat.""
""Oh yeah, definitely [I was scared],"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I think this is the first time I've seen a bat up close. I'm scared of all the insects. I don't like roaches. I don't like ants. And if I don't like that, I don't like a bat. I tried to run away.""
Three bats delayed a Spurs game in January against the Phoenix Suns, and despite arena officials putting together a plan to stop another bat invasion, they weren't able to prevent bats from delaying a Feb. 2 matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans for nearly two minutes. Prior to that game, arena officials erected netting to capture bats flying over the court.
But the Coyote captured the bats on Sunday against the Bucks and during the Feb. 2 game against New Orleans.

26244549,"CHICAGO -- As bleak as LeBron James' first season with the Los Angeles Lakers has been, he declared that the final chapter of his career won't be as rocky as Year 1 in L.A.
""Obviously, I would love for the team to be in the postseason,"" James said after the Lakers' 123-107 win over the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday. ""Even if I'm not a part of it, the postseason I've always loved. But right now, it's not the hand I was dealt, so you play the hand that you were dealt until the dealer shuffles the cards and you're dealt another hand and can do that.""
With 15 games to play, L.A. trails the Utah Jazz by 6½ games for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. James' personal streaks of 13 straight postseason appearances and eight straight NBA Finals berths are all but finished. But because he signed a four-year contract with the Lakers last summer, there will be more hands to be played in L.A.
LeBron is headed to the lottery in his first season out West. That means something ... but what?
We forecast the future of the NBA's best and worst teams.
""Definitely, I'll be watching it if we're not in there, and it looks like our chances are slim to none after each and every game, and so many teams in the West are playing well,"" James said. ""So you try to get better, but this won't be the last time I'll be in the postseason.""
Tuesday's win snapped a five-game losing streak for the Lakers. James turned in a vintage performance, putting up 36 points on 15-for-23 shooting, including several highlight-worthy dunks, to go with 10 rebounds, four assists and two steals in 33 minutes.
Despite the Lakers' plan to scale back James' minutes for the remainder of the season -- with the 32-minute range being a guidepost -- coach Luke Walton was prepared to sub James back into the game with three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter and his team up by 10, sending him to the scorer's table to check in.
If the lead dwindled into single digits, James was prepared to close things out and bring his minutes total to 36 or more, if an overtime session were needed.
""He was going back in,"" Walton said. ""He understood that depending on how that one or two baskets went while he was at the scorer's table, he was going to finish that game out for us. And he wants to. But when we went on the run, we put him back to the bench.""
James said that Tuesday's game -- relatively meaningless, as it was against a Bulls team that came into the night 30 games under .500 -- was a testament to his overall approach to the game.
""I don't talk about [being professional]. That's what I live,"" James said. ""You guys ask me questions, I answer questions, but I live being professional. I live playing every game like it's my last. No matter what's going on. You finish out strong. That's just who I am.""
In the absence of a postseason run by the Lakers (31-36), James said his team can use the rest of its trip with games against playoff-bound teams in Toronto, Detroit and Milwaukee as a kind of playoff proxy.
""We're still playing playoff teams,"" James said. ""For our young guys to be able to play playoff teams on the road, it's very key for their development still. We have an opportunity on this road trip. We go into Toronto our next game. We go into Detroit, who's a playoff team. We go into Milwaukee at the end of the trip. All playoff teams, all good teams. Those games will be like playoff games, if we want them to be. They'll get an opportunity to learn, and I get an opportunity to play with them, so we can take that out of it for sure.""
In Game No. 67 of Year No. 16 for James, the four-time MVP gave the visiting fans a show worth the price of admission, taking one outlet pass off the bounce from Kyle Kuzma and finishing with a two-handed, double-clutch reverse dunk. James grabbed a pass off the backboard from Josh Hart that he slammed home and punctuated with a shimmy on the baseline when he landed.
Did James feel particularly bouncy on this Windy City night?
""I always feel bouncy,"" he said.
In a season that has fallen flat, it was a possible preview of what James might still have in store for his Lakers tenure.
""That's what he does,"" Walton said. ""He got out in transition a few times on those. But he wants to win. He's one of the all-time great winners that our game has ever seen. I know that [missing the playoffs] hasn't happened to him since early, early, early in his career. So he's frustrated with it too, and he's continuing to battle out there, and he did a really nice job of helping us get a win tonight.""

26057309,"TORONTO -- The final seconds of the Milwaukee Bucks' victory over the Boston Celtics on Thursday night was full of drama, intrigue and, as it turns out, several incorrect calls.
The NBA's Last Two Minute Report for the Bucks' 98-97 win listed three incorrect calls on the final play alone, as well as an incorrect ruling on Brook Lopez's attempted tip-in with 3.7 seconds remaining.
The Lopez tip came after a jump ball, which was caused when Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo was tied up by Celtics guard Marcus Smart with 0.2 remaining on the shot clock. Antetokounmpo won the subsequent tip and hit the ball toward Lopez, as the burly 7-footer was positioned right near the rim.
Lopez succeeded in tipping the ball at the rim, which seemed to potentially allow the final seconds to slip away to seal Milwaukee's victory. However, officials ruled at the time that Lopez had attempted to shoot the ball, rather than tip it -- and because there was only 0.2 on the clock (rather than 0.3, which is the time required to get a shot off), it was deemed a shot-clock violation.
Crew chief Mike Callahan confirmed that was the ruling on the floor with a pool reporter following Thursday's game. The Last Two Minute Report, however, said it should in fact have been ruled a tip, and thus Lopez's shot should have counted.
The ensuing possession for the Celtics, however, was filled with even more issues. Three calls were said to be missed: an illegal screen by Kyrie Irving on Khris Middleton; a subsequent hold by Middleton on Marcus Morris to prevent him from using Irving's screen to catch a wide-open lob at the rim; and an Eric Bledsoe foul on Irving on his drive before he missed what would have been a game-winning shot.
Irving's shot was off target, however, and Milwaukee went on to win the game.

1. Golden State Warriors
Record: 41-16 (1st in West)
The Nuggets' staff might have coached in the All-Star Game, but the Warriors own the best record in the Western Conference. Keep an eye on Golden State and Denver as they battle it out for the top seed in the conference: The Warriors and Nuggets split a pair of games in Denver, while Golden State hosts the final two contests that could decide home-court advantage throughout the West playoffs. -- Spears
2. Milwaukee Bucks
Record: 43-14 (1st in East)
With the best record in basketball, Milwaukee is sitting pretty and should be concerned merely about maximizing its playoff potential. The trade to secure floor-spacer Nikola Mirotic, who will make his Bucks' debut after the break, was seemingly a wise move in that direction. -- Herring
3. Toronto Raptors
Record: 43-16 (2nd in East)
The Raptors have been one of the league's most consistent winners this season, even with the load management of Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry's missed games. Now they're without Fred VanVleet, a vital member of their rotation, for a few weeks. The pressing question down the stretch for the Raps: Can this high-IQ group that has endured sporadic absences find the cohesiveness necessary to win an Eastern Conference title? -- Arnovitz
4. Oklahoma City Thunder
Record: 37-20 (3rd in West)
The Thunder reached the All-Star break in third place out West, four games behind the Warriors. The Thunder have positioned themselves as a legitimate contender, built on the strength of a top-five defensive efficiency and two MVP-caliber team leaders, Russell Westbrook and Paul George. If defense and superstars win championships, a healthy Thunder squad is one that no one will want to face in the playoffs. -- Snellings
5. Denver Nuggets
Record: 39-18 (2nd in West)
The Nuggets reached the break with the second-best record out West, despite injuries that have seen them miss a combined 82 games from their starting five. Nikola Jokic has turned in an MVP-caliber campaign thus far, ranking third in the NBA with a Real Plus-Minus of 6.46 that has led the Nuggets to the fourth-best offensive efficiency in the league. -- Snellings
6. Philadelphia 76ers
Record: 37-21 (T-4th in East)
With the trades for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, the Sixers let it be known to the world that their aspiration this season is nothing less than the NBA Finals. If the first four games and 73 minutes their new starting lineup has played together is any indication, they have a strong case to be a favorite in the East. The Philly Phive has an eye-popping net rating of plus-24.6 points per 100 possessions. -- Arnovitz
7. Boston Celtics
Record: 37-21 (T-4th in East)
The Celtics are currently tied for fourth in the East with the 76ers, a game behind the Pacers. They are likely too far behind to catch the first-place Bucks or second-place Raptors, so their most likely scenario has them challenging for the third seed. However, they are widely considered to have one of the most talented rosters and own the third-best scoring margin (plus-6.4) in the NBA. Perhaps the best news for the Celtics is the recent play of Gordon Hayward, who has averaged 21.0 points (63.3 shooting), 4.7 assists and 4.7 rebounds during the three games leading into the break and looks like he is approaching full strength for the first time this season. -- Snellings
8. Houston Rockets
Record: 33-24 (5th in West)
James Harden is working hard to make history. Can he keep that up and have enough gas left to go deep in the playoffs? Can 33-year-old Chris Paul stay healthy and find his superstar form again? Paul also has to figure out how to best fit with Harden being so ball-dominant. One good sign: Paul is plus-52 in the past four games despite not shooting well (39 assists, five turnovers). -- MacMahon
9. Portland Trail Blazers
Record: 34-23 (4th in West)
The Blazers enter the post-All-Star break in a precarious position. Portland will have to be nearly perfect to catch up to Golden State, Denver or Oklahoma City in the top three West playoff spots. The Blazers currently own the fourth seed, which comes with home court in the first round of the playoffs. Meanwhile, Portland has four teams breathing down their necks trying to take it away. -- Spears
10. Indiana Pacers
Record: 38-20 (3rd in East)
Credit to Indiana, which has gone 13-9 without injured All-Star Victor Oladipo this season after posting an 0-7 mark in games without him in 2017-18. As a third-place team, the Pacers should still be a lock to make the playoffs in the East, even without their best player. But it'd be a huge accomplishment to somehow hold on to home-court advantage. -- Herring
11. Utah Jazz
Record: 32-25 (6th in West)
Ricky Rubio maintained his professionalism -- and sense of humor -- as the Jazz dangled him in an attempt to upgrade with Mike Conley. Utah probably needs Rubio, a free agent this summer, at his best to advance past the first round for the third straight year. The Jazz also need Dante Exum to come back strong after a long absence due to a left ankle sprain. -- MacMahon
12. San Antonio Spurs
Record: 33-26 (7th in West)
Can DeMar DeRozan get his groove back? His production and efficiency have slipped significantly since the calendar flipped to 2019, as he has dealt with fatigue and nagging injuries. The Spurs look like a good bet to extend their playoff streak to record-tying 22 years. The question is whether Spurs can do any damage once they get there. -- MacMahon
13. Los Angeles Lakers
Record: 28-29 (10th in West)
LeBron James returned more than two weeks ago, but the Lakers still find themselves slotted at No. 10 in the Western Conference playoff race. Missing the postseason would be embarrassing for the Lakers, even with the tempered expectations set at the start of the season. Qualifying won't be easy, as the upstart Kings have shown no signs of tailing off, and the resilient and transitional Clippers still able to play .500 ball or better, irrespective of who's on the roster. -- Arnovitz
14. LA Clippers
Record: 32-27 (8th in West)
The Clippers won't say it aloud, but most within the front office wouldn't mind being edged out at the finish line for a playoff spot, thus allowing them to retain their first-round draft pick this June. In the meantime, the top priority is the continuing development of rookie point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Clips would love to be able to enter free-agency pitches not only with cap space, but evidence that Gilgeous-Alexander is a point guard with the skills to lead an elite, contending team. -- Arnovitz
15. Sacramento Kings
Record: 30-27 (9th in West)
Do the Kings finally have enough to make the playoffs for the first time since 2006? Adding quality veteran forward Harrison Barnes as a starter and veteran guard Alec Burks off the bench sure showed the club is going for it this season. De'Aaron Fox has been outstanding in his second year at point guard, and perhaps it's time for the Kings to take the training wheels off talented forward Marvin Bagley III and let him start. -- Spears
16. Brooklyn Nets
Record: 30-29 (6th in East)
It's ironic that in a season the Nets finally own their first-round draft pick, they're playing their way into the postseason -- but Brooklyn will gladly take a pick in the teens in exchange for the playoff berth. Even with the Nets' recent slide, no team works harder, gets more out of its personnel and is better coached than Brooklyn. The gritty supporting cast has been a revelation, but the Nets' postseason hopes will rest in large part on the play of D'Angelo Russell, who has led the team in scoring in each of the past nine games. -- Arnovitz
17. Detroit Pistons
Record: 26-30 (T-8th in East)
Detroit won five of its last seven games before the break and enters the second half of the season in a tie for the eighth and final playoff spot. The Pistons retooled their roster some, hoping to find a bit more support for Blake Griffin, who has been great, but at times looked overburdened on offense because of the team's lack of ball handlers. At this point, with just one playoff appearance in the previous nine seasons, Detroit will take some mid-April basketball anyway it can get it. -- Herring
18. Charlotte Hornets
Record: 27-30 (7th in East)
The Hornets were gracious hosts for All-Star Weekend, but their fans are more worried about getting back to the postseason. Charlotte, however, made no significant move at the trade deadline to help its cause. The Hornets have tough competition for the final two playoff spots with Detroit, Miami and Orlando. -- Spears
19. Minnesota Timberwolves
Record: 27-30 (11th in West)
The Timberwolves desperately need to pick up some wins if they hope to make the postseason for the second year in a row. Minnesota is currently four games out of the playoff race behind the Clippers. Success would certainly help the cause for interim head coach Ryan Saunders in his hopes to be permanent. Consistent elite play from forward Andrew Wiggins to complement All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns would help, too. -- Spears
20. Orlando Magic
Record: 27-32 (10th in East)
The Magic are having a season that exceeds expectations across the board. The team was expected to be in full rebuild mode, but instead the strong play of first-time All-Star Nikola Vucevic has them entering the break a half game out of the playoffs and on a five-game winning streak. In addition, the deadline deal to bring in 2017 No. 1 overall pick Markelle Fultz gives the Magic three top-five draft picks from the past two drafts (along with Mo Bamba and Jonathan Isaac) to develop as a potential future core. -- Snellings
21. Miami Heat
Record: 26-30 (T-8th in East)
The Heat limped into the All-Star break, having lost six of their past eight games to fall into a tie for the last playoff spot. They remain one of four teams within a game of each other for seeds 7 through 10, though, and have a veteran-laden team that would like to send legend Dwyane Wade into retirement with a playoff berth. -- Snellings
22. Washington Wizards
Record: 24-34 (11th in East)
With the franchise clearly being built around Bradley Beal at this point, the next two months should be about establishing which teammates fit best alongside him for the coming years, and doing everything you can to keep Beal healthy for next season. Washington sits three games out of the No. 8 seed, so a late-season charge isn't out of the question, either. -- Herring
23. Dallas Mavericks
Record: 26-31 (12th in West)
Rookie sensation Luka Doncic will be pushed to his limits, as he has as much responsibility on his shoulders the rest of the season as anyone but a couple recent MVPs. Dorian Finney-Smith, Maxi Kleber, Jalen Brunson get extended auditions to prove they're good fits as role players who complement the kid. -- MacMahon
24. New Orleans Pelicans
Record: 26-33 (13th in West)
The rest of the season is about managing the Anthony Davis dumpster fire and figuring out who will be the Pelicans' point man in trade discussions this summer. As coach Alvin Gentry does his best to keep the Pelicans focused amid all the distractions, the league office might need to reconsider whether the franchise has the right to act in its own best interest by putting Davis on the shelf for the rest of the season. -- MacMahon
25. Atlanta Hawks
Record: 19-39 (12th in East)
There are some who would argue that the Hawks are doing themselves a disservice by winning games and decreasing their odds in the Zion Williamson sweepstakes. But Atlanta will happily take the incremental progress of its young core -- Trae Young, John Collins and Kevin Huerter most notably -- and the cultural foundation being laid down by head coach Lloyd Pierce. It's an inexperienced group that may still lose a ton of games down the stretch, but the Hawks seem to have recused themselves from the 2019 Tankathon. -- Arnovitz
26. Memphis Grizzlies
Record: 23-36 (14th in West)
Hey, hey, let's convey! Not quite an inspiring rally cry, but the Grizzlies' primary goal is to get rid of the top-eight protected pick they owe the Celtics now, not when it's top-six protected next year or unprotected in 2021. Mike Conley will surely get shopped again this summer, but he's helping mentor Jaren Jackson Jr. to be Memphis' future face of the franchise. -- MacMahon
27. Chicago Bulls
Record: 14-44 (14th in East)
The chief curiosity for Chicago heading into the second half should be seeing how Otto Porter Jr. continues to fit alongside Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen. The early results have been more than encouraging: In their 110 minutes as a trio, Chicago has outscored opponents by 14 points per 100 possessions. Seeing what that group does once Wendell Carter Jr. returns should be somewhat instructive for next year. -- Herring
28. Cleveland Cavaliers
Record: 12-46 (14th in East)
Cleveland has a handful of things to monitor once it resumes play. Can Cedi Osman, who has averaged 20 points per game over the past month or so, become a consistent second scorer going forward? Can Kevin Love, now healthy again, restore his value as a franchise-caliber player? (If not as a legitimate centerpiece, then as trade asset.) But the most important question will come in mid-May, when the Cavs have a chance to win the lottery. -- Herring
29. Phoenix Suns
Record: 11-48 (Last in West)
As bad as things seem to be for the Suns, the good news is there finally seems to be some stability. There is no potential change in head coach, general manager or even arena on the horizon and they finally have a point guard, Tyler Johnson. Don't be surprised if the Suns play the role of spoiler the rest of the regular season. Foes will take the Suns lightly, but with young stars Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton and other budding talent, they can be competitive. -- Spears
30. New York Knicks
Record: 11-47 (Last in East)
The Knicks had parlayed an impressive 18-game losing streak into the worst record in the NBA before winning the last pre-break game to move a half-game ahead of the Suns. However, under the new draft lottery rules, the teams with the three worst records share the same chance at the No. 1 overall pick. The Knicks are three full games behind the Bulls for the fourth-worst record in the league, so they have some wiggle room while continuing their season-long youth movement without fear of lowering their lottery odds. -- Snellings

26066827,"Since his college days at Texas, Tucker has been relentlessly searching for sneakers. As he told The Undefeated over All-Star Weekend,  he got his start on eBay and never looked back.
""I actually went to the bank and got a debit card so I could get an eBay account and buy shoes,"" Tucker said. ""My first debit card ... was because of eBay, so I could buy shoes.""
Though he laughs now, the passion still hasn't faded. While most assume the reigning sneaker champ has every last model he has ever wanted, they would be almost right. He recently and finally tracked down a near-mythical pair of the ""Tokyo"" Air Jordan 5 that have long evaded him, and Tucker excitedly wore them in the very first Houston Rockets game after the All-Star break.
Made in 2011 in limited quantities for the launch of Jordan Brand's T23 boutique in Tokyo, the yellow nubuck shoes were originally thought to only have released in up to a size 13. The unique negative space ""23"" logo along the heel, designed by Nike's Mark Smith, only added to the appeal.
""I've been looking for those for years!"" texted Tucker. ""They said no [size] 14s were made, but they made a couple samples and these were Ray Allen's.""

Since debuting his second Jordan signature sneaker in early January, Oklahoma City Thunder All-Star Russell Westbrook has been hijacking the main stage that is the arena entryway to unveil his latest themed editions on a nightly basis. He has coordinated a construction worker outfit with a neon and orange colorway, hauled in Super Soaker-inspired packaging for a linking colorway and even had a special ""Bear Jordan"" edition drafting off of a teddy bear and a Valentine's chocolate box.
His latest stunt featured unkempt flowing orange hair along the box lid and a design inspired by the shorts of none other than Chuckie Finster, the lovable cartoon character from the 1990s show ""Rugrats."" Westbrook later took the floor in a colorway bringing the theme full circle, with hits of orange, blue and purple throughout, and Chuckie's shorts pattern along the collar.
Fellow Jordan signature athlete Chris Paul also has been ramping up his themed colorways this season, unveiling a new pair of his eleventh model inspired by Fred Flintstone. Worn during Houston's impressive short-handed victory over the Golden State Warriors, Paul poured in 23 points with 17 assists in the black-and-orange tunic-inspired printed pair. Fred's trademark light blue tie came to life along the shoe's forefoot strap, and according to CP3, ""The Flintstones"" edition is just a taste of what's to come.
""I got some fun ones coming out around the playoffs and through the summer,"" Paul said. ""A few shoes paying homage to some of my favorite TV shows and stuff like that. I probably can't tell you everything, but we got some fun stuff coming.""
Elsewhere in the league, players got into the school spirit. Golden State All-Star Kevin Durant donned a burnt-orange pair of his KD 11s made for his beloved Texas Longhorns, while Philadelphia 76ers small forward Jimmy Butler honored Tomball High School atop the heel of his latest team Jordan sneakers. Miami Heat forward Derrick Jones Jr. broke out a rare LeBron 6 originally made for New York's Christ The King in 2008; while the Pennsylvania native didn't attend the Queens-based private school, the decade-old pair remains one of the more exclusive and rare LeBron school editions of the era.

26000179,"In the Muggsy Bogues family suite on Muggsy Bogues Night in Charlotte, North Carolina, last December, high-top tables are covered in Muggsy Bogues bobbleheads and chicken tenders, Muggsy Bogues' favorite stadium food.
Boban Marjanovic is 7-foot-3 and -- no joke! -- the most efficient scorer in NBA history. He's also a career backup. Does that bother him? Less than you'd think.
The 2019 All-Star Game saw Team LeBron rally past Team Giannis at MJ's house. Here's everything you need to know after All-Star Weekend took over Charlotte.
Step into the shoes of LeBron or Giannis and assemble your best squad to become king of All-Star Weekend.
Muggsy Bogues is downstairs, standing in a crowd near the corner of the hardwood, a few minutes away from a halftime ceremony in his honor at a game between the Hornets and Knicks at the Spectrum Center. The shortest player in NBA history, all of 5 feet, 3 inches, is closing in on 54 years old and still looks as if he can run a few fast breaks. His purple tie matches the old-school Hornets logo, and his purple-checked suit comes custom-designed from an upscale men's clothing boutique near his south Charlotte home.
Up in the family suite, another trim, 5-foot-3 man rises from his seat and wobbles a bit on his feet. His hand is shaky around a clear cup filled with golden Miller Lite. A wool hat sits high on his ears, and a cross dangles between the zippers of an open black leather jacket. He's missing his top front teeth but doesn't see much reason to replace them. He turned 60 this past September. By his math, that's nearly two more lifetimes than he expected.
Highlights from Muggsy's career flash on the big screen. There he is, spinning under elbows, lofting layups in long arches, flying past even the fastest opponents of his day, slipping passes through spaces no other player could've found. Before or since, nobody else has seen the professional game from the perspective of Tyrone ""Muggsy"" Bogues. Thirty years have come and gone since he joined a hodgepodge of expansion-draft castoffs to assemble the inaugural 1988-89 Charlotte Hornets. They finished 20-62 that season; the city threw a parade. They sold out 364 consecutive games in their first nine seasons. In Muggsy's basement today he displays a teal hardback chair from the old coliseum, signed by the city's former mayor-turned-governor Pat McCrory. ""To Muggsy,"" it says. ""You will always be number 1 in Charlotte!""
By the early 1990s, kids all over the country were finding Hornets Starter coats under Christmas trees. Muggsy was an NBA marketer's dream, a superhero for the little man, a he-did-it-so-I-can-do-it-too prototype, the point guard of a team that included other memorable characters like Larry ""Grandmama"" Johnson and Alonzo ""Zo"" Mourning. Muggsy was in ""Space Jam."" He appeared at elementary schools unannounced, dressed up for uptown balls, whatever Charlotte asked of him. If you were a child in the 1990s in Charlotte, you could stumble into your favorite NBA player anywhere, and you could hug him around the chest.
""Muggsy!"" fans near the floor shout as they reach over the railing looking for a handshake.
He has heard it everywhere he has gone for 30 years.
Muggsy!
Muggsy!
Muggsy!
But even his biggest fans rarely notice the man in the wool hat and leather jacket. They have no idea that almost 25 years ago, at the height of Muggsy Bogues' career, he saved that man's life -- and, in turn, that man saved Muggsy's.
Chuckie Bogues is Muggsy's oldest sibling, and the next line in his bio is: Chuckie Bogues hasn't done a hard drug in 23 years. In a family with plenty to be proud of, that Chuckie is even alive tonight might be their greatest accomplishment.
""If I'd stayed up there,"" Chuckie says of their hometown of Baltimore, ""I wouldn't be standing here talking.""
The tribute video ends and the announcer growls out a call for everyone in the arena to get on their feet. As the applause grows and the spotlights fix on him, it's hard to believe there was a time when Muggsy Bogues could feel lonely, a time when all he had was the man in the luxury suite looking down from the shadows.
On a warm afternoon last September, Muggsy and Chuckie are on their back patio playing dominoes and trying to explain family nicknames.
Their grandfather was Richard, but everybody called him Snook. Their father was also Richard, but everyone called him Billy. He married Elaine, who didn't want to be called Mom, so her kids called her Lainey.
Chuckie, whose real name is, get this, Richard, was first. Then came Anthony, whom everybody called Stroh. And Sherron, a girl, whom everybody called Helen. Lainey had two failed pregnancies after that, meaning that everybody doted on the fourth and final child, Tyrone, who started out as Apple but later became Muggsy.
""I can remember the first day when he was born,"" Chuckie says. ""They brought him home and they say, 'Hold him.' I was 6. And I said, 'Ohhh, my little brother.'""
They moved out of the 1035 building in the Lafayette high-rises of east Baltimore and into the low-rises across the courtyard. There they had three bedrooms: one for mom and dad, one for Helen, and one the three boys shared.

Chuckie taught his siblings how to maneuver in the city. They played card games for Now & Laters, pitched nickels and pennies for cookies. But he grew distant as a teen and was using by the time he was 15, often in the company of their father, Billy, before Billy got sent away for 20 years for armed robbery. Chuckie never quit a drug if he started it. Heroin, cocaine, ""whatever kind they waaasss,"" he says, a curtsy on the end of each sentence.
Meanwhile, his three younger siblings took to sports. Muggsy and Helen made clothes-hanger hoops, hung them on the closet door and tossed rolled-up socks through them. Muggsy's best friend Reggie Williams (everybody called him Russ) joined them, and they'd bang against the walls grabbing sock rebounds until 9 p.m., lights out.
Muggsy hated going to bed. One night when he was 5, he heard a window shatter at the bar and grill across the street. He ran downstairs. The owner -- ""Old Man Chester"" -- pulled a shotgun from his shed and fired buckshot around the low-rises at nobody in particular. Pellets hit Muggsy in the arms and legs. He woke up in the hospital.
""The expectation was that you wouldn't live past 20,"" Muggsy says, flipping over a domino.
""Mmm-hmm,"" Chuckie confirms. He's down about 45 points in the dominoes game but doesn't care. ""I never thought I would make it. Heck no. That's why I always say I'm just grateful to see one more day. That's all I can say. I saw another one. Now look. Wild horses can't grab me.""
They unreel the family story from there. Muggsy's chance to escape became clear at Dunbar High School. With him as point guard, the Poets went undefeated in back-to-back seasons and finished as one of the best high school teams of all time. When Muggsy grew too old for curfews, he practiced jumpers on the Lafayette courts until almost sunrise.
""Won't that boy go in the house and go to sleep?"" Azalia Madison remembers her stepfather yelling. She grew up in Lafayette and now lives in Charlotte, too. ""But nobody stopped him and nobody messed with him.""
Muggsy earned a scholarship to Wake Forest and set an ACC record at the time for career assists. Stroh joined the U.S. Army. He was at Fort Hood, Texas, listening to the radio the night his brother's name was called as the 12th pick in the 1987 NBA draft. Their sister, Sherron, or Helen, worked for 32 years in Baltimore's parks and recreation department. She died from lung cancer in 2015, and a year later Baltimore's mayor dedicated a day in June as Sherron Bogues Day.
But Chuckie, on the other hand?
It was 1985 or 1986, and Muggsy was home on a break from Wake Forest. As Chuckie starts to tell the story, Muggsy says, ""Oh, my goodness"" and gently slams his head on the table.
It's a payday, Chuckie says, and he walks down to sit on the wall overlooking the Inner Harbor, cash in the pockets of his new green koshi shorts and a slick pair of white Air Jordans dangling over the Patapsco River. He lights a cigarette and a young woman behind him catches his attention.
His eyes follow her, his head follows his eyes, his body follows his head, and he spins himself right off his perch.
The harbor is no YMCA swimming pool. People who fall in don't come out. More than 50 bodies have been pulled in the past 20 years. Chuckie wades for a few minutes until he sees a fireman lowering a ladder to him. He's bleeding from barbed wire, but when he's back on solid ground and looks around, he realizes he's attracted a crowd. ""I thought, 'I should jump back in,'"" he says.
He changes clothes at his mother's house, then goes to his girlfriend's place. In the stairwell there, he walks into a wall and busts open his eye. Doctors that night stretch 10 stitches across the gash.
After being discharged, he returns to his mother's house. His brothers are asleep in their old room. Chuckie, apparently not finished entertaining himself for the day, thinks it'd be fun to startle them by jumping into the top bunk. He almost makes it, but ""almost"" isn't good enough when you're jumping on a top bunk, and down comes Chuckie. He puts his hand over his other eye, pulls it away, sees blood, and heads back to the hospital.
""Mr. Bogues,"" Chuckie recalls the doctor saying, ""just go sit in the corner, and don't move.""
Muggsy remembers Chuckie walking through the door, chewing bubble gum, his Air Jordans squishy. ""And you'd ask him, 'What happened, boy?'"" Muggsy says, before delivering a pitch-perfect imitation of Chuckie's mannerisms. ""I fell in the haaaahhhbor.""
In October 1995, Muggsy received a phone call from his mother. She sounded exhausted.
""I don't know what to do with Chuckie anymore,"" Elaine Bogues said of her first-born, who was then 37 years old. No longer could anyone see the humor in Chuckie stories. He'd been arrested once, in 1993, for ""a theft scheme of more than $300."" By 1995, he was snorting cocaine so often it was hard to hold a full conversation with him.
Elaine's other children had good government jobs with benefits, but only one, the NBA star, had the space for what Chuckie needed. ""If you don't take him and move him in with you,"" she told Muggsy, ""he's going to die.""
The previous two years hadn't been easy on Muggsy. On July 27, 1993, one of his oldest friends, Boston Celtics standout and high school teammate Reggie Lewis, collapsed on a basketball court and suffered a sudden cardiac death. Eight days later, on Aug. 4, 1993, Muggsy's father, Billy, died from pneumonia in Baltimore. He'd been out of jail for a handful of years by then, but wound up using again, often with Chuckie. Muggsy delivered the eulogy, saying ""he wasn't a perfect father,"" but also going out of his way to say that Billy tried to provide for the family.
Muggsy put together two of his best seasons after that, leading the Hornets to the playoffs in 1995. He signed a contract extension and the ""Space Jam"" deal, but the bright lights concealed another tough truth: His marriage was crumbling.

Kim Bogues fell in love with Muggsy without knowing much about basketball and Muggsy's stardom. By 1995, she was a wife and mother who was tired of being alone. Even when Muggsy wasn't traveling, her stomach turned when other women -- ""groupies,"" she called them -- approached him. The couple won't go into detail about whether there was infidelity, but trust between them collapsed. That summer, she took their children, Brittney and Ty, and moved to the north Charlotte suburb of Huntersville.
After years of saying yes to Chuckie's little requests for help, Muggsy had eventually cut his oldest brother off. ""Twenty dollars or five dollars,"" Muggsy remembers. ""It wasn't like you were giving him thousands. But that 20 dollars, it did damage to him.""
Now the richest man in the family lived alone. In August 1995, he quietly went in for surgery on his left knee. He figured he'd sit out only a few weeks but wound up missing nearly the whole season. There are pains athletes talk about publicly and pains they deal with in private, and sometimes one provides just the right shade for the other. In interviews, Muggsy told reporters how hard it was to sit and watch his teammates play, not letting on about troubles at home.
Muggsy always does what his mom says. He moved Chuckie in and hid liquor bottles. He put six-packs of O'Doul's in the fridge. He checked the guest room to make it safe for rehab. He bought Chuckie a long, red robe. Some days, Muggsy opened the door to find Chuckie shaking underneath the robe. Other days, Muggsy heard him clear across the house, hollering the withdrawal out of his lungs. At a time when Muggsy couldn't fix much of anything else -- couldn't heal the knee, mend the marriage, revise his father's life, bring back Reggie -- you better believe he wasn't going to lose Chuckie.
""That was my job; that was my brother,"" Muggsy says. ""That's what family is for -- the good, bad and indifferent. That's how my mom and dad raised us.""
The first six months of rehab were brutal. Chuckie wouldn't consider a licensed treatment facility. The shivering, the crying out, that all happened in the guest room above the garage.
Muggsy lived in one house throughout his time in Charlotte. It's in a community of big homes on the southern edge of the city. It's quiet out here; to Chuckie back then, it was the boondocks. The closest grocery store was a 30-minute walk.
Chuckie kept his room cold. Every couple of hours he shuffled to a spot in the middle, figuring the farther he was away from doors and windows, the less likely anyone was to hear him scream. On the back side of the room was a balcony that overlooked an outdoor basketball court, painted in Hornets colors, where Muggsy worked out his knee and played H-O-R-S-E with an all-star list of opponents. Chuckie wandered onto the deck every now and again, his hands shaking and holding lit cigarettes.
""Dell!"" he'd shout out when Dell Curry, Muggsy's closest friend on the Hornets, missed a shot. ""You got an R!""
Muggsy didn't tell his teammates the extent of Chuckie's troubles. Some nights, he brought dinner into the room, only to come back hours later and see it unmoved, uneaten. Some nights he cleaned up Chuckie's vomit.
There were days when Muggsy questioned whether he was doing more harm than good. But he believed that forcing Chuckie into a facility would make him feel abandoned, resentful. Their mother had driven this much into them, that when nobody else can handle you, family will.
Slowly, Chuckie showed improvement. The vomiting stopped, the hollering was less frequent. One day Chuckie looked Muggsy in the eye and said, I ain't gonna mess up on you.
If all you see of Chuckie are the broken parts, you see what Muggsy could have become. If you look closer, though, you'll see how Chuckie grounded Muggsy and helped him through a correction.

From the Lafayette courts to the NBA, Muggsy had obsessed over proving people wrong about his size. He had few doubters left, especially after averaging a double-double with 10.8 points and 10.1 assists in 1993-94. He'd been profiled by most major publications, with headlines like ""Tall Ain't All"" or ""How Muggsy Overcame Long Odds."" He'd appeared in a 1993 episode of ""Saturday Night Live"" alongside Charles Barkley, Nirvana and RuPaul.
Maybe Kim was right, he began to think in those first few months watching over Chuckie. Maybe the determination that defined him was also a blinder -- she thought it morphed into cockiness. But loneliness gave him a chance to reflect on how he prioritized connections -- whether it's a sketch on SNL, an autograph for a fan, a check-in on Chuckie or the connection with Kim that he'd let slip.
They all are important in their own way, but not in the same way.
""When somebody's telling you, 'Oh, we love you. You're the greatest,' sometimes it gets to a guy's head,"" Kim says. ""[Now] he comes home and says, 'Oh, this is real s--- right here. This is reality. And nobody sees this. No one sees what I'm doing. No one sees the struggle that I'm going through.'""
He called his kids every day -- ""Not one day went by that I didn't,"" he emphasizes later. Kim, though, grew weary of being asked if she was ""Muggsy Bogues' wife."" She took the kids and moved to New York, then back to Baltimore.
Early in their marriage, Kim and Muggsy had been regular attendees at Central Church of God in south Charlotte. Muggsy returned to a regular Sunday schedule after she moved away, this time by himself. ""It's more than I can handle,"" he told God.
In 1996-97, he started to take Chuckie to practices and games. Teammates adored him. And Chuckie was good luck; the Hornets finished 54-28 that season, the best record in franchise history.
Still, Muggsy kept Chuckie out of the press. It was too soon to be certain, he says. On the other side of the curtain between his public and private lives, though, Muggsy knew how much he owed Chuckie. In that otherwise empty house during those three or four years, they each went through self-discovery.
""It was a therapy for him and for me at the same time,"" Muggsy says. ""When you're used to running a certain way, and that's no longer the case anymore, you've got to readjust.""
How many chances would you give your family? Better yet, how many chances would your family give you?
Kim Bogues remembers the first time she met Chuckie. She'd been sneaking down to Winston-Salem on weekends to see Muggsy at Wake Forest. The secret was out when she became pregnant with Brittney during Muggsy's senior year.
The first time Kim visited Muggsy's childhood home in Lafayette, Muggsy left her alone in the living room for only a minute, just enough time for Chuckie to appear.
""Who are you?"" he blurted.
""Kim,"" she said.
""Who you with?""
""I'm with Muggs.""
""Oh, that means you have money. Gimme 20 dollars.""
Kim's still waiting for him to pay her back.
After she and Muggsy divorced, Kim started a career in show business as a body extra on ""The Wire"" and soon made her way to food services on set. By the fifth and final season, she oversaw a food-production shift for the whole cast and crew. She later earned a culinary degree and became the personal chef for Julia Louis-Dreyfus on the set of ""Veep.""
Muggsy never recovered from the knee injury. A 1997 trade sent him to Golden State and he signed with Toronto, his final team, in 1999. He retired in 2001, the same year his mother died. During the moves, he'd managed to fulfill his other big promise to her, finishing his degree from Wake Forest in 1998. Four years after he retired, he took the head-coaching job of the WNBA's Charlotte Sting, but the franchise folded in 2007. Home life was steadier, though. Chuckie never left his side, moving with him to California, Canada and back to Charlotte. Muggsy and Kim agreed that a boy should live with his father; Ty moved down to finish high school in Charlotte. Muggsy settled down with a girlfriend, Sharon Smith. They dated for about six years and were considering marriage when doctors told Smith she had breast cancer. She died in 2009.
""It screwed me up badly,"" Muggsy says. Ty drifted while his dad mourned. By his senior year, Ty realized his future wasn't as a basketball player. He told his father he didn't want to live with him anymore.
Kim was in New York when a call came in that Ty was in trouble. He'd been in a car with friends and an open container. The prosecutor in juvenile court recognized the name on the docket and pulled Muggsy and Kim to the side. He said he'd meet with Ty, give him a little ""scared-straight"" talk, then have two deputies walk him out of the building in handcuffs. Only, they'd walk him to Muggsy and Kim's car and let them take it from there.
Chastened, Muggsy asked Kim if she would stay to help raise their son. Kim gave up her Upper East Side apartment and moved back to Charlotte. Ty's grades improved, and a decade later he works in marketing for the Hornets and helps his sister with her public relations firm. After Ty graduated, Muggsy and Kim began to date again.
Muggsy rebuilt other bridges to his past. He spent 15 years livid at former Hornets owner George Shinn for trading him and moving the franchise to New Orleans. But in 2013, a local magazine published an oral history of the inaugural team for the Hornets' 25th anniversary. Shinn and Bogues agreed to take part in a photo shoot. It was the first time they'd seen each other since 1997. They embraced and stood back-to-back for the cover. They started calling each other every few weeks and Muggsy rekindled his relationship with the Hornets, now owned by his ""Space Jam"" co-star Michael Jordan, eventually taking on an official role as the team's ambassador.
But there remained one more broken circle: Muggsy and Kim planned to remarry, but they didn't know when. They even had a marriage certificate. But Kim's work on the set of ""Veep"" kept her too busy to think about it -- or so she wanted him to believe.
On Jan. 9, 2015, Muggsy's 50th birthday, the couple dressed up for an uptown dinner. Kim convinced him to stop by a friend's apartment in high-rise building to pick up a gift. He opened the door to a 50th-floor lounge overlooking the city to cheers from his family, Kim's family, all their friends.
They chanted.
Muggsy.
Muggsy.
Muggsy.
But this wasn't just a surprise birthday party. It was a surprise wedding.
Kim and Brittney had been planning it for more than seven months. A pastor turned the corner and the couple exchanged vows right there, sniffles and tears all around the room as Muggsy promised to be a better husband than he was before.
""We started this thing a long time ago, before we even had anything,"" Muggsy said in his vows, captured on video. ""I'm just so thankful. Many people don't get this opportunity a second time around."" Rewind the video of Muggsy's entrance that night and standing in the doorway behind him is Chuckie, wearing a shirt and tie and the wool hat over his ears.
""He's always invisible,"" Kim says, ""but he's always there.""
Now look out on the floor at center court. Muggsy's three children are there -- Ty and Brittney from his marriage with Kim; Tyisha from a relationship before he met Kim -- and Tyisha's two children, Samartine and Taniya. There's Kim Bogues, in purple lipstick. If you'd told her 10 years ago she'd be here tonight, she says she'd have given you, direct quote, ""a right hook."" Now? ""Never say what you're never gonna do,"" she says.
Before the festivities of Muggsy Bogues Night, Chuckie drinks a couple of beers and plays Wii bowling with Kim's mom. Alcohol remains a crutch, but he has days when he drinks nothing at all. That's progress. The rest of the afternoon he horses around with his great-nephew and plays with the family dog, a year-old black lab mix whose full name is Dunbar Billy Bogues.
Chuckie had a stroke about a decade ago. It erased some short-term memory and made him unbalanced on his feet. Each time Chuckie goes with his brother to a game, Chuckie introduces himself to concessions workers as if it's the first time they've met.
""I have the easiest goddamn life in the world,"" Chuckie says. He has settled into an informal caretaker role around the house. He mops the floors and takes out the trash every Monday. He picks up sticks around the yard, cooks dinner on occasion, waits for UPS deliveries.
""I'm just enjoying my family,"" he says. ""I don't want jack for s--- anyway. Just to see them happy, just like this. If I wake up tomorrow morning, I don't give a hell if they got a hurricane shaking, I had a good day.""
Chuckie's background on his cellphone is a picture of his great-nephew. He's the one who reminds Muggsy to call loved ones on their anniversaries and birthdays. Stripped of all material worries, Chuckie lines up his priorities as such: (1) family; (2) everything else. And in a roundabout way, during those hard days in 1995, he reminded his famous brother to do the same.
During the halftime ceremony, Muggsy receives a key to the city. He is, once again, the center of attention. He still appreciates moments like this, but he doesn't necessarily need them like he used to, back when his home was empty.
Kim has a new appreciation too. For Muggsy's birthday this year the family flew to New York and caught ""Wicked"" on Broadway. During the show, Kim noticed cast members' subtle facial expressions when they saw Muggsy in the front row. ""When I'm with him and I see people do that I'm like, How do you do it?"" Kim says. ""It's priceless.""
Muggsy takes the microphone at center court with his wife, children and grandchildren on the floor behind him, and 20 friends and family members whooping in the luxury box.
He starts by thanking God, and he's prepared his next line: ""As a kid growing up in the inner city of Baltimore, all I wanted to do was play basketball."" But along the route from God to Baltimore in this speech, Muggsy chokes up. He lowers the microphone from his lips. The applause builds and builds.
Muggsy.
Muggsy.
Muggsy.
Kim looks up at the video board as her husband wipes his eyes. Hers are watery, too. Muggsy says later that the tears are from his mom and his sister in heaven.
The cheers in the arena drown out something Muggsy can't hear but should, another message coming from above, this one all the way from the family luxury suite, where the man in the shadows hollers from his tiptoes, voice pitching higher and higher, ""MY BIG LITTLE BROTHER!""

26125355,"SALT LAKE CITY -- Donovan Mitchell was not sure if an evening that included a career high in points, a win over the best-ranked team in the league and a Gatorade shower amounted to the best game of his career.
On Saturday night, the second-year guard finished with 46 points, including two clutch 3-pointers down the stretch and a pair of free throws late in the fourth quarter that solidified the Utah Jazz's 115-111 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.
Mitchell was the first Jazz player with a 45-point regulation season game since Karl Malone in 1998.
Will the Lakers make the playoffs? Kevin Pelton breaks down the tightest races.
Still, Mitchell was not sure. It certainly wasn't the best game of his career, he said. He could think of more potent performances that he had during the playoffs last season.
But in the regular season?
""In the regular season, I would say yes,"" Mitchell said.
The game didn't start pretty for Utah.
With Malcolm Brogdon, Eric Bledsoe, Sterling Brown and George Hill all out for the Bucks with a myriad of aches and injuries, coach Mike Budenholzer rolled out one of the largest lineups of the millennium. According to ESPN Stats & Information research, Budenholzer's lineup that included four players who measure 6-foot-10 or taller was the tallest starting lineup since 2003.
""It threw me off,"" Mitchell said of the ""MegaBucks."" ""I think it threw a lot of us off.""
The discombobulation that Mitchell described is part of what allowed the Bucks to open the game on an 11-0 run. The new-look Bucks bamboozled Rudy Gobert, who finished with the worst plus-minus (-36) in a win since the NBA began tracking plus-minus 20 years ago.
""I just got my ass beat,"" Gobert said with a shrug after the game.
After building a 20-6 lead in the first quarter, Milwaukee began to sputter, narrowly hanging on to the lead at the end of the first quarter.
The Jazz were able to regain control of the game, and their seven-point halftime lead ballooned to a 17-point lead with just under 10 minutes remaining. Entering Saturday night's game, teams that trailed by 17 in the fourth quarter this season were 3-400.
""Then we came back with our own push,"" Mitchell said. ""We realized they're 6-foot-10, but they can't run. They got the height, but we can outrun them. I think that is really what got us going.""
From that point until the final buzzer, Mitchell made more field goals by himself (7-of-10) than the Bucks did as a team (6-of-20). The Jazz went on to outscore the Bucks 42-21 in the final 9:39 of regulation, and Mitchell finished with 19 fourth-quarter points.
""Donovan was special today,"" Kyle Korver said. ""He hit amazing shots, clutch shots, tough shots.""
Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way for the Bucks with 43 points and 14 rebounds on the second night of a back-to-back.
Perhaps it wasn't the most dominant game of Mitchell's career, but he is certain about one thing: ""I'm framing the game ball.""
"
26230051,"WHEN JARRETT ALLEN wants to wind down after a game, he usually slips out of Barclays Center and makes the 30-minute walk to his Brooklyn home.
But with his 6-foot-11 frame and signature Afro, the Brooklyn Nets' second-year center is easy to identify. So what Allen calls his ""me time"" is sometimes interrupted by patrons in bars and restaurants along the route.
""You can hear them yelling, 'Oh, that's Jarrett Allen!'"" he says with a grin. ""But you just keep walking and ignore it.""
This season, one viral moment made it clear that his ""me time"" during those walks home from the arena would be harder and harder to come by.
""When I blocked LeBron,"" Allen says, ""that's when [everything] blew up.""
Allen's defense at the rim this season -- against LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden and anyone else who has challenged him -- is one of many reasons why people around the NBA are taking notice of Brooklyn's resurgence.
After averaging 23 wins over the past three years, the Nets -- led by Allen, young guards D'Angelo Russell, Caris LeVert, Spencer Dinwiddie and a strong supporting cast -- enter Wednesday's game against the Oklahoma City Thunder in sixth place in the Eastern Conference standings.
Maybe Allen adds to his list of rejected All-Stars with a block of Russell Westbrook or Paul George. Or maybe he gets dunked on. He's OK with either; Allen isn't afraid of ending up on YouTube for a block attempt gone wrong.
""Either way, you're going to be on the highlight [when you try to block a dunk],"" Allen says. ""If you go up and block it, you'll be on the highlight. If you go up and get dunked on, you'll be on the highlight. Just go up and protect the rim.""
ALL THAT'S LEFT for Rondae Hollis-Jefferson to do is pray.
LeBron had just gone to his left to beat the Nets forward off the dribble, ready to elevate and throw down his signature right-handed slam for his first points of the night.
Hollis-Jefferson knows Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson won't be happy if the Los Angeles Lakers superstar finishes the play with an easy dunk less than two minutes into the first quarter. So Hollis-Jefferson turns around, hoping to see his center somewhere near the rim as James switches hands and gathers himself 4 feet from the basket.
How Brooklyn's rising star took matters into his own hands.
""When I turned and I see J about to jump, I was like, 'Please block it,'"" Hollis-Jefferson says. ""Because if not, you'll be on the top 10.""
Allen, positioned in the paint, reads James' body language and knows that he's looking to finish with a highlight.
""You can tell when any player is gathering to go and dunk it. ... You can see [LeBron] brings it back a little bit when he goes up,"" Allen says.
So the 20-year-old slides to his right, loads up and meets James at the rim, bracing for impact with the 260-pound forward. ""People don't know how powerful his dunks are,"" Allen says.
They don't find out on that December night in Brooklyn, as Allen rises roughly a foot above the rim to reject the king.
LeBron James drives the lane and reaches back for a one-handed jam, but Jarrett Allen doesn't back down, meeting him with an emphatic rejection.
""As I saw it, really he came down the lane [so I went] up to contest the shot,"" Allen says. ""Just, you know, it's LeBron.""
The ball careens off the backboard and Allen ends up on the ground, not immediately realizing the impact of the moment about to take over social media.
""But then you hear the crowd's reaction,"" Allen says. ""And then what really gets you is you hear them start yelling again when they show the replay.""
Hours later, Allen finds out that he had become just the eighth player to block the four-time MVP, who has more than 1,800 dunk attempts in his career.
""That's a hell of a list to be on,"" Allen says.
""Growing up ... everyone would say, 'Are you going to jump when LeBron's coming at you?' I was like 13 years old [at the time]. That's the opportunity right there.""
This season, Allen has had plenty of opportunities to meet some of the NBA's biggest stars at the rim:
Oct. 17: Allen wasted no time getting on the board with this block of Blake Griffin, who was ready to add Allen to his mixtape on opening night.
Dec. 29: Allen turned an Antetokounmpo Eurostep into a highlight block when he met the Greek Freak at the rim in a game in Milwaukee. Allen denied Giannis again when the Bucks came to Brooklyn.
Jan. 2: After feeling the wrath of an Anthony Davis dunk in their previous meeting, Allen denied The Brow twice at the rim when the Nets faced the Pelicans in Brooklyn.
Jan. 16: Allen couldn't stop Harden from extending his 30-point streak, but he sure ended any attempt at a highlight-reel dunk at the end of the first half in Houston.
""For people to keep going down there and trying him, I think that's what they're supposed to do,"" Russell says. ""But the percentages aren't that successful.""
Allen has blocked 15 dunks this season, two behind JaVale McGee's league-leading total. Allen ranks 12th in blocks per game and is among the game's top rim defenders, holding opponents to a shooting percentage that is in the 75th percentile of players who defend at least three shots at the rim per game.
""He's in that elite category,"" Nets forward Ed Davis says.
ALLEN DOESN'T REMEMBER the name Frederic Weis, but he has seen the footage of Vince Carter's iconic dunk from the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. The way Allen sees it, the risk of ending up on the wrong end of a viral highlight is the cost of being a shot-blocker in the NBA.
""Nobody likes getting dunked on,"" Allen says, but what separates him as a rim protector, teammates and coaches say, is his lack of concern over the public scorn that comes with being on the wrong end of a dunk.
""People call it a business decision. I don't think about that,"" Allen says. ""I know my role on the team is to be a rim protector. So I'm going to sacrifice for the team.""
The Nets value that approach.
""There's no bravado,"" Atkinson says of Allen. ""He's not Dikembe [Mutombo, wagging his finger]. His personality is such that he doesn't take [getting dunked on] personally and he goes back at it again.""
Adds Davis: ""That's half the battle. A lot of guys don't want to be embarrassed. But if you're a shot-blocker, that's what comes with it. Sometimes you're going to be on SportsCenter. But when you have that 'I don't give a f---' attitude, most of the time you come out on the better end.""
Selected 22nd overall in 2017 with the pick the Nets acquired via trade from the Washington Wizards, Allen has come out on the better end of many highlights at the rim this season. But he also has shown that he's more than just a shot-blocker.
In addition to his blocks per game (1.5), Allen has increased his scoring (11.2 PPG) and rebounding (8.5 RPG) in his second season, flashing an ability to finish with both hands -- and through contact -- around the basket. And Atkinson believes, in time, Allen can be a true threat from the perimeter.
""You're going to see in two, three years he's Al Horford-ish,"" says Atkinson, who worked with Horford during his time with the Atlanta Hawks.
Davis sees similar potential, which is why he believes Allen could one day be one of the highest-paid players at his position.
""I think he's a $100 million player,"" Davis says. ""I don't just throw that out there and say that about anybody. He's got all the tools, he's got the work ethic. Everything is going to fall in place.""
It's not hard to see a nine-figure contract in Allen's future. Clint Capela, Rudy Gobert, Steven Adams -- players of a similar profile -- have all inked sizeable extensions in recent seasons.
""He can certainly be in that class of big men,"" one Eastern Conference executive says.
And if that comes to fruition -- and Allen becomes the backbone of a contender in Brooklyn -- some talent evaluators may have to explain their pre-draft analysis of the center to their bosses. Before the 2017 draft, some teams questioned the Austin, Texas, native's dedication to the game. ""That not loving basketball [label] is B.S.,"" Atkinson says.
Allen believes it was due, in part, to his off-court interests, which include computer engineering (one of his current hobbies is fooling around with a Raspberry Pi, a single-board computer). ""I'm not going to hold back myself from enjoying other things publicly,"" Allen says. ""I'm not going to hide that.""
Teams also asked Allen in pre-draft interviews if he'd have the courage to try to block dunk attempts from stars like James and Antetokounmpo -- a question that's typical in these settings. He heard the same question from his youth coaches in Texas. And his answer has always been the same:
""'Are you going to jump with all of the high-flyers?'"" Allen says. ""I kept telling them, 'Yeah I will.'
""I think they didn't believe me.""
They do now. Over the past few months, Allen has showed those coaches, executives -- and anyone else watching -- that he can win the midair battles against some of the league's best.
But he may need to find another way to unwind after a game in Brooklyn. Since his block party started, Allen has been recognized a bit too often, ending any chances at a peaceful trek back to his apartment.
""No more walks home,"" he says, smiling.

26234766,"Allen, now an assistant coach with the Boston Celtics, pleaded guilty in October to accepting an $18,000 bribe from the man in 2014.
The $300,000 total wasn't disclosed until Allen testified during the $450 million Medicare and Medicaid fraud case involving Philip Esformes, a Miami nursing home mogul.
According to Allen's testimony, which was reported on by Law360.com, Allen also testified that former Penn assistant Ira Bowman, who is currently on Auburn's coaching staff, had knowledge of the scheme and became involved after Allen was forced to resign as the Quakers' coach in March 2015.
Allen told the jury he set up a separate bank account for Esformes to wire him money and gave Bowman a debit card to access the funds.
Allen testified that he trained Esformes' son, Morris, in basketball during several trips to Miami, in which Esformes paid for Allen to stay in beachfront hotels, ride in limousines and attend Miami Heat games.
After the workouts, Esformes handed him plastic bags filled with about $10,000 in cash, Allen told the jury, according to Law360.com. Esformes told Allen his son's dream was to attend Penn and play basketball for the Quakers. If Allen made that happen, Esformes told him, they would be ""family for life.""
""The one thing I take seriously is when I extend myself to someone, and if they tell me we're family for life, I take it seriously,"" Allen told the jury. ""I took it to mean he was going to make sure I was going to be taken care of, as well.""
Allen said he didn't believe Morris Esformes was good enough to play basketball at Penn.
""I just didn't think he was good enough,"" Allen said. ""He was 5-foot-8, wasn't overly athletic. He could handle the ball fairly well, and in my opinion at that time, he wasn't good enough to help our program win.""
In the fall of 2014, Allen still put Morris Esformes on a list of priority recruits and slotted him for one of two spots for admission at the prestigious Wharton School of Business.
Morris Esformes is currently a senior at Penn, though he has never played for the Quakers.
Allen faces 10 years in prison, although he is expected to receive a much lighter sentence in exchange for his cooperation. He must repay the $18,000 in bribes and also pay a $200,000 fine.
""I failed on many levels,"" Allen said in a statement in October. ""Primarily, I had a failure of character. I did not live up to the high standards I set for myself, or were expected of me in the position that I held.
""I am heartbroken that my players -- current and former -- will know that I broke the law. But, I do hope that some good may come out of this.""
Bowman, a former Providence and Penn player and the 1995-96 Ivy League Player of the Year, was hired as an Auburn assistant in July.
Former Tigers assistant Chuck Person was arrested in September 2017 in a federal bribery case involving college basketball corruption. Person is scheduled for trial in New York in June.
In a statement to the Philadelphia Inquirer on Monday, Penn athletics officials said: ""We were extremely disappointed to learn that Jerome Allen, former head men's basketball coach at Penn, accepted payments to recruit a potential student-athlete to Penn and concealed that conduct from the Athletic Department and University administration.
""Until Jerome's testimony last week, we also were unaware that former assistant men's basketball coach Ira Bowman had any relevant knowledge of the matter. The University has been cooperating fully with the government and the NCAA so that the matter is appropriately redressed.""

26175088,"The club says the injury was confirmed by an MRI on Thursday, a day after Holiday played 32 minutes and scored 16 points in New Orleans' 114-104 loss to Utah.
Holiday has been the Pelicans' second-leading scorer this season, averaging 21.2 points to go with 7.7 assists, five rebounds and 1.6 steals per game in 67 games. He also is New Orleans' top perimeter defender.
Holiday and forward Julius Randle have been the Pelicans' most productive players since Anthony Davis demanded a trade in late January and subsequently had his playing time scaled back.

26176176,"LOS ANGELES -- With the Lakers all but officially out of playoff contention -- trailing the Western Conference's No. 8 seed LA Clippers by 6½ games with 17 left to play -- the team is making plans to scale back LeBron James' minutes to close out the season.
""I will be monitoring his workload from here on out,"" Lakers coach Luke Walton told ESPN on Thursday.
The 34-year-old James played 31 minutes, nearly five less than his season average, in the Lakers' loss to Denver on Wednesday. The Lakers (30-35) have lost four in a row and eight of their last 10.
The  Lakers won't fine or discipline point guard Rajon Rondo for choosing to sit away from his teammates during a loss to the Nuggets Wednesday night, sources tell ESPN's Dave McMenamin.
The four-time MVP signed a long-term contract with the Lakers in the summer of 2018, and Walton stayed focused on the long view with James from the very start.
""We've got four years,"" Walton said during the preseason. ""We want to make sure we're not only playing at our best come the end of the season but that he's fresh. And that's a goal for us. And it's a goal that we're on a journey, and it's not a one-year journey. We're continuing to try to and be our best season by season, but also as each one goes on.""
James is averaging 35.6 minutes per game this season, tying a career low for the 16-year veteran.
Despite the plan in place to protect him, James suffered a slight tear in his left groin on Christmas Day, causing him to miss 18 games as L.A. plummeted from the No. 4 record in the West to out of the playoff picture.
A source close to James told ESPN that the team is looking at a 32-minute limit, but that will be an advisement, not a hard limit. James will have the leeway to play longer to finish out a competitive game should he choose, rather than be controlled by a hard cap.
After Tuesday's loss to the Clippers, James indicated that monitoring his playing time would be a possibility moving forward, but he rejected the idea of shutting himself down for the remaining month of the schedule.
""That would take a lot of convincing from Luke [Walton] on up,"" James told ESPN, as most likely everyone from general manager Rob Pelinka to president Magic Johnson to governor Jeanie Buss would need to sign off. ""Unless I'm hurt, I'm not sitting games.""
The Lakers have three remaining back-to-backs on the schedule, and James' participation in those games will be determined in large part by his athletic trainer, Mike Mancias, who will evaluate James and recommend to the front office whether the All-Star forward will be available or not, a source close to James told ESPN.
If the Lakers miss the postseason as expected, James' string of 13 straight playoff appearances (and eight straight NBA Finals berths) will be snapped, setting up the longest offseason James will have experienced since he was 21.

26241791,"The Utah Jazz permanently banned the fan who had a heated exchange with Oklahoma City Thunder star Russell Westbrook on Monday night, saying in a statement that ""there is no place in our game for personal attacks or disrespect.""
The NBA, meanwhile, fined Westbrook $25,000 ""for directing profanity and threatening language to a fan.""
""Everyone deserves the opportunity to enjoy and play the game in a safe, positive and inclusive environment,"" Jazz president Steve Starks said in a statement Tuesday. ""Offensive and abusive behavior does not reflect the values of the Miller family, our organization and the community. We all have a responsibility to respect the game of basketball and, more importantly, each other as human beings. This has always been a hallmark of our incredible fan base and should forever be our standard moving forward.""
National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts told The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears that, ""we should all insist that a zero-tolerance policy needs to be implemented at arenas in the face of misconduct by fans. Players don't have the luxury of being able to unilaterally ban unruly fans from the arenas a la James Dolan. The arenas, therefore, have to do a better job of insulating our players.""
Multiple Jazz players, including franchise cornerstones Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell, publicly supported Westbrook on Tuesday.
Video of the Thunder guard saying, ""I'll f--- you up"" to Jazz fan Shane Keisel and his female companion while standing near the end of the OKC bench during the second quarter went viral after being posted on Twitter. Westbrook said after the Thunder's 98-89 win that it was an emotional reaction to Keisel telling him, ""Get on your knees like you're used to,"" a comment Westbrook considered ""completely disrespectful"" and ""racial.""
Russell Westbrook said he would rough up a fan and his wife during the Thunder's win in Utah, an exchange caught on video by a reporter and posted to Twitter.
""I am personally hurt by the incident at the game on March 11th,"" Mitchell said in a statement. ""As a black man living in a community I love, and playing on a team that gives me the opportunity to live out my dreams, this incident hits close to home. Racism and hate speech hurts us all, and this is not the first time something like this has happened in our arena. The Utah that I have come to love is welcoming and inclusive and last night's incident is not indicative of our fanbase. We don't want to create a negative reputation for athletes who potentially may want to come to Utah.
""I want to thank my team and the NBA for quickly responding to this hateful incident, and for helping to make our arena a place where all fans and players are welcome. I join other players in calling for all teams to take a stand. We should not be subject to hate speech or racist acts at any time, and definitely not in our arenas.
""Over the coming months I will work with the team, my teammates and the league to help make our arenas and our communities more inclusive and welcoming. That includes bans on hate speech and racism.""
Keisel, who was one of several fans who received a warning card for violating the NBA's fan code of conduct, denied saying anything inappropriate, claiming that he told Westbrook to ""Ice those knees up!"" According to Keisel, after Westbrook replied that it was heat on his knees, Keisel hollered, ""You're going to need it."" Keisel said his girlfriend, Jennifer Huff, didn't participate in the exchange.
Thunder reserves Raymond Felton and Patrick Patterson confirmed Westbrook's side of the story. Sources told ESPN that the Jazz gathered intelligence Monday that also verified Westbrook's version.
Gobert said he did not think the comment was representative of the Jazz fan base, saying he has never heard a racist comment made at Vivint Arena in his six seasons with the franchise. However, Gobert said he has been bothered in the past by disrespectful comments made toward opponents and sympathized with Westbrook.
""We have his back,"" Gobert told ESPN. ""As much as I like to compete against Russ -- and there's always a little trash talk between me and him -- as a human being, I feel for him and I understand his reaction.
""Those types of comments being made to any human being, whether it's a player or a fan in the stands or anyone, there's no room for that. Whatever is said to Russ is like it's being said to me, as a black man. Any fan in this arena represents the Jazz and the state of Utah and has to be held accountable. Like Donovan said, we're going to do our best with the Jazz and the great owners we have to make sure there's a great conversation between us and our community. I think it can be the start of something that opens people's minds and does a lot of good.""
Gobert said he was also bothered when Westbrook was touched by a boy sitting courtside in Denver last month. Westbrook responded by briefly lecturing the boy and addressing his father and told reporters postgame that fans had ""too much leeway,"" a point on which Gobert agrees.
""Sometimes it almost feels like a zoo,"" Gobert told ESPN. ""People pay money to watch us and feel like they can touch us or do whatever they want. Because we make millions, we're just expected to shut up and take it. But they can't do whatever they want.
""It's really important that we hold those people accountable, because at the end of the day, those kids are the future of this country and the future of the world. We have to show them what's right.""
Jazz reserve forward Thabo Sefolosha also expressed support for Westbrook, his teammate for five seasons.
""I stand 100% with Russell Westbrook on what happened in yesterday's game,"" Sefolosha said in an Instagram post. ""I love our fans but there are limits that can not be crossed! Support and cheer for your team and enjoy the action but fans like Shane Keisel, who use that platform to spur [their] hateful and racist views need to be held accountable.""

26051817,"LOS ANGELES -- After fouling out in a 111-106 loss to the Lakers, James Harden declared that referee Scott Foster ""for sure"" has a ""personal"" issue with the Houston Rockets and should not be allowed to officiate any more of their games.
Harden was called for four offensive fouls in the loss Thursday at Staples Center, including the call that disqualified him from the game with 1:24 left and the Rockets trailing by six points. That call was made by referee Michael Smith, but it was Foster, the crew chief, who was the target of Harden's wrath.
This Lakers win was a welcome relief after the drama that has consumed the team.
Terrence Jones, a former Rockets forward who has been dominating the G League this season, will sign a 10-day contract with the team, league sources told ESPN.
""Scott Foster, man. I never really talk about officiating or anything like that, but just rude and arrogant,"" said Harden, who finished with 30 points to extend his streak of 30-point performances to 32 games, the second longest in NBA history. ""I mean, you aren't able to talk to him throughout the course of the game, and it's like, how do you build that relationship with officials? And it's not even that call [on the sixth foul]. It's just who he is on that floor.
""It's pretty frustrating. And I'm probably going to get hit [with a fine], but honestly, I don't really say anything. I'm a pretty quiet guy, to myself, but it's one of those things where you can't voice your opinion. You can't have a conversation with someone that's officiating the game. You're getting a tech. It's pretty sad.""
This marks the second consecutive season that a Rockets star has publicly called out Foster, a 25-year NBA veteran who was voted as the league's worst referee in a 2016 poll of players and coaches conducted by the Los Angeles Times.
In January of last season, Chris Paul sarcastically referred to Foster as ""the man"" and ""who they pay to see"" after being given a technical foul late in a win over the Portland Trail Blazers. Paul also complained about Foster's unwillingness to communicate with players. The league office did not announce a fine for Paul because of the comments.
Paul also fouled out in Thursday's loss to the Lakers and was called for a technical foul by Foster with 33 seconds left when he disputed a foul on him called by Foster on a Brandon Ingram drive.
""I don't know what else to do, know what I mean?"" Paul said, referring to his poor relationship with Foster. ""I met with the league with him before and all this stuff. I don't know what else to do.""
Foster called only two of the fouls against Harden, but both occurred at critical times. Foster whistled Harden for his third foul with 3:51 left in the first quarter, ruling that the reigning MVP pushed off against Kentavious Caldwell-Pope near half court and forcing coach Mike D'Antoni to substitute for Harden earlier than usual. Foster also called Harden for his fifth foul on a charge with 2:47 left and the Rockets down two points.
According to ESPN Stats & Information, Foster issued 18 fouls (personal or technical) in Thursday's game -- 12 against the Rockets and six against the Lakers. Seven of the fouls against the Rockets occurred in the fourth quarter.
Harden, who committed half of his eight turnovers on offensive fouls, said he was bothered more by Foster's attitude than by any particular call.
""I don't really talk about officials or anything, but I think him in particular, he's different,"" said Harden, who was 11-of-24 from the field and scored only four points on 2-of-7 shooting in the fourth quarter.
The Rockets blew a 19-point lead in the second half against the Lakers, suffering their third loss in four games. Houston did not attempt a free throw in the final 20 minutes of the game, compared to 17 free throws for the Lakers during that span.
That added fuel to the fire as far as the Rockets' belief that Foster has a vendetta against them.
Harden mentioned that Foster officiated two of the Rockets' losses to the Golden State Warriors in last season's Western Conference finals. Foster also officiated the Rockets' lone loss to the Utah Jazz in the West semifinals.
In addition, Foster was the crew chief the last time that Harden fouled out, in a Dec. 22, 2017, loss to the LA Clippers.
""It's lingering, and it's something that has to be looked at for sure,"" Harden said. ""For sure, it's personal. For sure. I don't think he should be able to even officiate our games anymore, honestly.""

26057739,"TORONTO -- The cheers came in waves.
One after another, they cascaded over Friday's sellout crowd at Scotiabank Arena, crashing onto the court and washing over DeMar DeRozan. For 108 straight seconds, Toronto showered DeRozan with every ounce of love and respect he had earned from the city over his nine seasons with the franchise, acknowledging what everyone here has always been ready to admit:
This was a moment neither side wanted to happen.
Not the fans in Toronto, who watched a kid from Compton, California, grow up to become Canada's favorite son. And certainly not DeRozan, who not only wasn't interested in leaving Toronto, he still is open about how much he loves the place.
Yet here they both were, brought together again for one surreal night in which DeRozan, despite playing in San Antonio Spurs colors, was treated like he was still wearing a Raptors jersey.
""It's an honor,"" DeRozan would say later. ""To come back and get a reception like that, it's definitely humbling, beyond gratifying, and I appreciate it.""
When asked how it measured up to the way DeRozan described his feelings about coming back here -- comparing it to breaking up with a longtime girlfriend -- he smiled.
""Yeah,"" DeRozan said. ""You're like, 'Damn, she's still fine as hell.'""
The Toronto crowd gives DeMar DeRozan a standing ovation after the Raptors show a video tribute thanking him for his time with the franchise.
Sports are a funny thing. None of those 20,058 fans who stood and cheered for DeRozan would argue that he is a better player than Kawhi Leonard, the man he was traded for last summer. Neither would the Raptors -- or, frankly, the Spurs themselves.
But sports, and the fandom that drives them, are rarely based in logic and reason. And it is that general lack of either that made DeRozan's departure this past summer so difficult for so many here to digest.
Toronto is a world-class city, a sprawling metropolis on the northwest shores of Lake Ontario that is one of North America's largest urban centers. But as the only international team in the NBA, the Raptors and their fans still -- at times -- have the mentality of a team playing in one of the league's smallest markets, as opposed to one of its biggest. There is a constant, collective feeling of this franchise, and this city, having a chip on its shoulder and a need to prove its worth to the rest of the basketball world.
The love here for DeRozan stems from those same feelings. When he arrived here in 2009, the Raptors were at a low ebb. A few years earlier, Vince Carter -- the one truly transcendent star the team had in its brief existence -- had forced his way out of town in excruciatingly ugly fashion. A year after DeRozan's arrival, Chris Bosh would leave as a free agent to join forces with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in Miami.
There were real doubts at that point if any star player would be willing to put down roots in Toronto over the long haul -- as well as if the Raptors, who to that point had won just a single playoff series, could ever become a legitimate NBA force.
DeRozan, by virtue of both his own individual improvement and the team's steady climb to relevance, became the face of a Raptors squad that quieted those doubters.
Executive produced by Kevin Durant, The Boardroom explores the most fascinating trends and innovative endeavors across the business of sports, featuring conversations with athletes, executives and business titans. Watch on ESPN+
Suddenly, a franchise that had made the playoffs only five times in its first 18 seasons in existence made it five in a row and advanced in the postseason in each of the final three. Over his nine years in Toronto, DeRozan became the face of Canadian basketball as the country began producing precocious young talents at an ever-accelerating rate -- young players who grew up rooting for DeRozan and his Raptors.
At the same time, DeRozan went from a player whom Toronto was questioned for inking to a four-year, $40 million contract extension in 2012 to one who, by the time he could be a free agent again in 2016, was a clear max-level player.
And it was then, in the summer of 2016, when the bond between DeRozan and Toronto was forever cemented. DeRozan, a 6-foot-6 shooting guard from metropolitan Los Angeles who went to USC, had grown up idolizing Kobe Bryant. That summer, Bryant retired, leaving the Los Angeles Lakers with both the max cap space and the starting shooting guard spot available for DeRozan to serve as Bryant's replacement.
Only DeRozan didn't replace him. In fact, he didn't even think about it. Instead, he agreed to return to the Raptors without even taking a meeting from the Lakers -- or anyone else.
For a franchise that had spent so long waiting for such a moment -- for a star to choose to stay in Toronto, to willingly want to be there -- it forever cemented DeRozan's place in the hearts of every member of this fan base.
""It was amazing,"" said Kyle Lowry, who spent six seasons as DeRozan's teammate. ""The fans are awesome, and the city was awesome.""
Still, that love didn't mean that logic was completely absent from this night. When Friday's game boiled down to the final minutes, becoming a back-and-forth affair anyone could win, fans' traditional allegiances took hold.
So, when Leonard buried a huge turnaround jumper over DeRozan in the closing minutes, the fans burst into cheers. And when DeRozan got trapped at midcourt by Leonard and Lowry with 20 seconds to go, losing the ball and allowing Leonard to go the other way for an uncontested dunk to give Toronto the lead, they cheered louder. Then when DeRozan passed up a chance to take the potential game winner and gave the ball to Davis Bertans, who missed, they cheered even louder.
Finally, when Toronto escaped with a 120-117 victory, they cheered louder still.
Ultimately, for all the love fans have for the players while wearing the jerseys of their favorite teams, sports are about the laundry -- not the people wearing it. And on this night, DeMar DeRozan played here for the first time in a jersey with something other than Raptors across his chest.
So, in the end, DeRozan going home as a loser was -- for the first time here -- an acceptable outcome.
DeMar DeRozan received two standing ovations from a grateful Toronto crowd Friday, when the former Raptor returned to Scotiabank Arena for the first time since he was traded to the Spurs in a deal for Kawhi Leonard.
Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan is past the shock and anger of being traded by Toronto, but his first game back finds him searching within.
DeMar DeRozan left Las Vegas Summer League feeling like he was part of Toronto's long-term future. Two days later, he was a Spur. Here's what the former Raptor had to say.
When those 48 minutes ended, though, the love immediately returned. The fans gave DeRozan yet another standing ovation as he exited the floor. He walked off amid a procession of Raptors who had come to greet him -- which he reciprocated with a surprise appearance in Toronto's postgame locker room. He gave Pascal Siakam grief about falling for his pump fake and playfully pretended to be dragged out of the room by Serge Ibaka.
They were just further examples of how deep the bonds run here for DeRozan, the skinny kid from Compton who became a star in a city where he helped make basketball relevant. He never wanted to leave Toronto, and Toronto never wanted him to leave.
Sports, though, rarely have fairy-tale endings. Instead, they're usually messy ones -- just as DeRozan's exit from Toronto was last summer.
But time heals all wounds. And one day, DeRozan will get his rightful place in the rafters -- possibly as the first player in franchise history to have his number placed there.
On this night, though, cheers would have to suffice. And so they came, wave after wave of them, a nearly two-minute thank-you for everything he had done for the Raptors, for Toronto, for basketball in this country.
And for just a moment, DeMar DeRozan was home again.

Big men Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard tweeted videos of about eight members of the team, including All-Star point guard Damian Lillard, passing the time while they waited for the elevator to get fixed, complaining about the heat and counting off the minutes.
Later, the teammates crawled out of the elevator to cheers from bystanders.
""Stairs!"" the players said as they exited.
Emerson College said in a statement that the elevator at the practice facility stopped between two floors, delaying members of the Trail Blazers from reaching the street level.

26134208,"The Los Angeles Lakers and free agent Carmelo Anthony are pausing talks on a possible contract agreement unless the franchise makes a turn back toward pursuit of Western Conference playoffs contention, league sources told ESPN.
The Lakers had been leaning toward signing Anthony for the rest of the season -- until losses in four of the past five games left the organization and Anthony's camp wondering if it made sense to bring the veteran into an unsettled environment with suddenly so little chance of making the playoffs, league sources said.
The Lakers have fallen to their worst postseason odds yet this season, listed at +600 to reach the playoffs following Saturday's loss to the Suns.
Anthony, a 10-time All-Star, had been hoping to find a new team that would provide a positive conclusion to his season after an abrupt stay with the Houston Rockets.
The Lakers had waited on Anthony through the March 1 deadline for players to be waived and be eligible for playoff rosters to see who else would become available and perhaps be willing to sign with them, league sources said.
The Lakers' 118-109 loss to the Phoenix Suns on Saturday left the franchise with a 30-33 record and bleak prospects to catch the Los Angeles Clippers for the eighth seed in the West. ESPN's Basketball Power Index forecasts the Lakers with a less than 1 percent chance to make the playoffs.
The Lakers also have considered signing a center to bolster their frontcourt, league sources said. The Lakers are one roster spot below the league's maximum of 15.
Anthony, 34, parted ways with the Rockets after 10 regular-season games. He was traded to the Chicago Bulls as part of a financial deal on Jan. 22, and eventually was waived to become a free agent on Feb. 1.
Anthony has averaged 24 points a game in his 15 NBA seasons.

26124916,"In fact, Iguodala believes that Curry is the second-best point guard of all time at this point in his career.
""I still think he doesn't really get the respect he deserves,"" Iguodala said after watching Curry drop 28 points in a 120-117 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. ""Guys think he uses a lot of screens and guys think they can draw mismatches with him defensively, but he's a real problem. I think I told [Kevin Durant], he said he missed me on the shot he took, and I said, 'Y'all two are like Michael Jordan, there's no such thing as a bad shot.' That's for real, and people don't understand the presence they bring to the court. Especially on the offensive end.""
Stephen Curry shook off foul trouble to score 28 points and spark the Golden State Warriors down the stretch of a 120-117 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night.
The return of DeMarcus Cousins gave Golden State a lineup whose members could all end up in the Hall of Fame. But the results so far have been mixed.
Iguodala, who later said that Magic Johnson is the best point guard of all time, does not think that Curry ever will get the respect he deserves.
""It is what it is sometimes,"" Iguodala said. ""But when you sit down and have serious conversations, that's when you -- he's the second-best point guard ever -- you argue that.""
Curry took Iguodala's comments in stride after helping the Warriors finish off a win at the end of a long four-game road trip.
""Every day he texts me when I wake up in the morning and tells me that same comment,"" Curry said. ""I got some work to do to get to No. 1 apparently.""
Iguodala's comments also gave Curry a chance to promote the tour he has set up for prospects who fly under the radar.
""Underrated-dot-com,"" Curry said after being told of Iguodala's ""underrated"" remark. ""Check out the tour. They're in Philly today and tomorrow. I'm trying to share that with the world for sure. Underratedtour-dot-com, sorry.""
Curry said he is not thinking about his own legacy at the moment, but his teammates already know the powerful force he has had on the game all over the world.
""Most important is [his] impact on the game of basketball,"" Warriors forward Draymond Green said. ""Have you been to a high school game or a middle school game -- Mark Jackson said a few years ago, 'Steph is ruining the game of basketball.' We all was pissed off like, 'What, what is he talking about?' I went to some high school games, and I said I see what he's talking about. He's not talking about Steph per se that's ruining basketball, but he's making a lot of other people think they can do what he does. And it ain't the case. And so organization good, game good, team good, but the game of basketball is really where he makes his hay.""
As for the ""underrated"" comment, Green was in agreement with Iguodala.
""I think so,"" Green said. ""Magic was great obviously, but it's also two completely different types of point guards. I don't think Steph is close to being the type of point guard as Magic -- at the type of point guard Magic was. And vice versa. Magic's not close to being as close to the type of point guard as Steph is. But in his own right [Steph] probably is the best ever, and especially in the way the game is played today. He's continuing to climb; that's amazing. Like Andre said, you still don't see him get the due that he deserves, but it is what it is.""

26027225,"After a three-day hiatus, the NBA will return Thursday for a frenetic sprint to the finish of the league's regular season. Over the next seven weeks, there will be a variety of storylines to follow that will tell the story of not only how this season will play out but also what will happen this postseason and beyond.
Here is a list of the six biggest stories to follow when the ball goes up again:
After the Golden State Warriors, arguably the four best teams all reside in the Eastern Conference: the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers.
That should make the final two rounds of the East playoffs as compelling as they've been in decades, assuming, of course, that the Indiana Pacers can't hang on to the third seed and force two of these teams to face off in the first round. The next several weeks will also be a fight among all four of those teams to secure home-court advantage in the playoffs.
Milwaukee holds the inside track for the top spot -- and with it, home-court advantage throughout the East playoffs -- as it leads Toronto by two games in the loss column. Because the Bucks won the season series and thus the head-to-head tiebreaker, it is functionally a three-loss lead. Given that the Bucks and Raptors have the fourth- and second-easiest remaining schedules, it's hard to see the Celtics or Sixers (tied for fourth place, 5.5 games behind Toronto) catching either of them.
The final stretch will begin with the Bucks hosting the Celtics on Thursday in what could be the preview of a second-round playoff series. Including that meeting, there are five games remaining to be played between some combination of these teams. The others: Celtics at Raptors on Feb. 26, Celtics at Sixers on March 20, and two between the Bucks and Sixers -- in Milwaukee on March 17 and in Philadelphia on April 4.
All of them will be on national television, and each will be scrutinized for clues to tell us about what lies ahead in what will assuredly be a vicious fight to escape the East this spring.
When LeBron James chose to migrate to the Western Conference last summer by signing with the Los Angeles Lakers, it was universally understood that he would see his NBA Finals streak end at eight straight trips. Few people, though, considered the possibility that another streak -- 13 straight playoff appearances -- would come to an end, too.
Everyone is considering it now.
With 25 games remaining, the Lakers are 28-29, sit in 10th place in the Western Conference standings and are three games behind their Staples Center co-tenants, the Los Angeles Clippers, for the West's eighth and final playoff spot.
To say the Lakers have their work cut out for them is an understatement. They have the fourth-toughest remaining schedule in the NBA, according to ESPN Stats & Information projections (the Clippers' schedule, by comparison, ranks 19th), with 16 of those final 25 games coming against playoff teams.
If the Lakers want to make the playoffs, they will almost certainly have to make up those three games on the Clippers -- and then some -- before the calendar flips to April. Once it does, the Lakers have a brutal final five games: at Oklahoma City, home against Golden State and the Clippers (on the second half of a back-to-back) and home against Utah and Portland.
If the Lakers have to make up ground by then, their chances of doing so would seem remote.
It will be all but essential for the Lakers to sweep their eight remaining games against teams currently in the bottom eight in the NBA (including three against the potentially Anthony Davis-less Pelicans). Considering that the Lakers have already lost three games to the lowly Knicks, Cavaliers and Hawks -- and if they had won, they'd be tied for eighth in the West today -- they can't afford to lose any more.
Whether the Lakers can squeak into the playoffs won't be the only thing worth watching out West. So, too, will be the maneuvering to avoid Golden State for as long as possible.
Because the NBA doesn't re-seed its playoffs, being second, third, sixth or seventh -- on the opposite side of the bracket from the likely top-seeded Warriors -- is vastly more appealing than being on the same side as Golden State.
Executive produced by Kevin Durant, The Boardroom explores the most fascinating trends and innovative endeavors across the business of sports, featuring conversations with athletes, executives and business titans. Watch on ESPN+
Oklahoma City, which currently sits in third place in the West, has a three-game lead over the Portland Trail Blazers and leads the Houston Rockets by four but faces the toughest remaining schedule of any NBA team, according to ESPN Stats & Information. Meanwhile, the Jazz and Spurs are tied for sixth -- and sit one game behind the fifth-place Rockets and one ahead of the eighth-place Clippers.
All of this will make for appointment viewing on a nightly basis out West in the final 25 games of the season, as a six-game spread from the Trail Blazers in fourth to the Lakers in 10th means the standings will fluctuate virtually every day.
With an opportunity to be on a side of the bracket led by the team going for a three-peat or one led by a team (Denver) that hasn't made the playoffs in five years, those fluctuations will have massive implications.
Last season, James Harden was seen as a virtual lock to win the league's MVP award by season's end after he led Houston to the NBA's best record. This season, though, there should be a robust debate over who will be crowned this time around.
Harden will once again be in the conversation. He's currently in the midst of a scoring streak -- 31 straight games with 30 or more points -- that only Wilt Chamberlain has matched (which, given how absurd Chamberlain's career numbers are, is about as good as no one having done it before). The fact that Harden has resurrected the Rockets after an awful start with Chris Paul spending much of that stretch injured will also help his case.
Then there's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who has been the face of a remarkable burst onto the scene by the Bucks. Milwaukee currently has the NBA's best record. Antetokounmpo is putting up absurd numbers (27.2 points, 12.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.4 blocks) and doesn't have another big-name star playing alongside him, though Khris Middleton did make his first All-Star Game this season. Houston travels to Milwaukee on March 26 for a nationally televised game that could play a role in determining the winner if either guy has a huge game on such a big stage.
Over the past few weeks, Paul George has forced himself into the conversation with an incredible stretch of play. George might be the favorite to win the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award, and the Thunder are a staggering 22 points per 100 possessions better when he's on the court than when he sits -- easily the best mark in the league.
This debate is destined to be the kind that is both endlessly entertaining and frustrating. All three players have compelling cases and, depending on one's perspective, can be reasonably argued to finish in any order.
That debate will rage for the next seven weeks -- and likely the two months afterward until the NBA's awards show in late June.
Ever since agent Rich Paul made Davis' trade request public on Jan. 28, the Pelicans have been in a frenzy.
They spent the following 10 days dealing with constant reporting about their franchise cornerstone potentially being dealt, only for him to not go anywhere. Then, after not trading him, the Pelicans agreed to allow Davis to return to the team, leading to an awkward dance that has seen his minutes vary and fluctuate and has created more awkwardness in New Orleans.
That culminated Thursday, when Davis left the arena before New Orleans had finished its win over Oklahoma City to get an MRI on his shoulder. The next day, the Pelicans parted ways with general manager Dell Demps, and Danny Ferry was named his interim replacement. Then Davis gave an extraordinary media conference at All-Star Weekend on Saturday in which he declared that his intention is to continue playing the remainder of the season (in addition to everything he said about potential future destinations).
Will Davis play for the Pelicans again this season? If so, how much will he play and for how much longer? Some around the league think he has played his last game now that the All-Star Game is in the rearview mirror. But whether he has or not, the only certainty in New Orleans moving forward is that this situation will stop being weird only when Davis is sent packing -- presumably sometime this summer.
While there will be plenty of focus on the various playoff races in both conferences, there will be just as much jockeying for position at the other end of the standings. The combination of the NBA's new odds for its draft lottery and various pick protections will make for plenty of other things for people to pay attention to.
We'll start at the bottom of the lottery, where the Suns, Knicks, Cavaliers and Bulls are all jockeying to take advantage of the NBA's new lottery odds. The rule changes put in place for this season have the worst three teams in the league sharing even 14 percent chances of securing the No. 1 overall pick, the first of now four picks that are selected by the lottery process. The Knicks and Suns currently are tied with 11 wins, the Cavaliers have 12, and the Bulls have 14. There are several more meetings among them all, too, including the Cavaliers hosting the Suns on Thursday. Phoenix hosting New York on March 6 could also be a pivotal game.
Meanwhile, there are two teams in the middle of the lottery -- the Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks -- that will be spending the next few weeks positioning themselves to either keep or give up their picks this season, depending where they wind up. Memphis will send its pick to Boston if it is outside the top eight, as part of a trade for Jeff Green five years ago, and Dallas will give its pick to Atlanta if it is outside the top five, as part of the Trae Young-Luka Doncic swap during last year's draft.
The Beard's historic production and the Greek Freak's brute-force domination represent opposite sides of the league's MVP conversation.
Are LeBron and the Lakers in trouble? Can the Warriors hang on to No. 1 in the West? We're setting you up for the season's final two months.
Here's our new projection for both rounds, plus the latest on 10 intriguing prospects.
The Grizzlies sit in sixth place in the lottery standings with 23 wins, are 5-20 in their past 25 games and sold off pieces at the trade deadline -- most notably franchise icon Marc Gasol. But Memphis is only one win behind the Washington Wizards in seventh and three behind the Mavericks and Pelicans, who are tied for eighth. If Memphis could surpass them all, the Grizzlies would be able to send their pick this year -- so long as they don't jump up in the lottery themselves.
Given that Memphis is starting a rebuild, it would be in the Grizzlies' interest to attempt to move a weaker pick this year, given that it becomes top-six protected next season and unprotected in 2021.
Dallas, on the other hand, would love to keep its first-round pick. Leaping into the top five and getting one more young talent to pair with Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis would be huge for the Mavericks, who traded away two more future first-rounders (and 2017 first-round pick Dennis Smith Jr.) to the Knicks earlier this month in the Porzingis deal.
Every team the Mavericks can let past them over the next few weeks will increase their odds of doing so and, rather than giving the Hawks a mid-lottery pick this season, could mean sending them one outside of it in 2020 if Dallas can make the playoffs behind Doncic and Porzingis.
Then there are the Clippers, who will send their pick to the Celtics if they make the playoffs. Although the Clippers weakened themselves by trading away Tobias Harris at the deadline, they went on to add two solid contributors in Garrett Temple and JaMychal Green and should be in the mix right down to the season's end.

26092152,"The race for consensus No. 1 overall NBA draft prospect Zion Williamson is on. But this tankathon will be different from that of past seasons.
This is the first year under the lottery reform rules passed in September 2017 -- more of an incremental step to deter blatant tanking than a complete overhaul. Every loss at the bottom of the standings is now less valuable.
Here's how the new system works, which teams are in the best position entering March, the traded picks to watch and more draft intrigue.
More: Mock draft | Top 100 prospects | Traded picks 
The NBA now draws the top four picks through the lottery instead of the top three, with the teams' chances of a winning selection flattened.
Here are the new odds for the 14 lottery slots compared to the old ones:
Some key insights to know:
The difference between finishing with the worst record and the third-worst record has shrunk. The bottom three teams have the same odds at both the No. 1 pick (14 percent) and staying in the top four (12 percent). The main difference: You're more likely to fall out of the top five with a better record.
The gap starts with the fourth-worst team, though the difference isn't huge. The fourth-worst team can fall as far as No. 8, but on average that pick falls around No. 4 or No. 5.
The worst team has a 47.9 percent chance to fall to No. 5. The lowest a team could fall under the old system was No. 4, and there was just a 35.7 percent chance of that happening.
Look at the middle of the lottery: Teams with the sixth- through ninth-worst records have (in some cases) doubled their chances of landing in the top five. Though the expected picks for teams in the bottom half of the lottery moved up less than one pick -- according to data from the NBA in a report by ESPN's Zach Lowe -- there's inevitably going to be more random movement over time.
Projecting the strength of any draft is challenging, but this is an interesting year to start having identical odds for the No. 1 pick and a top-four selection among the worst teams. Despite a lingering injury, Williamson is a runaway No. 1 pick, and the second tier of prospects behind him goes about three deep, including RJ Barrett, Ja Morant and Cam Reddish. ESPN draft analyst Jonathan Givony said on last week's Woj Pod that teams have more questions about the prospects in the Nos. 5-10 range.
Here are the latest odds for each likely lottery team, according to ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI).
The Phoenix Suns (17.5 projected wins), New York Knicks (18.6) and Cleveland Cavaliers (19.3) have a decent lead on earning those coveted top-three spots and an equal chance at Williamson, per BPI. (FiveThirtyEight projects a similar finish.)
The Chicago Bulls (23.1) and Atlanta Hawks (26.2) aren't out of this race, but they have some ground to make up. And remember: We're talking about much smaller differences in lottery odds between slots. If the Bulls finish fourth, they have a 12.5 percent chance at No. 1 and a 48.1 percent chance at a top-four pick. If they move up to third, those odds bump up by only 1.5 and 4.0 percentage points, respectively
Here are the protected and traded picks to know about in the lottery, along with BPI's projections on where they land:
Mavericks-Hawks
The Mavericks owe their pick to the Hawks if it falls outside the top five. If not conveyed, the pick remains top-five protected in 2020, falls to top-three protected until 2022 and becomes unprotected in 2023.
Chances Dallas keeps its pick: 14.9 percent
Chances Atlanta gets a top-10 pick from Dallas this year: 37.6 percent
Which young stars are taking over the NBA?
As the Lakers and Celtics continue to struggle, another team has faced adversity and persevered.
Grizzlies-Celtics
The Grizzlies owe their pick to the Celtics if it falls outside the top eight. If not conveyed, the pick falls to top-six protected in 2020 and then becomes unprotected in 2021.
Chances Memphis keeps its pick: 91.4 percent
Chances Boston gets a top-10 pick from Memphis this year: 8.0 percent
Clippers-Celtics
The Clippers owe their pick to the Celtics if it falls outside the lottery. If not conveyed, the pick remains lottery protected in 2020 and then converts to a 2022 second-round pick.
Chances LA keeps its pick this year: 10.4 percent
Kings-Celtics-76ers
The Kings owe their pick to the Celtics unprotected, but the 76ers will get the selection if this becomes the No. 1 pick. In that scenario, Boston would get Philadelphia's pick.
Chances Sacramento is in the lottery: 88.4 percent
Chances Boston gets a top-10 pick from Sacramento: 7.6 percent
Chances Philadelphia gets the No. 1 pick from Sacramento: 1.0 percent
Cavaliers-Hawks
The Cavaliers owe their pick to the Hawks if it falls outside the top 10. If not conveyed, the pick remains top-10 protected in 2020 and then converts to second-round picks in 2021 and 2022.
Chances Cleveland keeps its pick: Greater than 99 percent
The new odds lower the stakes to lose every game in the tank race, but top-five picks remain some of the best assets in this league. Plus, there are protected selections at stake. There's bound to still be some gamesmanship along the way.
Here's a breakdown of the remaining schedule for the bottom eight teams, using BPI.
Keep in mind that top teams resting their best players at the end of the regular season isn't guaranteed. Home-court advantage throughout the playoffs remains a toss-up and could go down to the wire.

26277431,"LOS ANGELES -- Doc Rivers said he can't remember the last time in his two decades as an NBA head coach he and the opposing head coach were ejected at the same point in the same game.
But it happened in the third quarter Friday. So Rivers joked afterward that he spent the fourth quarter enjoying a bottle of top-shelf California red wine while his LA Clippers polished off the Chicago Bulls 128-121 at Staples Center.
""I don't think I've ever seen that, but I've been around a long while, so I needed to try something new,"" Rivers joked. ""It felt pretty good, actually. The Opus [One wine] was phenomenal while I was watching the fourth quarter.""
Rivers and Bulls coach Jim Boylen were each ejected with 1 minute, 14 seconds left in the third quarter after engaging in a heated exchange on the sideline. What sparked their exchange was a screen set near midcourt by Clippers forward Montrezl Harrell, who was whistled for an offensive foul.
Danilo Gallinari scored 27 points, Montrezl Harrell added 26 and the Los Angeles Clippers rallied in a third quarter that saw both coaches ejected for arguing to beat the Chicago Bulls 128-121 on Friday night.
Referee Jason Phillips said the second technical fouls for each coach, which prompted automatic ejections, were for a continuation of their argument.
""We told [the coaches] that was enough, and then they continued,"" Phillips said.
Boylen intimated that the screen Harrell set was of the same variety that injured one of his players in the first half.
""I spoke with the officials before the half,"" Boylen said. ""I said you have to look at that moving screen [in the first half]. I think it was an offensive foul. They came back at half and told me it was an offensive foul and they missed it, which I appreciate. Which is good officiating. And I let it go.
Clippers' head coach Doc Rivers says he doesn't know why he was ejected and all he said to Jim Boylen was tell your guys to call out the screens.
""Then [the Clippers] set another moving screen at half court that they call an offensive foul, and I've already got a guy sitting in the locker room with a bang that he took in the first half.""
Boylen was referencing point guard Ryan Arcidiacono, who left the game after taking a hard hit in the first half.
""Now they go after my other point guard with a moving screen and I don't appreciate it,"" Boylen continued. ""I let them know I don't appreciate that. I let everybody know. I don't know how Doc got involved. He didn't think it was a moving foul. I've got no issue with Doc. I've got no problems with Doc. He's fighting for his team. I'm fighting for my team. I'm worried about my group and protecting my group.""
After Harrell set his second-half screen, Rivers said he started talking to an official.
""I just said, basically, that was a clean pick, and all of the sudden I hear Boylen yelling at me, saying that we were dirty or whatever, because I guess in the first half, he set another legal pick and one of their guys got hurt,"" Rivers said. ""I wanted to say maybe turn around and look at your guys and tell them to call out picks, but don't yell at me. I didn't say it that nicely.""
Rivers continued, ""And then the ref just came and threw us both out. I don't ever talk to the other coach, unless the coach talks to me. I don't think I should've been thrown out for that. I didn't instigate anything.
""I don't think one coach should ever make comments to another coach about his team, but Jimmy chose to do that. That's up to him. That's up to him.""
Harrell, for his part, said Boylen didn't make any comments directed at him.
""Honestly, I didn't really think it was an illegal screen, just like the first one I set,"" Harrell said. ""It's not up to me to call out the person that I'm screening and let them know I'm screening them. I stood there in the middle of the floor and waited until my guy drove the ball up the floor both times. They got hit with screens, that's on their bigs to call out screens.
""I didn't do anything maliciously. I didn't do anything dirty. Those are straight basketball plays. So if you want to get mad at me about that, get mad at your own big. ... He's got to let you know it's a blind screen. As far as that taking place, that's just two passionate coaches getting fired up about a current play. One coach felt like it was a dirty play, the other was doing the right thing defending me as a player and also what he felt like was a right play on the court.""

26125031,"PHILADELPHIA -- What was a wildly entertaining game between the Warriors and 76ers -- one ultimately won by Golden State 120-117 -- instead will be remembered for two head-scratching decisions by Philadelphia inside the final minute.
Both of them -- an intentional foul by 76ers forward Mike Scott and an intentionally missed free throw by 76ers guard Ben Simmons -- kept Philadelphia from ever getting off a potential tying shot.
""There's so much situation stuff that we just really haven't had the chance to go through with our new guys,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""Whether you need a 3 on a sideline, whether you're trying to miss a free throw and position people around, whether you want a foul or don't-you-foul type stuff, even though these guys are great players, have been around the league a long time, every coaching staff is sort of different.
Sixers center Joel Embiid says he has learned his lesson trying to play through discomfort, which is why he has missed the past five games with left knee soreness. But the All-Star said he expects to return next week.
""Some of it isn't their fault, and it's nobody's fault. It's just the fact that we've [only] been with each other for a minute, and at times like that, it rears its head and you feel that pain.""
Scott's intentional foul was an unambiguous mistake. After Tobias Harris made a 3-pointer with 37.1 seconds left -- one of the few shots he got to go down on a night he went 7-for-20 overall and 3-for-11 from 3-point range -- to get to within 117-114, Philadelphia had a chance to play defense, stop the Warriors and get the ball back for a potential tying shot.
Only Philadelphia didn't play defense. Instead, Scott inexplicably wrapped up Warriors star Kevin Durant with 35 seconds left, sending him to the free throw line, where the 89 percent free throw shooter calmly drained both to put Golden State back up by five.
""Shouldn't have,"" Brown said bluntly when asked about Scott's foul. ""Shouldn't have.""
When Scott talked to reporters about a half hour later, he made no attempt to argue.
""I'm going to get mad all over again,"" he said. ""Just bad. I am not one for excuses ... there's no excuse. I just have to do better.""
Asked what he was thinking on the play, Scott simply said, ""It just wasn't good. That's on me. I've just got to be better. I don't have nothing for you. I just have to be better.""
The second decision -- Simmons intentionally missing a free throw with 10.3 seconds left -- was much more controversial and debatable. After Golden State had thrown away the ball while leading by three with 19.3 seconds left, Philadelphia had a chance to get off a potential tying shot.
Before the 76ers could, Draymond Green fouled Simmons near midcourt -- a foul Green didn't want to commit and was upset was called on him.
Still, there were worse outcomes for the Warriors than sending Simmons -- a 58 percent free throw shooter -- to the line in that situation. When Simmons made the first, the assumption was he would try to make the second. Philadelphia would then go for a steal on the inbounds pass and foul if it failed to get the ball, sending the Warriors back to the line and still leaving the Sixers with a chance to, at worst, tie the score with a 3.
Instead, Simmons tried to intentionally miss and wound up missing the rim entirely, giving the ball back to Golden State.
After the game, any question about whether that was something Simmons did on his own disappeared when Brown was asked if that was his decision.
""Absolutely,"" the coach said. ""Obviously you have to hit the rim, but yes.""
Brown's rationale was that, with no timeouts left, he would rather go for an offensive rebound on a missed free throw than go up and down the court with Golden State in a free throw shooting contest.
""Not for us,"" Brown said. ""When I don't have timeouts, and we have to do something coming back, I will do it all day, every day -- miss it and try to get some kind of a putback.
""I think it's questionable for me when I have timeouts. When I don't, that's what we're going to do.""
Most people watching felt it was questionable to miss the free throw intentionally in that situation -- Green included.
""I didn't understand that one,"" Green said. ""I mean, you can't say he didn't catch us off guard because we didn't still get the clean rebound. It may have worked had he hit the rim, but nonetheless I was shocked.""
Remarkably, Philadelphia wound up down three with the ball one final time when Durant missed the second of two free throws with 4.5 seconds left. But when Simmons hit Harris in the corner with a pass that initially appeared to give him a chance at a potential tying shot, Harris wound up being crowded by two defenders and stepping out of bounds before heaving up a shot that had little chance of going in anyway.
""At that time, we didn't have any timeouts or anything, so we were just trying to get to the 3-point line,"" Harris said. ""Obviously, when he threw it, two guys came running out, I was already kind of leaning out of bounds.
""It was just a tough play, honestly, with no timeouts and having the ball at three-quarter court to throw it in.""

26225666,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State Warriors All-Star swingman Klay Thompson called Sunday night's 115-111 defeat to the Phoenix Suns the ""worst of the season"" and then asked for more energy from the Oracle Arena fans down the stretch.
""It wasn't pretty,"" Thompson said after the Warriors combined to shoot 10-for-43 from beyond the 3-point arc. ""Probably [our] worst loss of the season, unfortunately.""
On top of the poor shooting performance, Thompson was disappointed in what he felt was a lack of enthusiasm from an Oracle Arena crowd that watched the Warriors give up a 16-point first-half lead and then go through the motions for much of the night. Like the rest of his teammates, he isn't sure exactly why the focus hasn't been there on a regular basis this season, but it's clear that the lack of consistency is frustrating the group. The Warriors are now 24-10 at home this season in the final year at Oracle.
""It's a long season,"" Thompson said. ""And we've been playing a lot of basketball for five years now, so you're not going to be perfect for 82 games -- we've had too many missteps -- but at the end of the day, that's the first time we've lost to that team in 19 games. So it's ugly but ... I expect our crowd to be little more into it, too. Like, I know it's not the playoffs, but it is our last go-around at Oracle. Least you can stand up or something when we make a good play, especially in the beginning. We need that energy, especially this time of the year. It's hard to conjure up energy every single night 'cause you're looking forward to the playoffs and that run.
Warriors star Kevin Durant suffered a right ankle contusion midway through the fourth quarter of the Warriors' 115-111 loss to the Suns on Sunday.
Devin Booker scored 13 straight Phoenix points during a key fourth-quarter stretch and finished with 37, and the Suns snapped the NBA's longest active losing streak to one opponent at 18 games by beating the Golden State Warriors 115-111 on Sunday.
""So we expect our fans to kind of bring that from the jump. ... It's like us, though. You can't bring it every night, but still it helps. ... It doesn't matter if we're playing the Suns or the Bucks, whoever it is. We need that energy from them because we feed off that.""
Warriors coach Steve Kerr was just as frustrated about his team's performance. He came into the game hoping his group would play with more focus coming off an impressive win Friday night over the Denver Nuggets, but that wasn't the case. The loss marked the first time in 19 games that the Suns defeated the Warriors. The last Suns victory over the Warriors came on Nov. 9, 2014. The 18-game streak was the Warriors' longest streak against one opponent in team history.
""It was the right outcome,"" Kerr said. ""They beat the crap out of us. ... We laid an egg.""
The loss culminates a variety of emotions for the proud Warriors group. On Tuesday, Golden State was blown out by the Boston Celtics by 33 points at Oracle, marking the worst home loss in the Kerr era. Kerr and his players all talked about following that performance up with a better effort and seemed pleased with the tenacity the group showed in Friday's win over the Nuggets. Now, after an unexpected loss to the Suns, the Warriors begin a difficult four-game road trip Wednesday against the Houston Rockets.
""I guess we got to look back in the mirror again,"" Kerr said. ""Take another look.""
This was the Suns' first road win all season against a Western Conference team. They were 0-19 coming into this game. The previous 19 losses were by an average of 17.9 points per game. It was also one of the biggest upsets. The Suns closed as a 17-point underdog against the Warriors, marking the largest upset in an NBA game since March 6, 2016, when the Lakers upset the Warriors as a 17.5-point underdog. That's the only time in the past 20 seasons that an underdog of at least 17 points has won.
The Warriors haven't won consecutive games since winning five straight Feb. 2-12. It's the second time in the Kerr era that the Warriors have gone at least 10 games without winning consecutive games.
Despite the loss, there remains little concern within the Warriors' locker room that the tough times will last.
""Let's not forget last year,"" Stephen Curry said with a smile, referring to the end of the 2018 regular season in which the Warriors dealt with both injuries and losses down the stretch. ""It was way worse than this. Way worse than this. We've talked about the things we need to get better at and just haven't done it.
""It's an uncomfortable feeling, which I think we like right now because it's not all coasting -- it's we're getting challenged. We're getting teams' best shots,"" Curry added. ""Our weaknesses are pretty glaring in terms of defensively and how we've started games. So we can talk about it and I keep saying it, but we understand what we need to do to get better. But I like this situation a lot better than last year.""

26262269,"Over the two seasons in which NBA teams have been allowed to sell space on jerseys to advertisers, there has been one holdout: The Oklahoma City Thunder kept their jerseys patch-free.
That will end Saturday, as the Thunder have reached a four-year agreement with Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores, an Oklahoma City-based national retail chain, the team tells ESPN.com. The company, founded in Oklahoma in 1964, will have its patch debut on Thunder jerseys during Saturday night's nationally televised game against the Golden State Warriors.
Love's was one of the Thunder's original sponsors when the team moved to Oklahoma City in 2008 and has maintained deals with the team in all 11 of its seasons there. It sponsors the popular in-arena Kiss Cam and serves as the namesake for the third level in the Chesapeake Energy Arena -- Love's Loud City.
The Love's logo on Thunder jerseys has never appeared anywhere else; the company -- in conjunction with the Thunder -- designed a custom logo for the jersey patches, said Brian Byrnes, the Thunder's senior vice president of sales and marketing. ""One of the things that being last really helped us to do was to coach Love's on how to optimize this,"" Byrnes said.
The Thunder and the NBA would not disclose the exact financial terms of the deal. The team said the deal ranks among the top 10 in average annual value, which would put it somewhere a little south of $10 million based on publicly known amounts. The league's 29 pre-existing patches brought in more than $150 million per season so far, according to league sources.Editor's PicksLowe: LeBron vs. MJ, this Lakers season and a great NBA what-ifLeBron is headed to the lottery in his first season out West.

LeBron is headed to the lottery in his first season out West. That means something ... but what?
Zach talks to ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz about his Suns feature (3:20), and LeBron and the Lakers likely missing the playoffs (48:43).
The Warriors have by far the richest; the Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten paid the team an estimated $20 million per season on a three-year patch deal, according to ESPN.com's prior reporting. Some of the original patch deals will expire in the next year or two, and league observers are curious about whether the market for them has improved.
The Thunder were under no time pressure to make a deal, team officials say. They met with several candidates and were willing to wait for the right partner. ""We are not a knee-jerk organization,"" Byrnes said. ""I don't think we saw this as something we needed to do. That was clearly the directive from our owner -- that we did not need to do this.""
In end, they liked the idea of a company with local ties, an entrenched relationship with the team, and an upward national trajectory. (Love's, which specializes in ""highway hospitality,"" now has almost 500 locations in 41 states, according to company data.)
""We wanted a comprehensive partnership -- someone who saw this as not just a marketing platform,"" Byrnes said. ""That they have been with us for all 11 years here was one of the things that really crystallized this for us.""

26244804,"LOS ANGELES -- CJ McCollum missed his first seven shots Tuesday night.
But when the fourth quarter arrived, the Portland Trail Blazers guard turned an off night into one of the hottest of his career.
McCollum scored 23 points in the final frame of a 125-104 win over the LA Clippers, his most points ever in the fourth quarter, as he topped his previous high of 16.
Most impressive of all: McCollum outscored the Clippers 23-20 in the fourth.
""I don't ever get gun-shy,"" said McCollum, who finished with a game-high 35 points on 12-of-21 shooting from the floor. ""I've missed a lot of shots in my career. You've just got to stay confident.""
After his slow start, McCollum finished the night by making 12 of his final 14 shots from the floor and keyed the decisive fourth quarter, in which the Trail Blazers outscored the Clippers 40-20.
""He showed what he's made of,"" Portland coach Terry Stotts said. ""He came in here, never lost confidence, took the shots that were there and got us over the hump.""
Said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, ""We made a lot of defensive mistakes, but CJ McCollum was on fire. A lot of that was just shot-making because some were just one-on-ones. You live with it.""
Portland guard Damian Lillard wasn't surprised by his backcourt mate's big night.
""I've seen that movie,"" said Lillard, who scored 20 points to go with 12 assists. ""I always tell you guys: When he sees the ball go in a few times, he can get going. At that point, my job is to just make it last as long as possible.""
McCollum said he didn't know that he started 0-for-7 from the floor.
""I just knew I had missed some easy shots,"" he said. ""Just a couple minor adjustments, and once one goes in, it's all downhill from there usually.""

26234619,"SALT LAKE CITY -- Russell Westbrook expressed no regrets about a heated exchange with a fan during the Oklahoma City Thunder's win over the Utah Jazz on Monday night, saying that his threat, ""I'll f--- you up,"" to the man and his wife was an emotional response to ""completely disrespectful"" comments directed toward him.
The exchange, which occurred while Westbrook was on or near the end of the Thunder bench during the second quarter, was caught on video and went viral after being posted on Twitter.
According to Westbrook, the man told him to ""get down on your knees like you're used to."" Westbrook considered that comment to be ""racial"" and ""inappropriate.""
""For me, I'm just not going to continue to take disrespect for my family,"" said Westbrook, who had 23 points, 11 rebounds and 8 assists in the Thunder's 98-89 win. ""I just think there's got to be something done. There's got to be some consequences for those type of people that come to the game just to say and do whatever they want to say. I don't think it's fair to the players -- not just to me, but I don't think it's fair to the players.
""And if I had to do it again, I would say the same exact thing, because I truly will stand up for myself, for my family, for my kids, for my wife, for my mom, for my dad every single time. I expect anybody else to do the same. So that's kind of where I'm at with the whole situation. As for beating up his wife, I have never put my hand on a woman; I never will. Never been in any domestic violence before. Never have before, but once he said the comment, his wife repeated the same thing to me as well. So that's kind of how that started. I know you guys only got the tail end of the video, but the start of the video is way more important and way more disrespectful than what you guys heard.""
The fan, 45-year-old Shane Keisel, told ESPN that he did not cuss at Westbrook or say anything inappropriate. Keisel said the exchange ""started off as fun"" with him yelling at Westbrook to ""ice those knees up!"" According to Keisel, after Westbrook replied that it was heat on his knees, Keisel hollered, ""You're going to need it."" Keisel said his wife, Jennifer Huff, didn't participate in the exchange.
Shane Keisel, the Jazz fan Russell Westbrook was yelling at, explains how the situation escalated and that he isn't happy Westbrook went after his wife.
""He just went nuts,"" Keisel told ESPN. ""She never got up. She never stood up. She never said a word to him. I mean, it's all fine, we're having fun and games with the guy and we're talking, but at the end of the day, no man should threaten a woman, period.
""I'm not afraid of the guy. Come on up. But when you threaten a woman that's 5 feet tall and 110 pounds, you're a big man. So this guy needs to be exposed.""
Keisel, who was seated in the third row on the baseline near the Thunder bench, said the video was shot by a fan in the first row. Keisel said he sent the video to ""friends that are in the social media business"" because he wanted the exchange to be seen.
""I'm going to tell you one thing: I'll f--- him up if he says that s--- again. I promise you,"" Westbrook said to a security guard behind the bench at the beginning of the video posted to Twitter. Westbrook then looks toward Keisel. ""I promise you. You think I'm playing. I swear to God, I swear to God, I'll f--- you up. You and your wife, I'll f--- you up.
""I promise you, on everything I love. On everything I love, n----, I promise you.""
Keisel and a few other fans were issued warning cards for ""excessive verbal abuse"" that was in violation of the NBA fan code of conduct. The card stated that any further verbal abuse would subject them to being ejected without a refund.

""We are continuing to investigate the unfortunate exchange at tonight's game between Russell Westbrook and fans,"" a postgame statement released by the Jazz said. ""Multiple warning cards were issued by arena security. Players and fans have a shared responsibility to create a safe and respectful environment. If it is determined that any fans violated the NBA Code of Conduct, appropriate action will be taken.""
Thunder reserve guard Raymond Felton, who was on the bench, said he overheard the comments that prompted Westbrook's anger and confirmed his teammate's side of the story.
""I get it, sometimes some words are wrong, some things you say are wrong,"" Felton said. ""I'm not taking that away, I'm not saying that. All I'm saying is, when is it going to be about protecting us as players? That's just not right for Russ to have to deal with that when they said something to him first and they said something totally disrespectful. I heard it. I'm standing right there. I heard it. That's not right. That's all I'm saying. That's not right.""
Jazz forward Thabo Sefolosha also came to Westbrook's defense in a post on Instagram on Tuesday.
 Wanted to speak up on this! I ll probably delete later but I ll leave this here for now.
A post shared by  Thabo Sefolosha (@vevey1800) on Mar 12, 2019 at 10:02am PDT
The incident was reminiscent of the finale of last year's first-round playoff series between the Jazz and Thunder, when Utah ousted Oklahoma City in six games, after which Westbrook became involved with a fan as he exited the court.
""I didn't confront fans; fans confronted me,"" Westbrook said after the April game. ""Here in Utah, man, a lot of disrespectful, vulgar things are said to the players here with these fans. It's truly disrespectful. Talk about your families, your kids. It's truly disrespectful to the game, man.""
Dennis Schroder scored 24 points, Russell Westbrook added 23 points, 11 rebounds, and eight assists, and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Utah Jazz 98-89 on Monday night to sweep the season series.
Following two separate incidents with courtside fans in Utah on Friday, Russell Westbrook said after the Thunder's season-ending loss to the Jazz, that's ""something that needs to be brought up.""
That night, Westbrook slapped at a fan's cellphone as he walked to the tunnel following the Thunder's loss after scoring 46 points on 43 shots. It was the second interaction that night for Westbrook with a courtside fan, with him turning and snapping at one who said something to him as he exited the floor at halftime.
""I think there are a lot of great fans around the world that like to come to the game and enjoy the game,"" Westbrook said Monday night, when he issued a 2½-minute statement but did not take questions from the media. ""There are people that come to the game to say mean, disrespectful things about me, my family. For many years, I've done all the right things. I've never done anything to hurt or harm anybody. I've never been in any trouble, never fought a fan. Been in the league 11 years -- clean slate, humble.
""I'll take whatever, all the criticism from everybody. I've been doing the same thing for years. For me, disrespect will not be taken from me. I completely just sit back sometimes and just take it. That's just one video, but throughout the whole game, since I've been here, especially here in Utah, a lot of disrespectful things have been said.""
Felton urged the league office to make protecting the players a priority, calling the comments directed to Westbrook ""absurd.""
""They're always picking on Russ, and it's just not right, man,"" Felton said. ""It's not fair to tell a man to get on his knees: 'That's what you're used to doing.' Then turn around and his wife reiterates it and says it right back to him again. It's not right. Then everybody wants to make a big deal out of what [Westbrook] said, but let's talk about what they said to him first.
""He's not coming off and talking to the fans, just saying stuff to them, just blurting out words. He's not. They're coming at him first. When is there going to be a point where there's going to be protecting us players? People can say whatever they want to say to us during games and yell out stuff and talk about our families, talk about our kids. And that's just not fair. That's not right. So when is there going to be a point where it's going to be about protecting us players?""

26237579,"IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT that LeBron James didn't sign a four-year deal with the Los Angeles Lakers last summer and instead did what he did when he came back to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014 and signed a one-year deal with a player option.
Let's assume if that were the case, the already shaky situation with the Lakers might be more dramatic at the moment. However, it is not. In fact, it has been made clear to ownership that James remains fully committed to the Lakers, despite a very disappointing first season and an uncertain path toward improvement.
It must be said that James has often been a trendsetter among his superstar peers over the years. After seeing how rocky his first season in L.A. has gone, it has become tougher to project how it might affect the stars following James into free agency this summer.
Kevin Durant hasn't signed a long-term deal since 2010. Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard both demanded trades when they grew unhappy during their current long-term deals.
All three have also been willing to leave significant guaranteed money on the table in the past, which is part of the deal when opting to go short-term.
Durant has passed on max contracts each of the past two years and did so last summer to make sure he'd be a free agent again this year. Irving voided his chance at a supermax extension with the Cleveland Cavs when he asked out.
Leonard turned down a supermax extension with the San Antonio Spurs last summer, though it was offered after his trade request, when he'd already made up his mind. Once traded, both Irving and Leonard lost the ability to get supermaxes and the roughly $80 million extra it would've meant.
Having control is clearly important to all three. Teams act differently when star players are free-agents-to-be. Often, there's an undercurrent to all major moves with the star's happiness being protected.
How much that's worth to them might be a factor in how free agency in 2019 -- and, for that matter, 2020 -- plays out. It's also important to note that all three have dealt with serious injuries that have knocked them out for long periods, making short-term deals somewhat of a risk.
When James started this concept in 2014, it wasn't totally about a power play. With large forecasted jumps in the salary cap in 2015 and 2016, he didn't want to be locked into a deal and pass on maximizing his earnings.Editor's PicksLowe: LeBron vs. MJ, this Lakers season and a great NBA what-ifLeBron is headed to the lottery in his first season out West. That means something ... but what?Warriors riding rocky road on path to three-peatGolden State is in first place in the Western Conference and still the favorite to win a third consecutive NBA title. So why has this season been anything but golden for the Warriors?1 Related
LeBron is headed to the lottery in his first season out West. That means something ... but what?
Golden State is in first place in the Western Conference and still the favorite to win a third consecutive NBA title. So why has this season been anything but golden for the Warriors?
It worked. Had James taken a four-year deal in 2014, as he was able to, he'd have made roughly $18 million less than he did by refreshing his contract three times in the four-year run back in Cleveland.
It had the ancillary benefit, though, of keeping the Cavs on their toes. And there's no question that there was a value to that, as the team repeatedly pushed deeper and deeper into the luxury tax to surround James with as much talent as it could find.
The league is projecting about a 9 percent bump in the cap for 2020 -- nothing like the so-called 35 percent ""cap spike"" of 2016. A short-term deal this summer would likely be more about maintaining control and leaving options open than it would be about maximizing paychecks.
But there's something else to consider: Pending free-agency questions and speculation have been thorns in the sides of Durant and Irving all season, unnerving them. Both have staged their own version of a media boycott -- Durant didn't talk to the press for more than a week, and Irving went through a period in which he'd give only terse answers -- after getting irritated by questions and stories about their futures. Leonard has avoided some of the unpleasantness, though part of his strategy has been to avoid certain media requests.
Going with a short deal with a current or new team this summer would open the door for a repeat of that scenario throughout next season. But would it be more unpleasant than getting stuck in an unhappy situation?
This cuts both ways, and again, James is a model. By 2017, the Cavs had grown tired of James' lack of long-term commitment, and it contributed to the way they handled Irving's trade demand that summer. With James unwilling to extend beyond 2018, owner Dan Gilbert opted to protect his future when he preferred a deal centered around a draft pick. Star players protecting their options can strain relationships with teams.
These are legitimate questions the stars will be pondering in this modern and complicated NBA.
BRANDON INGRAM'S DIAGNOSIS of a blood clot in his arm was both scary and hurtful to the Lakers long-term. As someone who once had a blood clot, I am keenly aware of the dangers they present and the complexity of treating them. The Lakers' medical team's steps to find the issue were vital. Ingram's primary focus for the next few months will be on getting healthy, and the medication to do so will significantly disrupt his life.
Brian Windhorst, Kevin Pelton and Kirk Goldsberry discuss Brandon Ingram's injury and the Lakers' mounting issues. Listen now!
There is unfortunate fallout here. Ingram now must watch for blood clots the rest of his life. Although not all of the details of his diagnosis have been made public, typically blood clots that form without explanation suggest there is a greater chance they could return.
If Ingram gets another one, there is a chance his NBA career would be at risk because he'd have to be placed on blood thinning medication indefinitely. This is what happened to Chris Bosh and Mirza Teletovic, two players who were recently forced to retire because of recurring blood clots. Their blood clots were unexplained when they formed and later returned. In Bosh's case, it was a year later. For Teletovic, it happened three years later.
It was unlike the situation of former NBA player Anderson Varejao, who developed a blood clot after surgery in 2013 and went on to play without further issues. Blood clots after surgery are more common and explained.
Based on a sampling of NBA executives around the league the past few days, many believe Ingram's value has taken a real hit with this development. It feels dirty to discuss this as Ingram begins his treatment, but this is not happening in a vacuum.
The Lakers tried to center a trade for Anthony Davis around Ingram last month and might attempt to restart that process after the season, especially as Ingram was putting together one of the finest runs of play in his career. Even if doctors were able to determine that there is a low chance Ingram will develop blood clots in the future, several executives said teams might use this as a reason to lower his value.
Making this more difficult is the fact that Ingram is eligible for a contract extension this summer, whether it's with the Lakers or somewhere else. It is unlikely that a team could get insurance for blood clots for Ingram, which adds to the possible risk.
There is a history of elite athletes who had issues with blood clots, were treated and went on to long careers. Hakeem Olajuwon and Serena Williams are two examples. Let's all hope Ingram is part of this group. The percentages are on his side.
Even so, losing Ingram to this condition was a real blow for the Lakers, and it leaves the future uncertain.
THERE'S AN UNUSUAL DRAMA developing between the Dallas Mavericks and the Atlanta Hawks. According to the terms of the Luka Doncic trade on draft night last year, the Mavs will send the Hawks their 2019 pick if it falls outside the top five.
Get ready for Zion Williamson, Ja Morant and more.
• Latest NBA mock draft
• Top 100 draft rankings
• Draft assets for every team
• Rankings by stats and scouting
As little as a month ago, that looked like a relative certainty, as the Mavericks hovered around .500 and were on the fringe of the West playoff race. But as part of a roster makeover that led to the acquisition of Kristaps Porzingis and the trading of four starters, Dallas has plunged into a 1-11 tailspin. That has dropped it into position, at the moment, to have the No. 6 pick in this year's draft.
The Mavs have made it known that they'd prefer to send the pick to Atlanta this year -- in other words, they've denied that they're tanking. But whatever you want to call it, they aren't putting a great product on the floor.
With the change in the lottery odds this season and the new rule that calls for the top four picks to be determined by a drawing, the Mavs have found themselves with a 37 percent chance of leaping into the top four and keeping their pick. Had they stayed in 11th position, as they were before this slide, that number would've been 9 percent.
Both teams have huge stakes here. The Hawks' best hope would be for the Mavs to stick at the No. 6 pick and not get lottery luck. Atlanta currently has the fifth-worst record and 10.5 percent odds of getting the No. 1 pick and 42 percent odds of moving up. There's a good chance that they'd have two picks in the top six in what scouts believe is a top-heavy draft.
But if Dallas pulls off this little miracle, not only would the Mavericks have Doncic and Porzingis, but they'd also be able to add another top, young player to the mix. That would be a dream scenario. The lottery is May 14.

26088024,"ASK ANYONE WHO has come through the Phoenix Suns organization over the past decade, and they'll likely have a Robert Sarver story.
One longtime former player remembers the owner barging into the locker room following a loss to officiously instruct big men on how to set better screens. A former assistant coach was floored when Sarver confronted his boss on the way from the court to the coaches' office immediately after the buzzer to berate him on his substitution patterns. Another former coach was taken aback when Sarver marched into the head coach's office at halftime and insisted the team run a trap at an opposing point guard who had abused the Suns' defense.
One insider recalls an evening, following the draft, when Suns brass dined at a notable Phoenix eatery. After the meal, Sarver delivered several pointers on how to improve the operation to the owner, one of the West's leading restaurateurs.
Then there was the time in January 2012 when Sarver dressed down future Hall of Famer Grant Hill in the locker room at halftime for allowing former Sun Vince Carter to go off for a quick 15 points. One of Hill's teammates recently stated that the team found Sarver's actions utterly repugnant. Former players and Suns coaches recount incidents of Sarver baiting opponents from his courtside seat, and even heckling Suns players or roaring to the bench to yank someone from the game.
More than a decade removed from the Seven Seconds or Less team that thrilled both casual fans and basketball junkies, the Suns appear to have no discernible direction. What was one of the most influential franchises in the NBA -- one that both redefined the game and led the way in innovation -- is now one of the league's most beleaguered. Fallow periods are part of the life cycle of most NBA teams, but this Suns' state has become a chronic condition. They're projected to win fewer than 25 games for the fourth consecutive season. They haven't made the playoffs since 2010.
While opinions differ over the primary factors that led to the drought, some consistent themes have emerged in discussions with nearly two dozen NBA insiders -- from current and former Suns players and employees to agents and rival executives who have done business with the organization: an interventionist owner with more authority than expertise, a front office marred by instability, an undermanned scouting department, and a dated facility that isolates the decision-makers from the players and coaches.
""The organization hasn't functioned to the level of mine or our fans' expectations, and that's on me to change,"" Sarver says. ""If I look back, at times I've tried to use a formula I've used in business where I've hired younger folks and tried to mentor them. In my other business, that's been successful. But in this business, I've sometimes underestimated the challenges of the management responsibilities in today's NBA and the experience level it takes to do that.""
Sarver says the Suns will soon begin a search for his next head of basketball operations. The team of James Jones and Trevor Bukstein, who assumed the role of interim co-general managers last October, will be among the candidates.
""We will cast a net around some highly capable and experienced people who can help our organization move forward,"" Sarver says.
Sarver certainly isn't the first owner to preside over his franchise with a heavy hand and heated emotions. And several sources say that in moments of calm, Sarver can be genuinely warm on a personal level. Even those who have been on the receiving end of outbursts say Sarver, at other times, took a sincere interest in their families, or offered thoughtful financial advice.
But just as troubling as invading the work spaces of his players and coaches, say those who have worked for Sarver, is his meddling in personnel decisions. An individual who has worked in the Suns' front office says Sarver, in his best moments, poses challenging questions that can help frame a conversation. But often, process can get derailed by impulse.
Case in point: Earl Watson. After Watson replaced Jeff Hornacek as interim coach midway through 2015-16, the Suns opted against performing a broad search for a permanent replacement, despite the fact that Watson had all of one full season's experience as a D League assistant coach before assuming a spot on Hornacek's bench.Editor's PicksWhy the Celtics are less than the sum of their talented partsThe Celtics entered this season as Eastern Conference favorites but now are left searching for answers.NBA draft lottery: Zion favorites, traded picks and tank racesThe race to the top of the NBA draft is different this season.

The Celtics entered this season as Eastern Conference favorites but now are left searching for answers.
The race to the top of the NBA draft is different this season. Here are our projections.
Several sources say Sarver was the catalyst for fast-tracking Watson's hire, prompted by his conversations with veterans in Phoenix. Then-general manager Ryan McDonough was more apprehensive. Sarver insists that final word on the acquisition of players has fallen to his executives, and denies that he overrode McDonough or any of his GMs on personnel decisions, including Watson, who was out after an unsightly 0-3 start to the 2017-18 season.
""There's a difference between engagement on management and process, as opposed to making draft picks and recommendations, or free-agent recommendations,"" Sarver says. ""At the end of the day, the general manager, in consultation with his staff, decides who we are going to draft.""
Since the departure of Mike D'Antoni from the organization in 2008, the Suns have employed four general managers and seven head coaches. During those 11 years, Sarver has been the only constant in Phoenix. He was the sole decision-maker on the execs and signed off on each of the coaching hires.
For those who have worked in the front office, there's a singular takeaway: Sarver's involvement makes it difficult to lead.
FOUR YEARS AFTER naming McDonough general manager, Sarver acquired some live goats from a Diana Taurasi event at Talking Stick Resort Arena and planted them upstairs in McDonough's office. The stunt was both a practical joke and an inspirational message -- the Suns should find a GOAT of their own, one who dominates like Taurasi. The goats, unaware of their metaphorical connotation, proceeded to defecate all over McDonough's office.
McDonough's stint began auspiciously enough in 2013-14 with a surprising 48-34 record. Sources describe McDonough as an empathetic, well-groomed hand with a deep knowledge of scouting and information-gathering. Many admire the way McDonough approached player evaluation, but his high draft picks yielded few standouts. The Suns mined a gem in Devin Booker in 2015, a solid contributor in T.J. Warren in 2014, and 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton has assembled a solid rookie season.
McDonough was regarded as less capable at communication, people skills and fostering relationships with players. There's a strong sense that McDonough, in a characterization that was made by several sources, prioritized job security ahead of personal conviction. Though Sarver had a tendency to meddle, sources say McDonough's struggles to forcefully make his case on strategy and personnel matters demonstrated his ultimate failing as a GM: an inability to manage an owner.
McDonough's flaws didn't deter Sarver. Moments after McDonough laid eyes on the goats using his office as a loafing shed, the owner extended his GM's contract, even though the Suns had lost more games than the previous campaign in each of the previous two seasons. McDonough had merely asked Sarver for the contract renewals of his scouting staff. In a chipper mood, Sarver told McDonough that he was due for an extension as well.
The months that followed were abject disappointments for the organization. Attempts to surround their draftees with free-agent acquisitions had proved to be disasters, from Brandon Knight's five-year deal in 2015 to Eric Bledsoe, who forced his way out of Phoenix last season and now runs point for the league-leading Bucks. The Suns went from having an awkward logjam at point guard -- Bledsoe, Knight, as well as Goran Dragic -- to having no starter at the position at all. Sources say McDonough's inability to fill that role, a failure that was on full display during the rocky preseason, was the final straw for Sarver.
Though the Suns were only eight days from tip-off of the regular season, McDonough, along with four key members of the front office, were given pink slips.
To replace McDonough, Sarver turned to not one man, but two: Jones, who retired from a 14-year playing career in 2017, and Bukstein, who had been a reliable cap savant and strategist under McDonough. All the while, none of the other front-office vacancies left behind by McDonough's staff was filled.
More than anything, Jones would serve as connective tissue between ""Floor 4,"" where the front office was headquartered, and ""Floor 0,"" the base for players and coaches, including the practice court and locker room. Most NBA teams have created a cohesive flow in their facilities where everyone from the star players to the analytics staffers work in close proximity. The Suns' old, bifurcated layout almost encouraged a silo effect. Any executive who wants to pop in and observe practice must make a 10-minute trek. The net effect is an organization where factionalism is the norm.
The range of opinion on Jones varies greatly. One agent with a client who was disgruntled about his lack of playing time called Jones to express concern, with low expectations in a neophyte executive. Jones deftly mediated the conflict among player, coach and the front office, according to the agent, who says he has rarely seen a touchy matter handled with so much alacrity.
Jones also has helped modernize one of the league's more antiquated training facilities -- including overhauling the weight room -- and continues to improve player amenities, an area where the organization had fallen behind in recent seasons. Jones ensured that a full-time massage therapist travels with the team, something Phoenix hadn't previously provided.
Apart from Jones' contributions to remedy the problematic Floor 4-Floor 0 dynamic, the Suns recently finalized a new $230 million agreement with the city of Phoenix to renovate the arena and construct a new training facility. While the project should help the Suns' ergonomic flow, there remains a vacuum in leadership.
Jones' detractors concede he has fulfilled his role as front-office emissary to the locker room, where players genuinely respect him and have responded to his counsel. But many of those who have observed Jones say that, on his best days, he functions more like a consultant or junior exec in charge of player programs, and less like a commanding general manager, which is his current title.
Multiple sources say Jones often isn't present for strategy and scouting meetings, even when he's not traveling. Jones counters that the division of labor is well-defined, and he finds it unnecessary to stake a claim to tasks that have been rightfully assigned to Bukstein. He doesn't feel the need to exhibit the fake hustle that pervades so many NBA front offices.
""There's a perception of what a GM is and what a GM does, that you have to log the hours and open up the laptop. I've never purported to be that guy,"" Jones says. ""I think it would diminish what Trevor does. He's a star when it comes to the cap, scenario planning, contracts and negotiations. And he's been really good the whole time he's been here. We have different responsibilities. My primary focus has been to manage and improve the performance and relationships within our different units: our coaching, performance team, development. The players -- that has been my focus.""
The division of labor that Jones described hasn't been fully articulated to other front offices, who don't have a strong sense of whom to call in Phoenix to conduct business. Several NBA execs were surprised not to hear from Jones in the weeks after he was named interim general manager. They weren't furnished with a contact card with his information, an act routinely performed when a new GM assumes the title. Few know Bukstein, and some execs find Jones to be inaccessible.The BoardroomExecutive produced by Kevin Durant, The Boardroom explores the most fascinating trends and innovative endeavors across the business of sports, featuring conversations with athletes, executives and business titans.

Jones is universally regarded as bright, but there's a collective sense that he lacks the curiosity or hunger that a relative novice in such a position should display. Former players such as Elton Brand, Malik Rose and Sean Marks throw themselves into every facet of basketball operations, from the G League to cap strategy. In contrast, sources say, Jones seems content to defer to Bukstein. Jones also relies a great deal on another young front-office associate who was initially hired as a liaison between former coach Earl Watson's staff and the analytics department, but has less than two seasons' experience in the NBA. Sources say that much of the Suns' front office finds this confounding.
But the biggest shortcoming, say those who have watched him for the past 19 months, is that Jones routinely misses opportunities to lead.
After the housecleaning in October, which left several jobs vacant, sources say there was no meeting with the staff to explain how responsibilities would be consolidated. Jones didn't gather the troops or make any attempt to inspire after a tumultuous event for the organization. Those who work under him in basketball operations appreciate the guidance he has provided the Suns players. But above all, they crave leadership, and they've been disappointed that Jones hasn't offered the same kind of passion for leading on Floor 4 that he has on Floor 0.
Many NBA organizations suffer from incapable people in positions of power who believe they can lead but can't. The Suns, in the eyes of those both inside and outside the organization, employ an executive in Jones who has the ability to lead, but might not want to.
Adrian Wojnarowski discusses the dysfunction in the Suns' front office as the organization trudges through a disastrous season.
""THE PERCEPTION HERE is that we lose a lot of games, draft in the top five and keep drafting, so we should focus on scouting every player who comes across the board, leave no stone unturned,"" Jones says. ""You can only draft young guys for so long. If you're continuing to draft in the top five it's because the guys you're drafting aren't good, or it can be that the guys you're drafting are good, but you just aren't developing your young prospects.""
Few executives or scouts contacted for this story have run into Jones on the college circuit, despite the fact the Suns hold another valuable pick in the draft. Jones says he has attended approximately 20 college games, though sources in Phoenix say that's a high estimate.
These days, the Suns have far fewer scouts on the road after firing assistant general manager Pat Connelly, a longtime fixture on the scouting circuit who served for years as the Suns' ear to the ground and information gatherer. Courtney Witte, the team's director of scouting was also let go, as was legendary European scout Emilio Kovacic.
Multiple sources say the scouting firings in Phoenix were based on the individual track records of evaluating prospects. Those whose draft boards proved to be prescient were retained, and those with lesser results sacked. Today, Jones says he has the authority to fill these scouting positions, but has elected to keep them vacant.
""One thing to think about was whether or not the size of the scouting staff was adequate, and whether they were efficient or productive,"" Jones says. ""It's more than having people flying all over the country just to say that we are visible and say we were there. If you're utilizing more video and technology, you may not need as much manpower and man-hours.""
To Jones, every year that the draft is the central mission of the Suns is another year when the organization's focus is not the product on the court, but on the spoils that come from losing two-thirds of your games.
Ask around the league and you'll find a few contrarian front-office personnel who, to some extent, quietly agree with Jones' philosophy. There's a belief that scouts can fetishize the road lifestyle and overvalue sitting in lousy seats in college gyms to observe a prospect's body language on the bench or the way he approaches his pregame routine.
But sources say Jones' willful dismissal of scouting denigrates the value of information that can be gathered on-site. It also undermines an inconvenient reality: The Suns have a far better chance of vaulting into the postseason with a homegrown core on rookie deals than they do recruiting championship talent to Phoenix.
A COUPLE MONTHS back, one NBA front office met in its basketball operations conference room to classify the organizational imperatives of each of its 29 rivals. Their assessments were definitive: The Atlanta Hawks were focused on player development and asset acquisition. The Philadelphia 76ers were accelerating their timetable and chasing a title. The LA Clippers were in transition, pursuing multiple tracks simultaneously.
When it came time to identify the broad objectives of the Suns, the group was at a loss. Though the Phoenix roster featured five lottery picks under the age of 23, the team had pursued veterans such as Trevor Ariza and Jamal Crawford in free agency and were starting Ryan Anderson. Though none of the models projected the Suns to qualify for the playoffs and they still lacked a starting point guard, there was reliable intel that some in the Phoenix organization wanted to make a push for the postseason. They were preserving their cap space ... wait, or were they? What was  the plan in Phoenix?2019 NBA draftGet ready for Zion Williamson, Ja Morant and more.• Latest NBA mock draft

Even those who express disappointment in Jones concede he was provided with virtually no mentorship or immersive education that could help him address that daunting question. In many respects, Jones' predicament is reflective of the unsteadiness in Phoenix that leaves so many in the organization uneasy about the future.
Sources say the coaching staff led by Igor Kokoskov is frustrated by a lack of direction as well. They are no less in the dark on the plan in Phoenix than the rest of the league. Moreover, the executive that hired the staff has been fired, and they're unsure of where they stand with the current interim administration.
No one in Phoenix has a strong sense of whether Sarver will install Jones and Bukstein as the permanent managerial team, or if he will look outside the organization for a president of basketball operations. If it's the latter, would the new executive overhaul the front office and eject those who survived the October purge?
The sheer range of scenarios has created an unsettled atmosphere, though Jones is confident he and Bukstein work as a permanent duo.
""I know that Trevor and I can lead us forward,"" Jones says.
That befuddled front office never came up with a satisfying answer about the Suns' organizational plan. Meanwhile, in Phoenix, there's a palpable fear that nobody is even asking the question.

26193347,"""I expected a canned response,"" her father Chris told ESPN.
The letter from November led to a company-wide change to list sneakers in unisex sizing, with search results on the brand's website now showing all basketball products for men, women, boys and girls.
""I was immediately impressed when I saw Riley's letter; that a 9-year-old girl had the courage to use her voice to call attention to an issue and keep us accountable,"" Curry said.
Almost instantly, Curry called on his team at Under Armour to not only update the website search system but to also create a path to work with Riley on a colorway of his newest signature shoe. Curry's own handwritten response immediately went viral as well.
With International Women's Day serving as the perfect platform, the purple orchid, grey and white colorway was crafted, and features more handwriting from Morrison, in the form of aspirational phrases and sketches of girls playing basketball along the shoe's sockliner.
""She was focused on the opportunity for all girls, not just herself,"" Curry added. ""She's been an amazing catalyst for change -- not only with my product but also with the entire Under Armour brand. She is inspiring, and wise beyond her years.""
To celebrate the launch, Curry invited Riley from her hometown in nearby Napa, California, to the Warriors' home game against the Denver Nuggets. It was there that Curry also announced that all sales from the purple Curry 6 would help to fund a two-year, $30,000 scholarship for an aspiring graduating female high school student from the San Francisco Bay Area. The first recipient of the scholarship, Vivian Wu, was on hand to receive the award from both Curry and Morrison.
""Just a reminder that one small gesture can lead to something truly special,"" Curry wrote in an Instagram caption after the game.
 Just a reminder that one small gesture can lead to something truly special 🙏🏽! From a handwritten note 📝 to a $30k scholarship for Vivian Wu to pursue higher education in STEM. Riley Morrison changed the game. Happy for @ayeshacurry & I to be a part of this journey...#internationalwomensday

This past week saw moments and milestones extend far beyond just the game, as LeBron James also celebrated an achievement he couldn't imagine.
As he was expected to pass Michael Jordan on the league's all-time scoring list, James and Nike worked up a detailed and inspired pair of his new LeBron 16 sneakers months ago, just for the occasion.
His latest signature shoe featured updated panels and design elements drafting off of the iconic Air Jordan 3, the shoe James wore as a tribute during one of his first preseason games as a pro in 2003. James wore two pairs during Wednesday's game, one with yellow laces during the first half, another with purple laces for the second half.
At halftime, he added his own handwritten inscription to the left shoe's midsole: ""Thank You M.J.""
""For a kid from Akron, Ohio, that needed inspiration and needed some type of positive influence, MJ was that guy for me,"" James said after the game. ""I watched him from afar, wanted to be like MJ, wanted to shoot fadeaways like MJ, wanted to stick my tongue out on dunks like MJ, wanted to wear my sneakers like MJ. I wanted kids to look up to me at some point like MJ and it's just crazy, to be honest. It's beyond crazy.""

Rockets wing PJ Tucker continued his impossible-to-top run of rare and exclusive sneakers, breaking out a pair of the Nike KD 3 originally thought to be made for only Kevin Durant.
""I've known KD for so long,"" said Tucker, who hosted Durant on his recruiting tour at Texas. ""We've been friends for years and I've always loved his sneakers.""
Featuring upgraded leather and faux horsehair along the collar, the pair was made for KD's reign over the league's short-lived H-O-R-S-E contest during the 2011 All-Star Weekend. The heel features a hilarious caricature of a horse shooting a jumper.
""This pair took me a long time to get,"" Tucker said. ""I sent him a picture, and his response was classic. We always talk and I always send him pictures when I get his old stuff. He literally said, 'PJ, I really don't think I even have a pair.'""
Durant typically wears a size 17 or 18. The fact Tucker tracked down his size 14 baffled even some of the Nike Basketball folks who worked on the shoe.
""I don't know many other people with this pair right here,"" he added. ""This pair is special for me.""
While he hasn't yet decided if he'll be retiring this spring or not, Vince Carter has been turning back the clock all season long in the Nike Shox BB4, the sneaker he headlined nearly two decades ago when he first signed with Nike, as he leapfrogged a human during the 2000 Olympics.
""The BB4 is where it started. It changed the game as far as the look,"" Carter recently told Nice Kicks. ""You didn't see a shoe that looked like that or was built that way.""
Nike has made him a handful of exclusive colorways to wear all season, and plans to re-release the shoe this year. The latest pair he debuted honored his team at the time of the original launch, the Toronto Raptors, with textures and graphics inspired by the team's mascot.
""It's something that I had been wanting to do. People had been asking me [about the shoe] for a long time,"" he added. ""I had asked [Nike] to bring them back a couple of years ago and I guess they just weren't ready to for whatever reason. I'm just glad it's back now. It's been a hit.""
Elsewhere in the league, DeMar DeRozan and Trae Young both debuted detailed editions of their latest sneakers, both of which were actually originally made in case they were named to the recent NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte, North Carolina. Young's laceless pair of the Adidas N3XT L3V3L feature a NASCAR-inspired series of touches honoring the host city, from a checkered flag graphic upper to gradient fading colors inspired by the veering race cars. DeRozan's latest Kobe 4 Protro colorway is accented by a gleaming chrome heel counter and grid map detailing along the toe.

26106848,"The battles for home court in the first round of the playoffs are heating up as we hit March. Which teams are in the driver's seat to host an opening-round matchup?
Throughout the regular season, our panel (ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz, Tim MacMahon and Andre' Snellings, The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears and FiveThirtyEight's Chris Herring) ranks all 30 teams from top to bottom, taking stock of which are playing the best basketball and which are looking most like title contenders.
Previous rankings: Week 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | Training camp | Free agency
1. Milwaukee Bucks
Record: 48-15
Dealing with an array of injuries as his team prepared to take on the Jazz, Mike Budenholzer rolled out a starting five with four players who stand 6-foot-10 or taller, making it the NBA's tallest starting lineup since 2003. On some level, it worked: The Bucks jumped out to a 11-0 lead to begin the game, and their No. 1 defense reduced Rudy Gobert to a terrible showing. Yet Donovan Mitchell finished with 46 points, and cited the big lineup's lack of foot speed as a reason for Utah's comeback victory. -- Herring
2. Golden State Warriors
Record: 44-19
Despite losing two of their past three, the Warriors are now 21-11 on the road this season and are the only team in the Western Conference with more than 18 road wins. Golden State has also secured a winning road record for a franchise-best sixth consecutive season. Previously, the Warriors had seven total seasons with a winning road record in its 67-year history, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. -- Spears
3. Toronto Raptors
Record: 46-18
We know the Raptors are dangerous, and with the recent acquisitions that has never been more true. The question that has loomed for much of the season has surrounded whether a unit that has been together only sporadically has logged enough time on the floor to fully realize its potential. Load management aside, the quartet of Kyle Lowry, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard and Pascal Siakam have outscored opponents by 21.9 points per 100 possessions since the All-Star break, whether Marc Gasol or Serge Ibaka is the man in the middle. -- Arnovitz
4. Denver Nuggets
Record: 42-20
On Saturday, the Nuggets started their preferred lineup of Nikola Jokic, Paul Millsap, Will Barton, Gary Harris and Jamal Murray for the first time since Oct. 20 after battling a series of injuries all season. The Nuggets have a 3.5-game lead for second place in the West, which affords them some time and opportunity for their lineup to mesh and find their level over the final 20 regular-season games before the playoffs begin. -- Snellings
5. Portland Trail Blazers
Record: 39-24
The Blazers had to be ecstatic that newcomer Rodney Hood finally had a breakthrough game. The veteran swingman had 27 points, all after the 2:27 mark in the third quarter, in a win at Charlotte on Sunday. Hood had missed 25 of 32 field goal attempts and nine of 10 3-pointers in the previous five games. -- Spears
6. Houston Rockets
Record: 38-25
The Rockets are 12-0 when Chris Paul dishes out at least 10 assists. That includes three games during Houston's current five-game winning streak, when Paul is also averaging 17.8 points per game. ""He's being aggressive, and that's what we need,"" James Harden said. Paul's aggressiveness eases the burden on Harden, but the reigning MVP is still carrying a historic load, averaging 39.5 points in four games since recovering from a cervical strain. -- MacMahon
7. Philadelphia 76ers
Record: 40-23
It's difficult to make wholesale evaluations about the Sixers' potential this spring while Joel Embiid remains sidelined with tendinitis in his left knee. The team is 3-2 during his recent absence, with Tobias Harris as its leading scorer -- 24.8 points, 8.6 rebounds, two assists and a block per game. Tied with the short-handed Pacers in the loss column, and 2.5 games up on Boston, the Sixers have the inside track to the third seed, their path of least resistance in the Eastern Conference this spring. -- Arnovitz
8. Oklahoma City Thunder
Record: 39-24
The Thunder have lost five of their past seven games, and are in clear danger of sliding down to the 5-seed in the West. Paul George has missed three straight games with a right shoulder injury, and his health is paramount. If George and Russell Westbrook are both healthy going into the playoffs, the Thunder will have a puncher's chance against any opponent, regardless of their ultimate playoff seeding. -- Snellings
9. Utah Jazz
Record: 36-26
Coming off wins over the Nuggets and Bucks, the Jazz have the No. 3 seed in the West in their sights. Utah is two games behind the Thunder and Trail Blazers now and has the NBA's softest schedule in the final quarter of the season. Speaking of finishing strong, Donovan Mitchell scored 28 points on 11-of-16 shooting in the fourth quarters of those wins over Denver and Milwaukee. -- MacMahon
10. Indiana Pacers
Record: 41-23
It was a tough week for the Pacers, who dropped three of their four games while also losing hyper-efficient big man Domantas Sabonis toward the end of their loss in Detroit. The common denominator in three defeats: The Pacers' opponents shot far better from the arc in those games than Indiana did. In their lone victory, over Minnesota, the Pacers caught fire from deep, drilling 16 of 27 attempts that night. -- Herring
11. San Antonio Spurs
Record: 35-29
Once again, the Spurs have shown signs of life after sinking to historic lows. San Antonio has never had a worse Rodeo Trip than the 1-7 odyssey the Spurs just wrapped up, which included five double-digit losses. But the Spurs bounced back immediately by beating the Pistons and Thunder at home, holding on to one of the West's last playoff spots. -- MacMahon
12. LA Clippers
Record: 36-29
The reconstituted Clippers are now 6-3, making good on owner Steve Ballmer's desire to qualify for the postseason, lottery pick be damned. Among the reinforcements, rookie shooting guard Landry Shamet has been a boon for the playoff drive -- 12.4 points in 28.1 minutes per game on a true shooting percentage of 64.8, including a 46.6 percent clip from beyond the arc. -- Arnovitz
13. Boston Celtics
Record: 38-26
The Celtics have to decide who they are moving into the postseason. They are not the prohibitive favorite to come out of the East that they were when the season began, but they can't afford to be an unformed, ""potential"" squad when the playoffs begin or their postseason will end quickly. They have just over a month to establish the team hierarchy and lean into their roles, and their current stretch of seven losses in 10 games reflects the growing pains of that effort. -- Snellings
14. Detroit Pistons
Record: 31-31
No team has been more efficient on offense over the past month than the Pistons, who, after their Sunday win against Toronto, are averaging 118.1 points per 100 possessions in that span. The run doesn't figure to hold forever. Before this recent stretch, that has seen them hit 40.9 percent of their 3-pointers (second best in the NBA), the Pistons ranked dead last in 3-point shooting. But the timing couldn't be better as Detroit attempts to close in on a playoff spot for just the second time in 10 seasons. -- Herring
15. Brooklyn Nets
Record: 32-33
Saturday's loss at Miami, one of their ugliest of the season, dropped the Nets below .500 for the first time since Jan. 16. Brooklyn has sculpted an identity as a free-flowing team of perimeter players, often surrounding just a single big man. But right now, the Nets are getting annihilated on the glass. After ranking league average for much of the season, the Nets' team rebounding rate since the All-Star break stands below 46 percent -- only Phoenix has been worse. -- Arnovitz
16. Sacramento Kings
Record: 31-31
Marvin Bagley III enjoyed his best month of his young career in February before spraining his left knee last Wednesday against Milwaukee. The rookie forward averaged 17.9 points and 9.4 rebounds in just 20.9 minutes per game. The Kings are leaning on rookie forward Harry Giles in Bagley's absence. -- Spears
17. Orlando Magic
Record: 30-35
The Magic have won nine of their past 12 games to surge into a tie for eighth in the East, including impressive wins over the Warriors, at the Bucks and at the Raptors. Their only stumbling blocks of late have been teams deep in the lottery, as their most recent losses have been to the Bulls, Knicks and Cavaliers. After their next game in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the Magic play seven straight games against teams on pace for the lottery. -- Snellings
18. Los Angeles Lakers
Record: 30-33
We hear a lot about the ""statement win"" for an aspirational team looking to forge an identity, but on Saturday, the Lakers gave us the definitive statement loss at Phoenix. Though the Lakers were playing the second of a back-to-back, they surrendered 118 points in 97 possessions to the league's No. 29 offense. Once an overachieving defensive unit that was quick to react, the Lakers rank bottom 10 since the calendar flipped to 2019 -- and bottom five on the defensive glass. -- Arnovitz
19. Minnesota Timberwolves
Record: 29-34
About the only bright spot on the Wolves' disappointing and injury-plagued season is the play of Karl-Anthony Towns. The two-time All-Star has scored at least 30 in the past three games and is on pace to set career-highs in points, rebounds and blocks per game. -- Spears
20. Miami Heat
Record: 28-34
The Heat have curbed their free-fall, winning two of their past three after having lost nine of the previous 11. All three efforts were impressive, with a Dwyane Wade game winner over the Warriors, a close loss at the Rockets and a blowout win over the Nets indicating that the Heat are currently playing at a level consistent with the best in the league. They'll need to maintain that level to get into the postseason, as they remain just outside of the eighth seed in the East. -- Snellings
21. Charlotte Hornets
Record: 29-34
Sources said Hornets forward Frank Kaminsky was interested in getting a buyout due to his minimal role, but Charlotte wasn't interested in giving him one before Friday's deadline to be playoff eligible elsewhere. Kaminsky was averaging career-lows of 5.2 points, 2.4 rebounds and 10.4 minutes per game entering Thursday and had played in just three games since Jan. 1. But over the past two games, Kaminsky has averaged 16.5 points and 7.0 rebounds. -- Spears
22. New Orleans Pelicans
Record: 29-36
As the awkward saga with Anthony Davis continues, Jrue Holiday continues to be a steady star for the Pelicans, averaging 22 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds and 2 steals per game since the All-Star break despite decreased minutes. The Pelicans are 3-3 in that span, including wins in both games that Davis sat out. New Orleans has an interesting decision to make with the 28-year-old Holiday. Do they want him to be the leader of the post-AD era or cash in on his tremendous value in the trade market? -- MacMahon
23. Washington Wizards
Record: 26-37
There isn't much joy these days in watching the Wizards close out what has been a brutal season so far. The novelty of Bobby Portis and Jabari Parker has largely worn off, and All-Star Bradley Beal can do only so much by himself. But 21-year-old big man Thomas Bryant has been one of the team's few bright spots, and has illustrated he can likely be a solid rotation piece going forward. -- Herring
24. Dallas Mavericks
Record: 27-35
The Mavs, who traded 80 percent of their starting lineup and will wait until next season to reap the benefits with Kristaps Porzingis, are as bad as anyone right now. They have a net rating of minus-12.2 over the past seven games, managing to win only one of those. Dallas is the NBA's worst defensive (116.7 points allowed per 100 possessions) and rebounding (46.6 percent rate) team in that stretch. -- MacMahon
25. Chicago Bulls
Record: 18-46
The Bulls have averaged 115.5 points per 100 possessions over the past month of play -- fourth in the NBA during that stretch, and slightly better than the two-time defending champion Warriors. They exploded for 168 points in a four-OT victory over Atlanta on Friday. The flip side of all this, both in that win and over the past month generally, is that they've given up nearly just as many scores on the other end of the floor. Getting back Wendell Carter Jr., should he be able to return to the lineup before season's end, would likely help shore up the defense. -- Herring
26. Atlanta Hawks
Record: 22-42
These days, the only way to slow down Trae Young is to eject him, as officials did on Sunday in Chicago when the Hawks rookie buried a 3-pointer from 30 feet then stared down Kris Dunn. Entering play on Sunday, Young had averaged 25.3 points, 9.8 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game since Feb. 1, with a true shooting percentage of 58.7. -- Arnovitz
27. Memphis Grizzlies
Record: 25-40
Give coach J.B. Bickerstaff's Grizzlies credit for playing hard despite the odds and all the turmoil. Memphis ranks first in the league in defensive rating since the All-Star break, allowing only 101 points per 100 possessions. Chandler Parsons' shooting hasn't been pretty (23.6 field goal percentage since returning from his forced sabbatical), but opponents are scoring only 86.8 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor in the past six games. -- MacMahon
28. Cleveland Cavaliers
Record: 16-48
Cedi Osman has logged double figures in each of his past 12 games, the longest streak of his career. During that span, the 23-year-old has averaged 18.5 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.4 assists on 53.9 percent shooting overall and 50 percent from 3-point range. Cleveland has won six of the past 12 games Osman has played in. -- Herring
29. Phoenix Suns
Record: 13-51
Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 pick in the 2018 NBA draft, may have played his most impressive game as a pro in a win over LeBron James and the Lakers on Saturday. Offensively, Ayton had 26 points on 11 shots with 10 rebounds and 3 assists. Defensively, the 7-footer surprisingly guarded James well for most of the contest and had two steals and a block. -- Spears
30. New York Knicks
Record: 13-50
The Knicks have a 4.5-game ""lead"" on the Bulls to retain one of the top-three lottery positions, a strong cushion with less than 20 games remaining in the season. This frees them up to play the best basketball that their young core can manage, as these young guys are given a rest-of-the-season tryout for a spot in the future. Mitchell Robinson's electric play of late is building a buzz of excitement among Knicks fans. -- Snellings
"
26066451,"NEW ORLEANS -- A 128-115 loss to the Anthony Davis-less New Orleans Pelicans left LeBron James questioning whether his Los Angeles Lakers teammates have the experience to grasp the challenge at hand and help the franchise qualify for the playoffs for the first time in six years.
""How many know what's at stake if you've never been there?"" James asked Saturday after L.A. went down by as many as 20 points to a Pelicans team that was resting Davis and came into the night eight games under .500.
""I'm playing devil's advocate, you know? It's kind of a fine line when you talk about that, because when you've never been there or know what it takes to actually shoot for something like that, sometimes you're afraid to get uncomfortable.
""So you got to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. So I'm not saying that's what we are as a whole. It kind of looks that way at times, that sometimes we're afraid to be uncomfortable and kind of get out of our comfort zone and kind of, you know, have that sense of urgency from the jump, and not be afraid to actually go out and fail to succeed. So I mean, we have, what -- 23 games left? We'll see what happens.""
Pelicans star Anthony Davis didn't play against the Lakers on Saturday, but coach Alvin Gentry said the decision wasn't made because the team was playing Los Angeles.
The Sacramento Kings also beat the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night, leaving the 29-30 Lakers two games behind the Kings for the No. 9 spot in the Western Conference and 3½ games behind the LA Clippers and San Antonio Spurs, who currently occupy the final two playoff spots in the West.
James has made the NBA Finals the past eight years and the playoffs the past 13 years after failing to make the postseason in each of his first two seasons in the league. He has played 239 playoff games in his career. The 11 other Lakers to see the court Saturday have played 289 combined, with five of them -- Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Moe Wagner and Alex Caruso -- having never been there at all.
""The last few years, everyone's so accustomed to the losses that I'm just not accustomed to,"" James said. ""I'm not accustomed to it. I will never get comfortable with losing. So losing Game 1 to Houston [at home], it feels the same way as losing Game 59 in New Orleans to me. It's just how I'm built. That's who I am.""
James' message echoed his sentiments during the first season of his second stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014-15, when he challenged the ""bad habits"" of teammates Kyrie Irving and Dion Waiters, who at the time had also never seen playoff action.
However, James made those comments in November of that season. It's now late February. James admitted that he expected a learning curve with the Lakers. He just didn't expect for that curve to continue this far into the season.
""I knew it was going to be very challenging,"" James said. ""Just because of the experience the roster had at that point and time. I knew it was going to be challenging from that sense, but I felt like we could still play better basketball. And we were doing that and obviously it sucks that my injury happened and [Lonzo Ball's] injury happened and so many of our injuries happened.""
Ball's severe left ankle sprain in mid-January coincided with the Lakers' defense completely disappearing. L.A. has now allowed at least 115 points in nine consecutive road games, tied for the longest streak in franchise history, according to data compiled by ESPN Stats & Information.
Rajon Rondo said the team's defense is the biggest issue the Lakers face, followed by the need to ""play for each other"" more often.
""We have no other choice,"" Rondo said of the defense. ""It's either we do or we don't. We do, we make the playoffs, and still with that mindset if we do, if we get in the playoffs we can easily get swept in four games. So we have to start buying into the scouting report and start buying into each other and start to play for each other a lot more.""
The Pelicans did exactly that with Davis out, getting big nights out of Jrue Holiday (27 points, 7 assists), former Laker Julius Randle (24 points, 5 assists), Elfrid Payton (14 points, 9 assists) and Cheick Diallo, who went 8-for-8 in 19 minutes off the bench, amassing 18 points, 10 rebounds and two blocks. The Lakers also helped out New Orleans by committing 23 turnovers.
Kuzma, who spoke about how James' defensive effort made a big impact in the Lakers' second-half comeback win over Houston on Thursday night, might have made another veiled reference to James on Saturday when asked whether he's questioning the team's ability to make a push for the postseason.
""I just think we got to be consistent,"" he said. ""We got to be consistent with everything. We got to be consistent with our body languages, our effort. As a whole, we're just not consistent.""
L.A. will finish its two-game road trip in Memphis on Monday before returning home to host the Pelicans on Wednesday.
""I'm so huge on chemistry and camaraderie, and throughout the course of the season with injuries ... [they] have felt like it's taken a toll on our team,"" James said. ""So hopefully we can get Zo back soon to kind of help that out. And hopefully we can start playing a little bit better, too.""

26105395,"IT WAS SPRING 2017, and LeBron James passed Michael Jordan in scoring.
It was a triumphant night, the Cleveland Cavaliers closing out the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals to head back to defend their title. A 3-pointer in the third quarter got James beyond Jordan's career playoff scoring record of 5,987 points. A testament to excellence and longevity.
Teammate Kyrie Irving, who would play only five more games with James before demanding a trade to get away from him, approached James on the bench after the accomplishment, whispered congratulations in his ear and encouraged him to celebrate the moment.
""I did pretty much everything that MJ did when I was a kid,"" James said that night, relishing the record. ""I shot fadeaways before I should have. I wore a leg sleeve on my leg and folded it down so you saw the red part. I wore black and red shoes with white socks. I wore short shorts so you could see my undershorts underneath. I didn't go bald like Mike, but I'm getting there.""
IT WAS SPRING 2018, and LeBron James passed Michael Jordan in scoring.
It was a triumphant night, the Cavs beating the New Orleans Pelicans in a game that helped secure their playoff seed. It was James' 867th consecutive game in double figures, breaking Jordan's all-time record. A testament to excellence and longevity.
The referees came to him during a stoppage in play and handed him the ball, which he held over his head while the crowd gave him a standing ovation. On the slam dunk that officially set the record, Kevin Love, James' remaining All-Star teammate, gave a double fist pump and embraced him as James ran up the floor. Justin Timberlake high-fived him from a courtside seat.
""That's a good moment, a special moment not only for myself, but for my family and for so many kids that look up to me for inspiration to know that you can actually go out there and do it and know where I've come from,"" James said that night. ""You know, brought up 30 minutes south of here, and the statistics is always stacked up against you, and for me to be in this position today, being able to accomplish something that a lot of people thought would not happen again or be able to break a record like that.""
Brian Windhorst gives his insight as to how LeBron wants to be remembered in the annals of NBA history.
IT'S NEARLY SPRING OF 2019, and LeBron James has passed Michael Jordan in scoring.
He needed 13 points against the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night to pass Jordan for fourth on the NBA's all-time scoring list with 32,292 points. Once again, it's a testament to excellence and longevity. James scored his milestone points on an and-1 driving basket midway through the second quarter.
James will be humbled by this, as he has by all these Jordan scoring marks. Moving alongside Jordan in any category is an honor, though it must be pointed out James has played more than 100 more regular-season games than Jordan did to reach this number. It is an accomplishment James owes to tremendous focus on both physical and mental well-being that has enabled him to operate at such a high level for 16 seasons. Jordan, who had two comebacks from retirement, played 15 total seasons.
But the celebration for this particular Jordan scoring record is probably going to be muted. There isn't much that is triumphant about this season for James, one in which he's in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. And a big reason is because there isn't another All-Star on the roster with whom to celebrate this honor.
Last week, after the Lakers lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in a game in which James led a valiant but ultimately fruitless effort, he said something that essentially summed up the season.
""Everybody tends to talk about Giannis [Antetokounmpo] so much, but it's the supporting cast that he has, those guys go out and do their job every single night,"" James said. ""Obviously, [Eric Bledsoe] ... then [Khris] Middleton being an All-Star, [Malcolm] Brogdon being a former Rookie of the Year, they've surrounded Giannis with a great cast.""
To be clear, James wasn't trying to put down his team by complimenting the Bucks. He was just complimenting the Bucks. But the reality is this is the most challenged team James has been on in a decade. He has reached eight straight NBA Finals, and the two seasons before that streak started, he was a part of back-to-back 60-win teams.
This season is the first time since 2009-10 that James hasn't played with another All-Star. Most of those seasons -- be it with Love and Irving or Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh -- he played with two.
The Lakers' season is close to over. What's next?
• Lowe: LeBron vs. MJ implications
• Next three steps for the Lakers
• Will LeBron ever pass Kareem?
• This front office needs a new approach
Passing Jordan in a scoring mark should never be taken for granted; it's a moment. There will be another game ball to be displayed in a LeBron James museum someday. But this Lakers team isn't getting him toward the Jordan mark he'd really like: the six titles.
James has mostly given up that pursuit. He feels his legacy is set, regardless of what the public debate on the matter might be. Not that he wants to stop trying.
Just a few weeks ago, he articulated this when he said: ""There's nothing I need to get in this league that I don't already have. Everything else for me is just like icing on the cake. ... There's nothing I'm chasing or feel like I need to end my career on.""
Right now, the idea of chasing anything personal is on the back burner. James is spending his days chasing the No. 8 seed. Scoring records -- Kobe Bryant at No. 3 is up next and attainable by next season, assuming good health, and overall leader Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would take four to five more great years -- have faded in importance for the moment.
If there is a final word on the matter, James has never wanted to be known as a scorer. He would much rather be known as a passer. And if they ever do put up a statue in Cleveland, he'd like it to be of his greatest career moment: a blocked shot in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals.
So passing Jordan yet again has become a nice spring ritual but not a life pursuit.
""I don't have to score the ball to make an impact in the basketball game. That was my mindset when I started playing the game,"" James said last year. ""And it's going to carry me for the rest of my career.""

26210169,"LOS ANGELES -- Lonzo Ball will miss the remainder of the Los Angeles Lakers' fading season, sources confirmed to ESPN, joining teammate Brandon Ingram on the sideline for the rest of the team's disappointing campaign.
Sources said Ball has been shut down after trying to make his way back from a Grade 3 ankle sprain and bone bruise first suffered Jan. 19.
The second-year point guard met again with team doctors Saturday. In a statement issued after the team's 120-107 loss to the Boston Celtics on Saturday night, the Lakers would only say that Ball is making ""good progress"" in his recovery and will be re-evaluated again in two weeks. The Lakers (30-36) have a month left to play in the regular season and sit seven games out of a playoff spot.
Ingram has been diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis in his ailing right arm. A source said Ingram hopes to know more about his condition Monday. Coach Luke Walton was tight-lipped Saturday on any further details, other than to say the third-year forward is out for the season.
Ingram had missed the past two games after Walton said he had difficulty raising his arm without pain.
Further tests revealed his diagnosis, which is caused by a blood clot and is frequently accompanied by swelling and pain in a limb. It usually occurs in legs but can occur in the upper body, too.
With a banged-up roster and playoff hopes dashed, how should the Lakers move forward?
Kyrie Irving has been captain of what, at times, has been Team Turmoil. It has been one of his primary takeaways from his time with LeBron James.
Ingram was playing the best basketball of his career. The Duke product averaged a career-best 18.3 points and 5.1 rebounds per game this season, but he had thrived since the All-Star break, averaging 27.8 points and 57 percent shooting in six games.
""When it rains it pours,"" guard Rajon Rondo said about Ingram's season-ending condition and the other injuries the Lakers have endured this season.
According to Second Spectrum data, Ingram averaged 1.15 points per direct isolation play since Jan. 28, when the Anthony Davis trade demand put his future with the Lakers into question. That figure was tied for third in the league behind Kawhi Leonard and Zach LaVine over that span.
Walton would not go into further detail about Ingram's condition.
""We've released what he's got going on, but I'm not going to get into all the details,'' Walton said. ""I'm just finding out a lot of it myself. All I'm going to say on him right now is that he's out for the rest of the season.''
Prominent athletes such as Chris Bosh and Serena Williams have been diagnosed with blood clots in recent years. Bosh had to retire because of blood clotting issues.
Ramona Shelburne breaks down how the season might continue with all the injuries to the Lakers' young talent.
Ball recently had been seen doing some shooting without jumping and dribbling exercises on the court. He suffered his Grade 3 sprain at Houston on Jan. 19, then later had a bone bruise that slowed his recovery.
The Lakers hope that Ball, 21, will be able to heal fully and have time to work on his game this offseason. Last summer, Ball stayed off an injured knee to let it heal, only to have to undergo surgery later to repair a torn meniscus, preventing him from working on his game during the offseason.
""From my eye, not being a doctor, he's not quite ready,"" Walton said before Ball was shut down.
With the Lakers' season fading as they fall further out of playoff contention, the organization will play it safe with its young players. Kyle Kuzma also missed his second consecutive game Saturday night after rolling his ankle last week. And Josh Hart continues to play despite knee tendinitis that has been bothering him for a few months.
Hart said nothing has helped in his efforts to relieve the pain in his knee, but he wants to avoid joining Ball and Ingram on the sideline for the remainder of the season.
""I don't want to give up on this team,"" Hart said when asked if being shut down might be a consideration. ""I'm going to play as hard as I can for however long I can. Obviously at the end of the day, I got to make sure I don't make the damage worse. But I want to go out there and compete and play every game as best as I can.""
The Lakers went 15-8 when LeBron James, Ingram and Ball all played this season. However, the team is just 15-28 (including Saturday's loss to Boston) when at least one did not play, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The trio has not been on the court together since Christmas Day.
The Athletic first reported Ball would be shut down after his latest medical evaluation Saturday.

26004117,"The New Orleans Pelicans have parted ways with general manager Dell Demps, the team announced on Friday, clearing the way for a new top basketball executive to oversee the Anthony Davis trade talks.
Demps had been Pelicans GM for nine years, which included three trips to the playoffs but advancing only once past the first round.
""I would like to extend my appreciation to Dell for his tireless work and commitment to our team over the last eight-plus years,"" Pelicans owner Gayle Benson said in a statement. ""Dell, his wife Anita, and his family have been a credit to our city and I wish them nothing but the greatest success going forward.""
Former Cleveland Cavaliers and Atlanta Hawks GM Danny Ferry, a consultant for the Pelicans, has been named the team's interim GM. New Orleans assistant GM David Booth was also considered for the interim role, league sources said.
""My focus for the rest of the season is to provide leadership to our basketball operations group and give [coach] Alvin [Gentry] and our players the resources and support to positively impact the culture and foundation now and going forward,"" Ferry said in a statement.
For now, Gentry and his staff are safe, sources said. The organization has been pleased with how he's navigated the team under difficult circumstances this year, and he's expected to finish out the season, sources said.
Gentry's future is likely dependent on the next GM's purview. Gentry signed a contract extension in the offseason.
What should be the next steps for New Orleans after firing GM Dell Demps?
Pelicans star Anthony Davis suffered a muscle contusion in his left shoulder Thursday against the Thunder but ""nothing too bad,"" a source told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne.
Benson has been angry over the Davis trade demand and her belief that ""outside forces"" are trying to push the franchise into decisions that don't make sense, league sources said.
Her mandate has been to ""take back control from outside forces,"" one league source told ESPN. Benson has been adamant with the organization about finding a pathway to sustainable winning in one of the league's smallest markets and plans to be aggressive in pursuing the best available candidates to oversee basketball operations, league sources said.
""We will immediately begin the process of restructuring our basketball operations department,"" Benson said. ""This will include a comprehensive, but confidential, search aided by outside consultants to identify a new leader of our basketball operations, directly reporting to me.""
Among preliminary possible candidates, league sources tell ESPN: former Cleveland GM David Griffin.
Benson owns the Pelicans and the New Orleans Saints and had Demps reporting to Saints GM and Pelicans head of basketball operations Mickey Loomis. The Pelicans are eager to conduct a search that will attract a top basketball executive who will take on a more prominent role in the franchise. Benson is promising to pursue a top-level GM to revitalize a franchise that's coming to a crossroads with the Davis trade.
Davis can become a free agent in July 2020 but publicly demanded a trade on Jan. 28. The Pelicans refused to negotiate with the Lakers, who made offers in hopes of landing Davis prior to the Feb. 7 deadline.
The Pelicans have endured a succession of trades and missed draft picks that have depleted the roster of a sustainable path to long-term success, but Benson hopes the team remains competitive this season.
""My expectations, and the expectations of our fans, are that this team will compete at a high level for the remainder of the season,"" Benson said.
The team is 26-33 after beating the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday night, but is six games behind the LA Clippers for the final Western Conference postseason spot.
"
26100976,"""It was an honest conversation,"" Walton said. ""It was healthy and positive.""
Perhaps more important was that Rondo was feeling healthy again. He returned to the Lakers from the All-Star break with a stiff back that had limited him to a total of 11 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds in the Lakers' first three games back.
With the awkwardness of Anthony Davis's visit behind them, the Lakers can now focus on moving past the failed trade negotiations and making the postseason.
Despite his dour outlook after losses to the Pelicans and Grizzlies, LeBron James took a more positive outlook in L.A. on Wednesday, saying of the Lakers, ""I like where we are today.""
After losses at New Orleans and Memphis, Walton opted to insert Rondo into the starting lineup on Wednesday. Rondo responded with 11 points, 16 assists and seven rebounds to help LeBron James and the Lakers snap a two-game slide with a 125-119 win over the New Orleans Pelicans.
James delivered 33 points, 10 assists and six rebounds. Three of his points came on a tightly contested, shot-clock-beating corner 3-pointer off one leg with 31.3 seconds left that gave the Lakers a six-point lead.
Rondo was feeling much better, and it showed. He said he had been suffering from back pain for about four days, and he had difficulty getting out of bed.
""I think I slept on a bad bed in Jamaica,"" Rondo told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne about what slowed the veteran point guard down the past few games.
Looking for anything that could spark the Lakers, Walton started Rondo, Reggie Bullock, Brandon Ingram, James and Kyle Kuzma against the bigger Pelicans, who played Anthony Davis for 20 minutes.
Rondo dished five assists in the third quarter and then found his shot in the fourth when he made three of four shots and scored seven of his points.
""I think with Zo [Lonzo Ball] out and our turnover situation as of late, just bringing another ball handler in there, another natural point guard in there, will just help us all,"" James told ESPN's Dave McMenamin of Rondo starting with Ball out with a Grade 3 sprained ankle. ""With me and B.I. [Ingram] not having to have all the ball-handling responsibilities in the first lineup, bringing 'Do [Rondo] in there, it just gives us another mind first of all. The cerebral part of it all is huge. And then it just keeps us with some stability out there.
""We were able to get pace. We had 19 fast-break points. We had 37 assists. Between me and 'Do, we had 26 assists and [the team] only had eight turnovers. Obviously that ratio was ridiculous. That's some Golden State s--- right there. ... By us not turning the ball over, it allowed us to set our half-court defense and we looked pretty damn good.""
Ingram and Kuzma continued their strong play of late. Ingram scored 23 points and grabbed six rebounds, and Kuzma had 22 points and five rebounds while battling bigger Pelicans in the paint.
The Lakers trailed by five midway through the third quarter, but then Kuzma started a 10-1 run that saw the forward dunk three times with James throwing down another slam. At one point, the Lakers had three straight dunks that brought the team and the arena to life.
And then it was James who basically clinched the much-needed win for the Lakers with his big 3-pointer on the same night that his best friend, Dwyane Wade, nailed a game-winning fling off the glass at the buzzer to stun the Golden State Warriors in Miami.
""The degree of difficulty, mine was a little bit more difficult than his,"" James said when asked whose shot was tougher. ""His was weird. I don't even know if it was even a shot. It was like, you know how you play pop-a-shot? And he had to because he had no time, but yeah, I think my shot was more difficult.""
On a night when the LA Clippers and Sacramento Kings both lost, the Lakers now are three games back of the Clippers and San Antonio Spurs for the seventh and eighth spots in the Western Conference standings.
On Friday, Ball will be re-evaluated medically to determine his status. On Wednesday, though, the Lakers were glad to see one of their point guards feeling better and more like himself.
""I'm very confident in what Rondo has done in this league,"" Walton said. ""He's struggled a little bit, but some of that is on me. His minutes have been down, too, and we have been trying to find different groups to work.
""But he's proven that over his career that when he gets an opportunity, he shows up to play. ... We brought him in as a championship point guard. We need to start winning games and he's someone I feel totally confident with giving that opportunity to help lead us.""

26174533,"LOS ANGELES -- Lakers point guard Rajon Rondo will not be fined or disciplined for sitting in a courtside seat removed from his teammates late in the Lakers' 115-99 loss Wednesday to the Denver Nuggets, sources told ESPN.
Rondo met with Lakers president Magic Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka on the team's off day Thursday to discuss his seat choice and how it was perceived.
""They notified me that it was a league rule that you can't sit there,"" Rondo told ESPN after the meeting on Thursday. ""I wasn't aware of it. But now I know going forward where I need to be.""
Rondo estimated he sat in a seat separate from the bench ""eight, 10 times this year"" when speaking to reporters after the game.
""I've done it (before),"" he reiterated Thursday. ""I've sat everywhere but the bench more than 40 seconds. But I guess when things aren't going well you can kind of continue to make up stories. But I never thought it was a big deal. I was just in my head contemplating the game. That's kind of what I do. I don't think I have to explain myself as far as my relationship with the team, the players and the coaches. That shouldn't even be discussed.""
Rondo played 16 minutes in the second half against Denver compared to 17 minutes for the Lakers' two-way contract player Alex Caruso. Rondo pushed back on the assumption that his choice of seat had anything to do with being upset over playing time.
""I still don't understand why we're talking about it but we are,"" Rondo said. ""A.C. and those guys did a hell of a job playing. I broke down film for two hours last night. I mean, I don't know what people want. After a loss, I'm still trying to figure it out. But it is what it is. People are going to say what they say.""
Rondo, a 13-year veteran, four-time All-Star and one-time champion as a member of the Boston Celtics, shrugged off any talk of him deserving a fine.
""Everyone has an opinion,"" Rondo said. ""I'm not controlled by money ... I can't control what they say. If somebody wants to fine me, I won't wake up tomorrow upset about it.""
The Lakers are currently in 11th place in the Western Conference, 6.5 games behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the eighth and final playoff spot with 17 games left to play.
""Just continue to be a pro,"" Rondo said of closing out the season. ""I'm a competitive guy. I don't like to lose in cards, Connect 4 or Uno. So, I want to win as many games as possible. This is part of it.
""We're in a situation that nobody thought we'd be in at the beginning of the year. But it is what it is. There's a lot of things to get better at individually and as a team so, I don't think and I believe that we're definitely not going to just lay down the rest of the year. We're going to play guys that want to play, we're going to play the right way and play with pride.""

26242879,"""Kevin did not practice,"" Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said after Tuesday's practice. ""He'll miss [Wednesday]. Just day-to-day, but he's not ready to play tomorrow.""
Durant initially injured the ankle in Sunday night's loss to the Phoenix Suns. With 6:34 left in regulation Durant came down on Suns center Deandre Ayton's foot and turned his ankle. He left the game and did not return.
Warriors officials were not concerned that it would be a lingering issue, but Kerr has said several times in recent weeks that the organization will take a cautious approach with players as the group prepares for what it hopes will be another long playoff run.
For his part, Durant did not seem concerned about the injury. He got some shots up after Tuesday's practice and will be re-evaluated over the next few days.
After Wednesday's game, which begins a four-game road trip, the Warriors don't play again until Saturday night against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

26177169,"Atlanta Hawks forward Vince Carter, 42, said he wants to return for a 22nd NBA season if teams are interested in him this offseason.
When asked during an appearance Thursday on ESPN's Pardon The Interruption if he had an age in mind for when he wanted to retire, Carter said, ""43.""
""I think I could stretch it out one more,"" he said. ""At the end of the year, I usually assess from top to bottom to see how I'm feeling. And, obviously, opportunity -- when the phone call rings and teams show interest, that's a good thing.""
The Hawks are Carter's third team in as many seasons; he played for the Kings in 2017-18 and the Grizzlies for the three seasons before that. Carter agreed to a one-year, $2.4 million deal with the Hawks last July. The eight-time All-Star is averaging 7.1 points per game this season while playing 16.6 minutes per game. He's shooting a career-high 40.9 percent on 3-pointers.
""Me, personally, I think I could give it another year, so why not?"" he told PTI. ""We'll see what happens.""
"
26096101,"""Starts with me,"" he said after the loss to the Grizzlies on Monday dropped the Lakers three games behind the San Antonio Spurs for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. ""I just got to stay positive.""
There was a noticeable shift in the four-time MVP's demeanor in Memphis -- the loss in the previous game to the Pelicans was so dispiriting that teammate Kyle Kuzma openly questioned the consistency of the team's body language, a not-so-veiled reference to James.
The positivity carried back to L.A. on Wednesday, when eight times during his seven-minute media session James repeated his confidence about the Lakers' current position.
""We like where we are,"" he said in his opening answer.
""I like where we are today,"" he continued minutes later.
It was a far cry from the dour outlook he projected after the loss to the Pelicans, when he called out his teammates' lack of experience in making a playoff run and all the commitment that goes into it.
James was asked if the statements he makes to the press are an echo of what he tells his teammates behind closed doors, or if he uses the media to send messages. He sidestepped the question, shifting the conversation back toward how he views the position his team is in.
""It's hard to kind of [determine] what I say to you guys that filters back to my guys,"" James said. ""For those guys, I think we try to prepare every day. And we do prepare. Not try. We prepare every day for our next challenge and we did that today. And I love the positive mindset that we have, even with the struggle that we've had the last 10 games. I like where we are as a ballclub today with our mindset and hopefully going forward.""
Lakers coach Luke Walton said he has tried to manage his team's mindset by steering the players toward what's said to one another in the sanctuary of the locker room, not what's being said in media sessions.
""I encourage a lot of our players not to pay attention to a lot of it,"" Walton said. ""Because a lot of it will get twisted and headlines will read something totally different than what was said. So it's no different than anything else we've been preaching all year from the [get-go], and that's let's worry about our group. We're the ones that are going to make things happen or not, so we can't let outside distractions get in our way.""
Walton was asked about a video that went viral on social media showing James apparently messing up his defensive coverage late in the Memphis loss, leaving the Grizzlies' Bruno Caboclo wide open to hit a 3-pointer that put Memphis up 103-96 with 2:30 remaining.
While explaining what L.A. ideally would have done on that possession, Walton essentially exonerated James even though the optics of the video made it look like James gave no effort on the play.
""They did a nice job,"" Walton said of the Grizzlies, later noting that Mike Conley's dominance down the stretch caused L.A. to scramble its defense a bit. ""But we wanted LeBron to be the rotation man to [Jonas] Valanciunas or [Joakim] Noah, whoever was going to be out there, and him rotate to that big.""
Whether it's rhetoric, trying to flip the proverbial switch or a shared mindset, James and Walton stayed focused on the opportunity to lead the Lakers to their first playoff berth in six years.
""We're fully aware of how difficult this job can be, but we also should be aware of how blessed we are to have these jobs,"" Walton said. ""We come into work and play basketball every day. We should be pretty upbeat about that and excited.""
James, who was reminded by a reporter that the Lakers' longest win streak of the season is only four games, kept pointing to sunny skies ahead.
""We have an opportunity today to make the most of today and not worry about what happened in the past,"" James said. ""We're not worried about what the time strain is or what everyone else is saying. I think it's what happens in here and I feel good about where we are.""

26197466,"The volatile, longstanding dispute between Portland Trail Blazers center Enes Kanter and Turkish government officials has added another chapter, this time in separate interviews conducted by E:60's Jeremy Schaap, with Kanter again comparing Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to a dictator, and former NBA player Hedo Turkoglu, now a Turkish government official, accusing Kanter of abandoning his homeland to support a ""terrorist.""
The on-camera interview with Turkoglu -- now a chief adviser to Erdogan -- is the first with American media about Kanter. Turkoglu, who played with several NBA teams, including the Orlando Magic and San Antonio Spurs, played with Kanter on the 2011 Turkish national team. He is also head of the Turkish Basketball Federation. The interviews aired Sunday morning.
Turkoglu spoke carefully and deliberately to Schaap, saying that Kanter has been ""openly supporting a terrorist leader"" -- Fethullah Gulen. Gulen is a U.S.-based Turkish cleric who has been living in exile from Turkey since 1999; he is Kanter's spiritual adviser and a bitter rival of Erdogan's. The Turkish government has accused Gulen of masterminding a failed military coup in the country in 2016. Gulen has denied the allegation, and the U.S. government has rejected Turkey's requests to extradite him from his home in Pennsylvania.
In the 32-minute E:60 interview, Turkoglu only referenced Kanter by name once and said he had nothing to say to his former teammate: ""I don't send messages to terrorist organization supporters."" In response to a question about how Americans should view the saga between Kanter and Turkish government officials, Turkoglu said: ""All I have to say to all my American fellows, be careful.""
Erdogan and Gulen were once political allies, but after a 2013 corruption scandal reached all the way to Erdogan and his family, Erdogan blamed Gulen for having a role in exposing the scandal, and their relationship fractured. Kanter has been an outspoken critic of the Turkish government and Erdogan since.
Kanter, who has played for the Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder and New York Knicks, frequently has been quoted saying Erdogan is the ""Hitler of our century."" In December 2017, Turkey's state-run news agency, Anadolu Agency, reported that Kanter faces more than four years in prison for insulting Erdogan and Turkoglu in a series of tweets posted in 2016. In May 2017, Kanter's Turkish passport was canceled while traveling overseas. He ultimately was able to return to the United States through London. A few weeks later, Kanter's parents' home was raided, and his father, Mehmet, was taken into custody and charged with being a member of a terrorist group. Enes Kanter believes the Turkish government targeted his father, a genetics professor, because of the player's critical stance against the country's government.
In his E:60 interview, Kanter told Schaap his public pronouncements infuriate Turkish leadership: ""When I talk, or when I tweet something, or when I say anything about the government, it goes everywhere, all over the world, and they hate it. And they know there is no way they can buy me."" He told Schaap that if he returned to Turkey, he'd be killed.
While he says his resolve is strong, he told Schaap that being perceived negatively in Turkey is ""tough.""
""I mean, Turkey is my country. You know, it's my flag. That is where we're raised. ... My family is born there. So that's why, like, it's tough to see that ... your country don't want you. People say, 'Where are you from?' What should I say? 'Turkey?' No. They don't even want me there.""
After the failed coup, Kanter's father sent a letter to a Turkish newspaper, disowning his son due to his vocal support of Gulen, saying Enes had been ""hypnotized"" by the Fethullah Terrorist Organization. He apologized ""to the Turkish people and the president for having such a son.""
Kanter told Schaap he can't remember when he last spoke with his parents. He said he believed his father wrote the letter ""so the government can leave them alone."" But a few months later, his father was dismissed from his university position.
Since the failed coup in July 2016, hundreds of thousands of Turkish residents have lost their jobs and have been subjected to criminal investigations, Amnesty International's Turkish director, Andrew Gardner, told E:60. Tens of thousands of people have been held in pretrial prison detention, including two of his Amnesty International colleagues, for what Gardner described as ""absurd, baseless allegations that they were connected to terrorism. ... This is something that is really being used to target people in civil society, such as journalists, activists and human rights defenders as well.""
Schaap asked Turkoglu about the firings and jailings, and he responded: ""My government [is] just exposing the people who has relationship with Fethullah Gulen organization.""
In his interview, Turkoglu repeatedly referenced Gulen as a terrorist and Kanter's support of him as treasonous. Turkoglu said Kanter uses his NBA stardom as a ""platform for propaganda of [a] terrorist leader."" He said he spoke to E:60 to raise awareness about Turkey's view of Kanter and Gulen. ""So, obviously, it's our job sometimes to speak loudly and clearly to inform everybody about the real situation.""
Gulen's culpability in the coup attempt has been the subject of debate in documentaries and in-depth investigative reports.
Former NBA player Hedo Turkoglu, now an adviser to the president of Turkey, said the Knicks' Enes Kanter's reasons for not traveling to London are visa-related and the center's fears for his life are ""irrational.""
Veteran center Enes Kanter, who was released by the Knicks last week after averaging 14 points and 10.5 rebounds this season, has signed with the Trail Blazers.
Steven Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think-tank, told E:60 that the Turkish government has yet to provide, to the U.S. government, concrete evidence of Gulen's involvement in the coup attempt.
""There really is no direct evidence that Fethullah Gulen himself gave the order,"" Cook says. ""It certainly stands to reason that Gulenist-affiliated, or followers of Gulen within the military, took part in the attempted coup. All of the evidence that has come out in trials in Turkey are suspect, because there are serious allegations that these are confessions that were made under extreme pressure. And there's been no independent investigation in Turkey.""
The U.S. government does not regard Gulen and his supporters as terrorists. But Gulen's presence in the United States hasn't been without controversy. There have been multiple investigations into Gulen-affiliated charter schools over financial and immigration concerns. And Cook told E:60 that the U.S. Department of Justice is ""looking into this network of charter schools in the United States.""
Officials in Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with E:60 at their headquarters in Ankara last month. After the meeting, ESPN followed up with a list of specific questions about both Kanter's and his father's criminal cases. Officials would not provide any court documents involving Kanter or his father, but the government did confirm there is ongoing prosecution of Kanter. No indictment has been issued; Mehmet Kanter was conditionally released in June 2017, and according to Enes Kanter, his father's trial is scheduled for Thursday.
Turkey asked INTERPOL to issue a Red Notice, which is ""a request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition,"" according to INTERPOL. E:60 asked INTERPOL about the request, and the press office replied that agency officials do not comment on specific cases or individuals ""except in special circumstances and with the approval of the member country concerned. We would therefore advise you to contact the Turkish authorities.""
Turkish government officials declined to provide information to E:60 that had been provided to INTERPOL. When asked for specific details, such as the evidence presented to INTERPOL or the crime Kanter has been accused of, Turkish officials did not provide them. But E:60 obtained Turkey's INTERPOL request, and in it, the Turkish government accuses Kanter of helping fund Gulen's movement, which it considers a terrorist organization. If he is apprehended and found guilty, Kanter's sentence could be between seven and 15 years in prison.

26114172,"BOSTON -- Josh Harris may be the owner of the Philadelphia 76ers, but that doesn't preclude him from checking the standings every morning like every other NBA fan. He's well aware that if the season ended today, his Sixers and the Boston Celtics would play each other in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.
Harris also can do the math: His club is 2-9 against Boston over the past three regular seasons, and the Sixers were eliminated by the Celtics in the second round of the playoffs last year.
So how would Harris assess the season if Philadelphia fell to Boston in the opening round in April?
""It would be problematic,"" Harris answered. ""Very problematic. It would not be what we're playing for.
""We'd be unhappy. I'd be unhappy. The city would be unhappy. We're going to work hard to make sure that doesn't happen. We have enough talent on our roster that if we play the way we're capable of playing, we can beat any team in the East.""
Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid will miss Saturday's game against Golden State due to left knee tendinitis.
The Bucks, Raptors, Celtics and 76ers can each make a case for becoming the first team not led by LeBron James to represent the East in the Finals since 2010.
Which young stars are taking over the NBA?
Harris, who participated in a panel entitled ""Creating a Sports Legacy"" at the MIT/Sloan Analytics Conference in Boston on Friday, encouraged his front office to be proactive in fortifying its roster ahead of last month's trade deadline. Philly picked up two key pieces for its stretch run in Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, both of whom will be free agents this summer.
The Sixers could find themselves in luxury tax purgatory if both players command the max salary, which would pay each of them north of $32 million a season, but Harris says he's committed to finding a way to re-sign them.
""We gave up a lot to get Tobias and Jimmy on our team,"" Harris told ESPN. ""We think they're exceptional talents. We're going to try to keep them. We know we are going to have to pay these guys in an appropriate way.
""We get it. It's expensive.""
The Sixers now boast one of the most potent starting 5s in the NBA: Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Butler, Harris and perimeter veteran JJ Redick. It is a dramatic change from Harris' early years with the team when it was mired in a rebuilding project famously dubbed ""The Process."" Philly endured the wrath of basketball purists who condemned its strategy of blatantly tanking to secure coveted lottery picks. The NBA has since revised the way it conducts its lottery to dissuade teams from engaging in their own ""Process.""
While Harris has enjoyed the excitement of his current contending basketball team, he has not forgotten the 10-win season in 2015-16 that drew the ire of the NBA -- and the league office.
""I'm a competitive person, and Philly is a competitive city,"" Harris said. ""They like winners. When we decided to rebuild, we tried to communicate that to the city, but when you are living through it, it's incredibly hard.
""And the reality is, it probably went a little deeper than I expected. These things aren't perfectly predictable. It was incredibly hard. But what got me through it -- and the city was very supportive in this -- was continuing to focus on creating greatness around the Sixers.
""Now the pressure is on to deliver.""
Embiid, the charismatic big man who delights in trolling his fellow NBA peers, has made no secret of the fact that he often confers with Sixers ownership on the direction of the team. Player empowerment continues to be a topic, and Harris said he welcomes the dialogue.
""Joel respects our job,"" Harris said. ""He's our most important player. He's clearly our future -- they're all an important part of the future -- but Joel is exceptional. We generally talk to him about how we are oriented, and what type of players we might be bringing in. We get his advice. In terms of specific conversations, we give him a heads-up. At times, it's not always appropriate because of the other parties involved. You don't want to compromise who we are talking to or put [Embiid] in an awkward position. ""But we're certainly thinking all the time about how to complement his skill set, which is 3 and D wings, people who spread the court. He's a dominant presence defensively and he's dominant in the paint. We need to take the pressure off him so people don't collapse on him.""
Harris acknowledged the top of the Eastern Conference is potent, and that most recognize the defending champion Golden State Warriors as the favorites to win again.
""I think we have enough talent to go very deep in the playoffs,"" Harris said when asked if he felt the Sixers were championship contenders this season. ""I think we have enough talent to win [it all]. We want to make sure at a minimum to advance deeper in the playoffs than we did last year. We've brought a lot of talent here. They haven't been together that long, but we're hopeful we can position them for a deep run. It's exciting. I'm focused, but I'm also nervous.""
The Sixers aren't the only team that has key personnel who will become free agents. The aforementioned Celtics are in flux with Kyrie Irving, their best player, who has sent mixed signals regarding his plans. An early exit in the postseason could also have major ramifications for Boston's future.
Harris acknowledged that trading for players who could walk away without any team compensation is a nerve-wracking exercise.
""The reality is, people like Tobias and Jimmy, there just aren't that many of them,"" he said. ""It's never perfect, but when make a trade for someone who is expiring, there's risk involved, we're hoping we can convince them this is a great place for them.
""Success for us is going to be about winning playoff series. Obviously, we'd like to have a good regular season, too, but we've added and subtracted to win in the playoffs. We won one playoff series last season. We've created more talent on the roster.
""We're holding ourselves accountable.""

26268295,"Utah Jazz owner Gail Miller addressed the crowd before Thursday's game to underscore the team's willingness to enforce the NBA's code of conduct following Monday's incident involving Russell Westbrook and a fan who crossed the line.
Miller spoke for about 3½ minutes before the Jazz faced the Minnesota Timberwolves and asked fans to look out for potential repeats of the shouting match that led Utah to issue fan Shane Keisel a lifetime ban.
""I am extremely disappointed that one of our quote 'fans' conducted himself in such a way as to offend not only a guest in our arena, but also me personally, my family, our organization, the community, our players and you, as the best fans in the NBA,"" Miller said.
""This should never happen. We are not a racist community. We believe in treating people with courtesy and respect as human beings. From time to time, individual fans exhibit poor behavior and forget their manners and disrespect players on other teams. When that happens, I want you to jump up and shout 'stop.' We have a code of conduct in this arena. It will be strictly enforced.""
Video of Westbrook saying, ""I'll f--- you up"" to Keisel while standing near the end of the Thunder bench during the second quarter went viral after being posted on Twitter. Westbrook said after the game that it was an emotional reaction to Keisel telling him, ""Get on your knees like you're used to,"" a comment Westbrook considered ""completely disrespectful"" and ""racial.""
The Jazz permanently banned the fan from their games, and the NBA fined Westbrook $25,000.
""Other teams are not our enemies. They are our competition,"" Miller said. ""Competition is a good thing. It allows players to showcase their talents, and it allows fans to encourage, appreciate, cheer for and enjoy those who share their talents with us.""
Earlier in the day, Miller sent an email to fans on the team's mailing list with instructions to send a text message to the arena if they should see anyone violating the conduct code.
""We do not permit hate speech, racism, sexism or homophobia,"" the email said. ""We also do not allow disruptive behavior, including bullying, foul or abusive language, or obscene gestures. Violators may be subject to ejection and other penalties, including a lifetime ban.""
Another email to season-ticket holders said the team can revoke those tickets regardless of who is sitting in those seats for a particular game.

26259468,"OKLAHOMA CITY -- Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook declined to share any thoughts Wednesday about the Utah Jazz issuing a lifetime ban to fan Shane Keisel for the incident that occurred during Monday night's game.
""If you want to talk about tonight's game, we can do it,"" Westbrook said when asked his reaction. ""If not, enjoy your night.""
Westbrook was fined $25,000 by the NBA for ""directing profanity and threatening language to a fan.""
The Thunder did not practice Tuesday, and did not hold a morning shootaround Wednesday. In the locker room before Wednesday's game against the Brooklyn Nets was the first time Westbrook had officially been available, but he declined to talk. (By rule, Westbrook is required to be available at least once on game day before tipoff, whether at shootaround or in the locker room pregame.)
Thunder coach Billy Donovan called the incident an ""unfortunate situation"" and credited the Jazz for how quickly they responded with the ban.
""It sheds to light sometimes these things that players have to deal with during the course of games,"" Donovan said. ""It's unfortunate because I think a lot of people do come to the games as fans and want to root and cheer their team on, but those situations are really unfortunate. If anything, it brings light to something the league, along with players -- everybody can try to make it better.""
Westbrook was sensational in the Thunder's 108-96 victory over the Nets, recording his 26th triple-double of the season with 31 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists. After one particularly thrilling sequence late in the fourth quarter that ended with Westbrook drilling a dagger 3 to put the Thunder up 13, he danced and shimmied at half court as the Nets called timeout.
""I'm extremely blessed man, humbled, to go out and hoop,"" Westbrook said when asked if playing Wednesday was helpful in moving on from the recent situation. ""And that's that.""

26154330,"The Milwaukee Bucks are the NBA's first team to win 50 games this season, the Houston Rockets are still streaking and the Boston Celtics are looking like Eastern Conference contenders again amid a successful West Coast trip. The Los Angeles Lakers, on the other hand? The losses continue to pile up as LeBron James & Co. find themselves closing in on a lottery pick.
Throughout the regular season, our panel (ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz, Tim MacMahon and Andre' Snellings, The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears and FiveThirtyEight's Chris Herring) ranks all 30 teams from top to bottom, taking stock of which are playing the best basketball and which are looking most like title contenders.
Previous rankings: Week 21 | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | Training camp | Free agency
1. Milwaukee Bucks
Record: 50-17
Milwaukee picked up its 50th win of the season on Friday, just the second time in three decades the franchise has reached that mark in a campaign. So just how good is this team? Here's some context: As NBA.com's Micah Adams points out, Milwaukee's point differential against teams .500 or better ranks fifth-best over the past 25 seasons. The four teams with a better margin over that span: The 72-win Bulls in 1995-96, the 73-win Warriors from 2015-16, and the 2016-17 and 2017-18 Golden State clubs that won titles. -- Herring
2. Golden State Warriors
Record: 45-21
Warriors All-Stars Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry combined to miss 22 3-pointers in a stunning loss against Phoenix on Sunday. That's the most missed combined 3s in any game by The Splash Brothers, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. Curry and Thompson combined to attempt 30 3-pointers, tied for their most combined such attempts in a regular-season game. -- Spears
3. Toronto Raptors
Record: 48-19
Pascal Siakam has all but locked up the Most Improved Player Award. He has more than doubled his scoring output per game (7.3 to 16.4), while upping his true shooting percentage from 54.9 to 64.6. Yet more than statistically, Siakam has given the Raptors a scorer, playmaker and defender they can rely on unreservedly to make big decisions in big spots. -- Arnovitz
4. Houston Rockets
Record: 41-25
""It feels good to win on the defensive end,"" James Harden said after the Rockets extended the longest active winning streak in the league to eight games with a 94-93 victory over the Mavericks. It was a hideous offensive performance for Houston, but the Rockets never worry about their ability to score. They've made major progress on the other end since Clint Capela returned, ranking sixth in defensive rating (106.2) since the All-Star break. -- MacMahon
5. Denver Nuggets
Record: 43-22
The Nuggets entered Friday night with a chance to catch the Warriors for the top seed in the Western Conference, but were blown out in a statement win by Golden State. The Nuggets have lost four of their past five games and now must contend with a surging Rockets squad that has leaped to the third seed and is only a few games behind the Nuggets with a month left in the season. -- Snellings
6. Portland Trail Blazers
Record: 40-26
The Blazers are 25-9 at home and 15-17 on the road this season (Portland averages 117.1 points per game at home but 110.4 on the road, the third highest PPG drop in the league). That leaves the Blazers with seven home games and nine road games as they fight with Houston and Oklahoma City for the third and fourth seeds in the Western Conference playoffs. The Blazers still have a mixed bag left of road games against the Clippers, Pelicans, Spurs, Bulls, Hawks, Pistons, Timberwolves, Nuggets and Lakers. -- Spears
7. Philadelphia 76ers
Record: 42-25
With Joel Embiid back in action on Sunday for the first time since the All-Star break, the Sixers restored order with a big win over a Pacers team directly above them in the standings. Embiid scored 33 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in 28 minutes, with the Sixers' starters looking like a formidable unit. -- Arnovitz
8. Oklahoma City Thunder
Record: 40-26
The Thunder have lost six of their past eight games to slide to a tie with the Blazers for the fourth seed in the West. The good news is that they are still within a game of the Rockets for the third seed and Paul George is back and healthy, but the bad news is that their next seven games are against playoff teams, starting Monday in Salt Lake City. -- Snellings
9. Boston Celtics
Record: 41-26
The Celtics have used their West Coast road trip to right the ship, starting with a huge win in Golden State and building a three-game California win streak going into Monday's game with the Clippers. Gordon Hayward continues to be the best bellwether for the Celtics' results, as the team has won 15 of the past 16 games in which Hayward has scored double figures. -- Snellings
10. San Antonio Spurs
Record: 38-29
The Spurs' roller-coaster season continued with a five-game winning streak on the heels of a 1-7 rodeo trip. That matches San Antonio's longest winning streak of the season. LaMarcus Aldridge (26.8 points, 55.6 field goal percentage) and DeMar DeRozan (20.2 points, 52.4 field goal percentage) have both been in great grooves during the Spurs' run. -- MacMahon
11. Utah Jazz
Record: 37-28
What a disappointing week for the Jazz. Coming off wins over the Nuggets and Bucks, Utah had positioned itself to make a run at the West's No. 3 seed. That took a serious hit when the Jazz blew a double-digit fourth-quarter lead at home against the Pelicans and lost on the road to the Grizzlies. -- MacMahon
12. LA Clippers
Record: 38-29
Lost amid the revolving door to the Clippers' locker room is Danilo Gallinari, who has quietly assembled the best season of his 11-year tenure in the NBA. He's posting career-best numbers in true shooting percentage (62.5), player efficiency rating (20.0), and win shares per 48 minutes. He also has been more durable than he's been in quite some time, missing only 11 games this season. -- Arnovitz
13. Indiana Pacers
Record: 42-25
Indiana has basically traded off wins and losses over its past 10 games or so. But the more concerning thing, as the team readies for the playoffs, is that the Pacers haven't beaten a team in playoff position in more than a month, dating back to a victory over the Clippers in early February. That has been their story this season, as the Pacers have more wins against sub-.500 teams than anyone in the East, but are far worse against the upper-echelon clubs than the other top contenders in the conference. -- Herring
14. Detroit Pistons
Record: 34-31
Detroit has been the hottest team in the East, winning 12 of its past 14 games. The Pistons have worked themselves all the way up to sixth place (and a 99 percent playoff probability in FiveThirtyEight's NBA projection model), which, depending on how the top of the conference shakes out, could be ideal positioning for them. You have to imagine the Pistons would feel best about their chances of advancing to the second round if they drew a first-round matchup with the Pacers, should Indy win the battle for the No. 3 seed. -- Herring
15. Brooklyn Nets
Record: 35-33
It has been an inspiring season in the 718, but the Nets are about to embark on one of the most brutal 14-game stretches we've ever seen to conclude a season. With the exception of a road date against the Lakers, every Nets opponent is currently seeded for the playoffs except scrappy Sacramento, which sits just outside. The slate includes a pair of tussles against Milwaukee, and away games at OKC, Utah, the Clippers, Portland, Philadelphia and Indiana. -- Arnovitz
16. Sacramento Kings
Record: 33-32
The Kings desperately need to get hot if they hope to make the playoffs for the first time since 2006. Sacramento is 5-6 since acquiring Harrison Barnes and Alec Burks in trades. The timing also couldn't have been worse to lose Marvin Bagley III to a knee injury on Feb. 27 after he had the best month of his young career. -- Spears
17. Orlando Magic
Record: 31-37
The Magic had a pedestrian week while the four teams ahead of them in the Eastern Conference standings went a combined 13-1. This has caused the Magic to slide back into the ninth seed in the East, but the Magic have a good chance to go on a run as they next face five straight lottery teams. -- Snellings
18. Miami Heat
Record: 31-35
The Heat had a strong week to reclaim the eighth playoff spot in the East. They are set up for a tight race with the Orlando Magic and Charlotte Hornets for that spot, but the Heat have a tough upcoming schedule with six straight games against teams battling for playoff positioning. The good news is that Goran Dragic has returned from his calf injury and is once again giving the team good minutes at point guard. -- Snellings
19. Minnesota Timberwolves
Record: 32-35
ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Sunday that there is optimism about the MRI results on Karl-Anthony Towns' right knee after he injured it a day earlier versus Washington. Towns is averaging 24.5 points, 12.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists. With Minnesota six games out of the playoff race, is it worth bringing Towns back this season if healthy? -- Spears
20. Los Angeles Lakers
Record: 30-36
A frightening and frustrating development for Brandon Ingram: After putting together one of his most impressive and efficient stretches of games of his young career, the 21-year-old wing has been diagnosed with blood clotting in his right arm and will miss the remainder of the season. The Lakers now play five games in eight days on the road, where they've won only a single game since the start of February. -- Arnovitz
21. Charlotte Hornets
Record: 30-36
The Hornets are in a fight for the last playoff spots in the East with fellow Southeast Division members Miami and Orlando. Charlotte visits Miami next Sunday and plays their regular-season finale against Orlando. The Hornets haven't been to the playoffs since 2015. -- Spears
22. New Orleans Pelicans
Record: 30-39
Jrue Holiday's abdominal strain was another punch to the gut for the Pelicans. He will be re-evaluated next week, but there's no reason to rush back the star guard who has basically replaced Anthony Davis as the face of the franchise. Holiday is good enough to give the Pelicans a chance to win, and that's really not in the franchise's best interest right now. -- MacMahon
23. Memphis Grizzlies
Record: 28-40
Mike Conley must really want the Grizzlies to get rid of the top-eight-protected pick they owe the Celtics. The lone remaining member of the Core Four carried Memphis to a 3-0 mark last week. Conley averaged 31.3 points (15.3 just in fourth quarters) and 7.7 assists on 57.4 percent shooting in wins over the Trail Blazers, Jazz and Magic. -- MacMahon
24. Washington Wizards
Record: 27-39
Trevor Ariza matched his season-high Saturday with a 27-point showing in an overtime loss to Minnesota. But much like the Wizards this season, Ariza's performances have been somewhat uneven since the All-Star break, alternating between high-scoring outputs and single-digit ones -- the opposite of the consistent reputation he has garnered over his career. -- Herring
25. Dallas Mavericks
Record: 27-39
Dallas has dropped 10 of its past 11 games, drastically improving the Mavs' odds to keep their first-round pick, which will go to the Hawks if it lands outside of the top five. At the moment, the Mavs would have 34.5 percent odds to land in the top four. But the losing might be taking a toll on Luka Doncic, who sat on the bench with his head down for a little while after Jalen Brunson's last-second shot was blocked to seal Sunday's loss to Houston. -- MacMahon
26. Chicago Bulls
Record: 19-49
The ending in Chicago's bizarre, last-second victory over the Sixers on Wednesday was noteworthy for all sorts of reasons. Players had to come back on the floor after the game had seemingly ended, and Otto Porter Jr. didn't participate in the do-over, as he was already in the midst of taking a postgame drug test. But the game-winning shot -- Zach LaVine's layup -- was indicative of something that has held true all season: LaVine is getting to the basket at will. A career-high 40 percent of his shots have come from within 3 feet of the basket this season. -- Herring
27. Phoenix Suns
Record: 16-52
The Suns are now 5-4 when Kelly Oubre Jr. starts. Oubre averages 18.9 points and six rebounds as a starter with Phoenix. Oubre will be a restricted free agent this offseason. -- Spears
28. Atlanta Hawks
Record: 23-45
No player in the league this season has initiated more pick-and-roll opportunities than Trae Young, and he's leading by a healthy margin. The Hawks scored only 0.87 points per direct pick for Young in 2018, but 1.05 points per direct pick since Jan. 1. On Friday, Young notched his first triple-double of his career in the Hawks' loss to the Nets. -- Arnovitz
29. Cleveland Cavaliers
Record: 16-50
Guard Collin Sexton broke Kyrie Irving's franchise record for triples during a rookie season this past week, highlighting that he has actually been an above-average shooter (38.8 percent) from the perimeter amid his struggles. The next step in his maturation needs to come on defense in screen-and-roll scenarios. And next season he'll seek to improve on his assist-to-turnover rate, which is only slightly better than 1-to-1. -- Herring
30. New York Knicks
Record: 13-54
The Knicks have maintained a 5.5-game ""lead"" over the Chicago Bulls in the race for a bottom-three seed and an equal share of the best odds in the NBA lottery. Importantly, they have also surpassed the Suns for the worst record in the league, which would guarantee them no worse than the fourth pick in the draft. -- Snellings

26137616,"MIAMI -- Dwyane Wade now has more blocked shots than any guard in NBA history.
The Miami Heat star swatted away the 1,052nd shot of his career Monday night, blocking an attempt by Atlanta's B.J. Johnson. When factoring in regular-season and playoff games, that's one more block than Michael Jordan had in his career.
Kevin Huerter never expected to be counted among the great players who have swapped jerseys with Dwyane Wade during his ""One Last Dance"" season, but Wade shocked the Hawks' rookie with the gesture after their game Monday night.
Jordan still has the all-time regular-season record for blocks by a guard with 893. Wade's two first-half blocks against the Hawks gave him 877.
""Either way, it's pretty cool,"" Wade said after the game.
Johnson became the 449th player to get a shot blocked by Wade. Joe Johnson and Ben Gordon have been blocked by Wade the most, 12 times each.

26203408,"LOS ANGELES -- After the Oklahoma City Thunder's Paul George, Russell Westbrook and Steven Adams fouled out in the final four minutes of a 118-110 loss to the LA Clippers on Friday night at Staples Center, George ripped the officiating in the NBA and said something must be done.
""It's just bad officiating,"" George said. ""I'm sorry, just bad officiating. We don't get a fair whistle. We haven't gotten a fair whistle all year. ... Somebody's got to look into this. It's getting out of hand, where we somehow just walk teams to the line. And there's nobody that gets more contact. If I don't speak for myself, I speak for Russ. There's nobody that gets more contact than Russ going to the basket. And it's just crazy.
""I don't understand it. It's a piece of s--- being on that floor. We giving everything we got. We're playing hard. We're getting grabbed. We're getting scratched, clawed, held, shoved. And there's nothing for it. The officials just get to walk out, and there's nothing that penalizes them for not officiating the game the right way.""
Monty McCutchen, the NBA's VP of officiating, indicated in an appearance on ESPN's The Jump that officials missed a key call at the end of regulation of the Thunder's OT win over the Blazers on Thursday night.
Friday's game marked only the second time in the past 10 seasons that a team had three starters foul out in regulation, according to ESPN Stats & Information. The other time was Feb. 12, 2014, when three Washington Wizards players fouled out.
George said he hasn't seen a game in which two teammates who made the All-Star Game in the same season fouled out in regulation. This was only the third time it has happened in the last 20 seasons according to Elias Sports Bureau: Phoenix's Shawn Marion and Amar'e Stoudemire fouled out in regulation on Feb. 9, 2007 and the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant also fouled out on Dec. 16, 1999.
George had to watch the last 3:49 from the bench after he was whistled for an offensive foul on Patrick Beverley, who celebrated with a scream before jawing with George and the Thunder bench. Then with the Clippers up by three, Westbrook was called for a charge on a drive and fouled out with 54.2 seconds left as the Clippers held on for their fourth consecutive win. Adams collected his sixth foul with 9.2 seconds left.
The Clippers went to the line 46 times compared with the Thunder's 26 trips. The night before, Oklahoma City watched Portland go to the free throw line 47 times, 15 more foul shots than the Thunder got in their 129-121 overtime road win.
""It's nothing we can do,"" said George, who was held to 15 points and six rebounds. ""I'm going to lose money on this. We speak up, we lose money. There's nothing I can do to change that. It is what it is. There's gotta be a change, but there's nothing that I can do.""
Thunder coach Billy Donovan said his team has to curb its fouling, particularly unnecessary fouls far from the basket. The Clippers' Danilo Gallinari (34 points) and Lou Williams (40 points) each went to the foul line 15 times.
""Too much fouling,"" Donovan said when asked about the Thunder's past two opponents going to the line a combined 93 times. ""Our guys are playing hard and competing, but like there is no reason for Lou Williams to get to the free throw line 20 times. We've got to know that. And like our guys are playing really hard and are really competing, but we are fouling too much away from the ball when we don't have to.""
Westbrook said the way some players are playing the game these days leads to a lot of whistles.
""To play without fouling is tough sometimes,"" said Westbrook, who had 32 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists. ""A lot of those guys like play to get fouled. That is how the game is nowadays. It's not really basketball. You're just playing to get fouled to see what happens.""
George said he isn't the only one who feels this way about NBA officiating.
""I come out here and I do my job, and that's to play and be a professional,"" George said. ""I don't know if it's Adam Silver that's got to [look into] this. We expect the officiating to be professional as well.
""It's just got to be called right. When we step on that floor, we got to feel like we are going to get a fair shot, a fair chance. That is what the change [in officiating] needs to be at.""

26146668,"Magic coach Steve Clifford said Monday that Fultz probably won't finish rehabbing his injured shoulder in time to suit up this season.
""He's still rehabbing his shoulder and he's not even able to really do much on the floor yet,"" Clifford told SiriusXM Radio. ""It's a pretty significant shoulder injury.
""I would say he's starting to do a little bit, but it would be very difficult for him to get back this year.""
Fultz was traded from Philadelphia to Orlando on Feb. 7. After being taken with the No. 1 pick in 2018, he played in just 33 games with the Sixers, averaging 7.7 points, 3.4 rebounds and 3.4 assists. He has spent most of his time since the trade in Los Angeles working with his physical therapist.
The Magic were in Philadelphia on Tuesday night to play the Sixers, and before the game 76ers coach Brett Brown said he will be rooting for Fultz.
""First and foremost, elite person, really just a good human being,'' Brown said of Fultz. ""Two, a point guard. Thinks like a point guard, speaks like a point guard and he's a point guard by nature. And he has an instinct from a playing perspective to share and he reads the game well.
""Those two things first come to my mind -- good people and a point guard,'' Brown added. ""We're always thinking about Markelle and we truly wish him well.

26194041,"Los Angeles Lakers coach Luke Walton said Friday it's possible Lonzo Ball will miss the remainder of the season as he deals with a bone bruise related to a Grade 3 ankle sprain he suffered Jan. 19.
Walton says Ball is not close to a return and hasn't done anything outside of dribbling drills and standstill shooting since suffering the injury.
Ball will be re-evaluated Saturday by doctors, the Lakers said.
The Lakers, who have lost four in a row as their playoff hopes disappear, will monitor LeBron James' minutes going forward, with a loose cap of 32 minutes.
Walton said he has not spoken to Ball about sitting out the remainder of the regular season, but the coach is contemplating not having the former No. 2 pick out of UCLA back in the lineup.
""Lonzo hasn't had himself an offseason yet, as far as development, which is a huge part of when you get better at this level,"" Walton said, referring to Ball being sidelined in the summer of 2018 following knee surgery. ""And where we're at now, and not looking like he's close to being able to play yet, then, it's almost getting to the point where the true value comes from, 'Let's get him as healthy as possible so he has however many months this summer to really expand and keep working on his game.'""
Should Ball progress in his rehabilitation, Walton wouldn't even predict a potential return date for him.
""We won't even have the conversation until we've had a week's worth of practice with him and whatnot. So like I said, he's not close to that,"" Walton reiterated. ""What you guys see right now is the most he's been doing on the court.""
Ball injured his ankle at Houston, and the initial timetable for his recovery given by the team was four to six weeks.
In his second season, Ball has averaged 9.9 points 5.4 assists and 5.3 rebounds in 47 games for the Lakers (30-35).

26097803,"Taking the escalator down behind Section 107 at Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, a rider will come face to face with a 30-foot portrait of Anthony Davis, starting at eye level with the Pelicans star's arched brow at the top, before lining up with his scruffy beard when the escalator ends at street level.
It will be art installations such as this, as well as merchandise in the team shop and digital images on the team's website that the Pelicans will be tasked with scrubbing -- much the way they already removed Davis from their intro video -- whenever they move on from the six-time All-Star.
It will be a tedious task, but a basic one at the same time. The Pelicans will only have to erase the tangible.
The Los Angeles Lakers, the team so ready to risk it all for The Brow that they reportedly offered half the roster as well as a couple first-round draft picks to try to acquire him, are left trying to erase the hurt that pursuit caused their locker room.
It's not as easy as tearing down a poster and restocking some shelves.
And especially not easy when all those feelings can get dredged up again on a night like Wednesday when the Lakers beat Davis' Pelicans 125-119 in Los Angeles.

A couple days after the trade deadline, Lakers president Magic Johnson flew to Philadelphia to meet the team and delivered a message to the media that was part Jimmy Dugan in ""A League of Their Own,"" part echoing the old cliché that the NBA really stands for No Boys Allowed.
""Quit making this about thinking these guys are babies because that's what you're treating them like,"" Johnson said. ""They're professionals. All of them. And this is how this league works. They know it, I know it -- that's how it goes.""
In the visitors locker room in New Orleans on Saturday, before the Lakers lost to the Pelicans by 13 with Davis sitting on the sideline in a T-shirt and blazer, Kyle Kuzma -- at least outwardly -- was portraying the steely-minded pro that Johnson described.
He was asked: Does everything surrounding this game -- considering the Lakers have been connected to the Pelicans for months -- enter into your thought process at all?
""Nope,"" Kuzma said.
None whatsoever? Do people hit you up, friends and family, asking about it?
""Nope. It's been long gone.""
Any thoughts on Davis not playing?
""Nah, I mean, they got their own situation. That's how they're handling it. I don't really know about it so I can't really talk about it.""
Others will do the talking. Wondering if the Lakers sabotaged their season by chasing Davis so publicly. ... Falling into one of several criticism camps either aimed at LeBron James for not holding up his end of the bargain, or at the Lakers' young core for not growing up quickly enough, or at Lakers management for not building the team properly, or at Luke Walton for not coaching them up well enough.

Add it all up and just halfway through the first year of LeBron's four-year commitment to L.A., the franchise finds itself at a crossroads that could determine how the entire James era in Laker Land plays out.
All they can do to make things better in the short term is win like they did Wednesday with Davis in the building. Could it have been awkward for the Lakers' core to wonder if the fans in the stands at Staples Center saw Davis put up 22 points on 10-for-14 shooting with 8 rebounds in 21 minutes and wanted him more than they want them?
If it was a so-called ""distraction,"" as so many seem keen to label it, you wouldn't know it by the way Kuzma attacked the rim in the third quarter to get L.A. back into it after the Pelicans threatened to knock the Lakers out.
""We talk about [the negative speculation] and it might be a reality [of being in L.A.], but we can't let that be our truth,"" Walton said Wednesday. ""We have to make that decision to not let those things get in the way of what we want to accomplish.""
Kyle Kuzma disrespects his former teammate, Julius Randle, with a vicious jam.
Everybody should be motivated to make the postseason, overcoming a three-game gap over the final 21 games, for their own reasons.
James can say, ""It's nothing I need to get in this league that I don't already have. Everything else for me is just like icing on the cake,"" like he did in Boston earlier this month, but going from eight straight NBA Finals appearances to missing the playoffs would unquestionably be a bad look for his legacy.
For Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart, making the playoffs would be another step in their professional development and the thrill of their young careers. Plus, with the entire league watching the Lakers' season unfold, this stretch will disproportionately define how other teams will view their talents -- for better or for worse.
For Magic and general manager Rob Pelinka, it would be another receipt they could add to the pile they hand to Jeanie Buss when it comes to evaluating their performance: Since we took over we got out from under some bad contracts, landed LeBron and made the playoffs. How do you like me now?
Despite his dour outlook after losses to the Pelicans and Grizzlies, LeBron James took a more positive outlook in L.A. on Wednesday, saying of the Lakers, ""I like where we are today.""
As the Lakers and Celtics continue to struggle, another team has faced adversity and persevered.
Here's what the teams still in the Anthony Davis sweepstakes can offer in the offseason.
For Walton, it would be proof he just might be the right guy to continue to play ringmaster of this circus.
And Davis could still end up in L.A. But he'll have no direct impact on this playoff push. Maybe the young guys look so good down the stretch that the Lakers decide they would be better off waiting for Davis to reach free agency in 2020 than reigniting trade talks with the Pelicans in the offseason.
Or maybe they look so good that the Pelicans change their mind about wanting them and they are ultimately traded for Davis in July. That's the business. Playing any less than they're capable of to avoid such a scenario will only hurt their earning potential in the long run.
Or maybe Boston trades for Davis and Kyrie Irving re-ups with the Celtics and all the Davis-to-L.A. talk dies for good.
There are a lot of unknowns.
What's certain is anyone involved with the Lakers paying any more mind to Davis for the next six weeks is a waste of time.
Time to avoid the escalator, take the stairs and see where it takes them.

26136415,"The Golden State Warriors expect to sign their former center Andrew Bogut soon, a source told ESPN, although there are formalities that have to be completed before a contract can be signed.
Bogut has to obtain a work visa and get clearance from FIBA before he can sign a contract for the remainder of the season. Bogut completed his season with the Sydney Kings of Australia's National Basketball League on Sunday. A source said Bogut is expected to get FIBA clearance this week, but the work visa could take seven to 10 days to arrive.
A source said Warriors assistant general manager Larry Harris, who drafted Bogut first overall as general manager of the Bucks in 2005, recently went to Australia to visit Bogut and watch him play.
Andrew Gaze says Andrew Bogut's return to the NBA was always going to happen and he is just grateful the star centre gave the Kings his all.
Warriors star Kevin Durant expressed confidence Monday that Kyrie Irving and the Celtics will get things rolling again soon.
Bogut, 34, first joined the Warriors for the 2012-13 season and started 230 regular-season games over a four-year span. He was a member of Golden State's 2015 championship team.
Coach Steve Kerr said Monday the Warriors have been talking with Bogut about bringing him back to the team, but noted that the deal is still not done.
""I'm not going to go into kind of our needs and all that,"" Kerr said after Monday's practice. ""Just cut right to the chase and tell you that we have been talking to Bogut and his representatives and nothing is official. And there's things that have to happen and we can't really comment on it until it's official. The other question [about how he fits] I'll answer at the appropriate time.""
Warriors star Kevin Durant noted that he has confidence in whomever the Warriors' front office decides to bring in to fill the final roster spot.
""We trust whoever they bring in as long as he do his job,"" Durant said. ""I'm sure [Bogut's] going to add a little bit of knowledge and wisdom because he's been a part of the system before. We're looking forward to having him on the team.""

26056184,"Editor's note: This piece has been updated since it originally posted on Feb. 23.
Wednesday night marks the 18th time the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets have squared off since 2016-17, and looking back at the data from those games provides a fascinating glimpse into one of the NBA's most high-profile matchups: James Harden vs. the Warriors' defense.
The Rockets love to isolate Harden, but when they play Golden State, it's more accurate to say that they love to isolate him against Stephen Curry. Over the past three seasons, nobody has switched onto Harden as much as Curry, and that's no accident.
Aside from splashing all those 3s, the defining trait of the Warriors dynasty might be the tendency to switch defensive assignments. The Rockets try to exploit that tendency by hunting and isolating mismatches more than any other rival.
Look at the switching data from last season's epic seven-game series in the Western Conference finals. It's clear which defender Harden and the Rockets were targeting:
Curry switched onto Harden as many times as the next five Warriors combined. Why? Because it works. The numbers are staggering.
Dating back to the 2016-17 season, more than 5,000 unique NBA player duos have matched up at least 100 times. But within that massive sample, Harden vs. Curry produces the most extreme stats.
Lest you think I'm exaggerating, consider these four factoids, via Second Spectrum tracking:
No other matchup elicits a higher usage rate by the offensive player
No other matchup is more likely to include a drive
Only three other matchups produce free throws at a higher rate
Only six other matchups yield more points for the offensive player
Out of more than 5,000.
James Harden drives into the lane and schools Steph Curry with a nasty step-back jumper, cutting the Warriors' lead to 93-83.
Harden vs. Curry is the wildest analytical matchup in the NBA, especially when you consider the stakes involved. After all, these are two MVPs and scoring champs battling for Western supremacy.
When you compare Harden's key matchup numbers with other Golden State defenders, you quickly understand why Houston designs sets to target Curry:
Harden is much more aggressive and much more fruitful against Curry than against any other Warriors player. His usage rate surges to 50.7 -- right around the average for an NBA Jam game, but a cartoonish number for any real-life environment.
With Curry on him, Harden is more than twice as likely to drive the ball to the hoop and get to the free throw line.
💪 drive for @JHarden13! Warriors 83 #Rockets 73 ⏰ 8:27 pic.twitter.com/3i5rgztgzL
The other guys in that table are either strong enough or long enough to dissuade Harden's aggression, but Curry is slight and short compared to his teammates, and he is much less able to slow Harden's rim attacks.
While it's tempting to interpret these data as indictments of Curry's defense, there's something else happening here. It just so happens that all of the other defenders in that table are world-class, and Houston's tendency to isolate and attack Curry at freakish rates says just as much about its respect for those other dudes as it does about Curry. Isolating Curry isn't Houston's best choice, it's really the Rockets' only chance.Editor's PicksLowe: LeBron vs. MJ, this Lakers season and a great NBA what-ifLeBron is headed to the lottery in his first season out West. That means something ... but what?
LeBron is headed to the lottery in his first season out West. That means something ... but what?
Watching the Rockets these days is an exercise in repetition. They love to isolate Harden over and over and over. But against Golden State, that bread-and-butter tactic really makes sense only against Curry or the Warriors' slower bigs such as Kevon Looney. Plus, when Curry is defending Harden, that means dudes such as Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson are busy stifling Houston's secondary scorers, further establishing Harden vs. Curry as the best option available.
More than any other defender he faces in the NBA, Harden sees Curry as a pathway to points. Even though Harden averages 48 points per 100 possessions, that number fluctuates a ton depending on the defender, according to Second Spectrum data. Thompson holds Harden to 20 fewer points when he is the primary defender. But against Curry, Harden surges. In the 2018 playoffs, Harden poured in 58 points per 100 possessions against Curry, and a disproportionate amount of those points came from the free throw line.
No wonder the Rockets iso Harden on Steph so much... https://t.co/tirhzeQAi5 pic.twitter.com/ArV9wFCqbM
Over the past three seasons, Harden has matched up against 42 individual players at least 100 times, but none results in free throws as frequently as the Curry showdown, per Second Spectrum. Of that group of Harden defenders, Iguodala has done the best work against The Beard, holding him to 17.2 points per 100 possessions on a 21.0 effective field goal percentage. Those are atrocious numbers for Harden, but they serve as another reminder that Iguodala is one of Golden State's most powerful defensive weapons come playoff time.
Still, while the numbers leave little doubt that Harden dominates his individual matchups against Curry, basketball remains a team game. Curry seems more than content to win the wars -- and the titles.
