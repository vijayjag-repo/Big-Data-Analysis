Who wins this deal? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
After a flurry of trades, which teams are looking worse and which ones got stronger?
The Rockets are acquiring guard Iman Shumpert, whom they expect to play a significant bench role in their playoff push, in a three-way deal with the Cavaliers and Kings.
Philadelphia will become the sixth club for the well-traveled Ennis, who averaged 7.4 points for the Rockets this season.
Ennis has also played for Miami, New Orleans, Memphis and Detroit. He's a career 36 percent shooter from 3-point range and will add to Philadelphia's bench depth.
The Rockets, who will create a $1.6 million trade exception with the deal, are inching their way closer to getting under the luxury tax. The Rockets save $2.4 million with the trade and are now $2.4 million above the tax threshold.
Houston started the season with a tax bill of $14.6 million.

25931922,"Los Angeles Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson wants the New Orleans Pelicans to start offering counter proposals to offers on All-Star Anthony Davis, threatening to end talks unless the Pelicans show a willingness to engage in a back-and-forth on reaching a deal, league sources told ESPN on Tuesday.
The Lakers on Monday night added two more young players -- Josh Hart and Ivica Zubac -- to a trade package that already included Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and two first-round picks, sources said.
Johnson and Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka felt like they were beginning to bid against themselves in the process, but insist they'll add nothing more to a deal without Pelicans GM Dell Demps showing an increased engagement with the Lakers, league sources said.
The NBA's trade deadline is Thursday at 3 p.m. ET. New Orleans has listed Davis as questionable for Wednesday's game against the Chicago Bulls.
Anthony Davis is a superstar, but the Lakers have reasons to stop short of a blockbuster trade.
The Pelicans are engaging with the Lakers in talks on a trade for Anthony Davis, but president Magic Johnson must overcome significant support within the Pelicans organization to let Thursday's deadline expire with Davis remaining on the roster.
Our experts give six deals that work, including 10 teams and multiple contenders.
The Pelicans haven't countered the Lakers' offers but do have expectations that Johnson will overwhelm them with young players and a historic haul of draft picks. To New Orleans, that means four first-round and second-round picks as part of a trade package, league sources told ESPN.
The Pelicans want to be compensated -- perhaps even overcompensated -- for bypassing the chance to open up the process in the offseason and delivering Davis to the Lakers now.
The Lakers are fighting both the clock on Thursday's trade deadline and the Pelicans' ability to hold onto Davis into the offseason, when there could be several new scenarios available to them.
Davis' agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, seems to have made some inroads into tightening the trade market on the Pelicans, limiting what some rivals might be willing to offer based on the fear of losing Davis as a rental in 2020 free agency. Paul has worked to keep the process moving toward a perception of inevitability on Davis' preferred future destination, the Lakers, where he could join another Klutch client, LeBron James.
The Pelicans did learn Monday of a new, extended list of teams that Davis is willing to stay with long term upon being traded, including the Milwaukee Bucks and LA Clippers, league sources said. Those two teams have yet to make offers for Davis and likely don't have the assets to make a deal happen, league sources said.
While Paul is providing the Pelicans with clear options beyond the Lakers, questions still remain about those teams' ability to make compelling offers to the Pelicans.The New York Knicks were also on that extended list, but they were rejected in their offer of a package centered on Kristaps Porzingis prior to his trade to Dallas, league sources said.
Absent from the new list are the Boston Celtics, league sources said. The Celtics are unable to trade for Davis until July 1 as long as Kyrie Irving is on the team's roster, based on the fact that they both are under the provision of the designated rookie extension.
Nevertheless, the Celtics remain determined to acquire Davis after the season, and Celtics GM Danny Ainge has directly urged Demps to wait until the offseason, when the Celtics have promised to be aggressive with their wealth of draft and player assets to try to acquire Davis, league sources said. Ainge is eager to trade for Davis and pair him with Irving, sources said.
Boston's plan to pursue Davis remains unaffected by whatever decision Irving might make in summer free agency, league sources said. Irving, 26, previously said he planned to re-sign with the Celtics in the summer but has recently wavered in public on that promise. Although the Celtics can't be sure about Irving's forthcoming decision in July, they remain confident that he'll choose to stay in Boston, sources said. The Celtics also believe that a deal for Davis will help solidify his confidence in re-signing with the organization, sources said.
Still, Davis' camp has been engaged in an aggressive campaign to push back on the possibility of the All-Star center's future in Boston, encouraging the Pelicans to do a deal with the Lakers or another preferred team before Boston has a chance to become active in deal talks in the offseason. The best chance Davis has to force his way to the Lakers is by creating a level of chaos and uncertainty in the marketplace about his privately stated wishes. The league's landscape is certainly feeling the tremors of the campaign by Paul and Davis.
The Celtics could have access to four first-round picks in the June draft. New Orleans is determined that any deal for Davis will include a young player returning to them who has the potential to become an All-NBA performer -- a first-, second- or third-team player, sources said. The Pelicans could wait until the draft lottery in May, when they'll have a better idea of when and how Boston's protected picks in deals with Philadelphia, Memphis and the Clippers could be conveyed in a deal.
Also, the Pelicans could risk improving their draft status and costing themselves the ability to get a higher pick in the draft by bringing back the core of young Lakers players. There's a real possibility that the Pelicans and Davis could agree on a limited playing schedule post-trade deadline, but that's undetermined.
What's more, there's a small possibility that the Knicks could win the draft lottery and become viable candidates for a trade. There are also always three- and four-team trade scenarios that could open up new player and draft-pick possibilities to the Pelicans in the offseason. The Pelicans believe that the Lakers' bid at the trade deadline will still be available to them in the offseason, sources said. Several rival GMs believe that New Orleans could use the Lakers' final offer at the deadline as the baseline for offers in the offseason.
Davis, who requested a trade a week ago through Paul, can't become a free agent until July 2020. He has no plans to sign an extension with any team this summer, expecting to do so when he becomes a free agent. Davis informed the Pelicans that he wouldn't sign a five-year, $239 million supermax contract this summer or next.

25960564,"Abrines has appeared in only two games since Dec. 23, sitting out because of personal reasons. The team and Abrines mutually decided for the 6-foot-6 guard to be released, with Abrines determining it best to step away from basketball to focus on his personal issue.
Abrines played six minutes against the Magic on Jan. 29, and nine minutes against the Heat on Feb. 1. He was around the team while dealing with the undisclosed personal matter, with the Thunder organization offering as much support as possible.
The second transaction season is officially here.
From choreographed dance moves at the 3-point line to heaving pinpoint passes through traffic, The Beard is putting on a historic show. Are you not entertained?
""He's still battling through some things and wasn't able to be here tonight,"" coach Billy Donovan said Tuesday after Abrines was included on the active roster but was not at the game. ""Honestly, we go day by day with him and continue to be supportive with him. He's around the team, we always talk and communicate.""
Abrines, 25, was selected 32nd overall in the 2013 draft by the Thunder after playing professionally in Spain. He signed with the Thunder in 2016 after four seasons with FC Barcelona, where he was named the EuroLeague Rising Star.
Known for his perimeter shooting, Abrines struggled to find a rhythm from 3 this season, though he hit a career-high seven 3s against Atlanta in November. He was expected to be a significant role player for the Thunder, providing floor spacing alongside Russell Westbrook and Paul George.
Abrines is set to be a restricted free agent this summer, though it's unknown what's next for him in his professional basketball career.
After trading Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot to the Bulls last week, the Thunder are now down to 12 guaranteed roster players. By rule, they will need to add two players within the next two weeks. It's likely they will use 10-day contracts to fill the void while waiting on the buyout picture to clear. Players are eligible for the playoffs as long as they are waived by March 1.
In 31 games this season, Abrines is averaging 5.3 points and 1.5 rebounds per game. For his career, Abrines has appeared in 174 games, averaging 5.3 points and shooting 36.8 percent from 3.

25902818,"There are really two separate NBA trade deadlines: the Anthony Davis/Kyrie Irving/LeBron James/Kristaps Porzingis nexus of superstar drama, and everyone else trying to do normal trade deadline things.
The superstar nexus will get even frothier in July. An underrated subplot: How teams fare in the postseason could have an unusual impact on superstar free agency. At least one of Philadelphia (Jimmy Butler), Boston (Irving), and Toronto (Kawhi Leonard) will lose before the conference finals. How will those star free agents react? What happens if catastrophe strikes Golden State (Klay Thompson, and more notably, Kevin Durant)?
Let's bounce around the rest of the league:
• We know the Hawks, Cavaliers, Bulls, and Grizzlies are selling their veterans with the zeal of Crazy Eddie. We know the Pelicans have been forced into holding trade talks for a future Hall of Famer; they have also made Nikola Mirotic, Julius Randle and E'Twaun Moore available, sources have told ESPN. We know that Bradley Beal, Kemba Walker, and Otto Porter Jr. probably aren't available, though Porter has drawn preliminary interest over the past few months from Utah, Portland, Dallas, and some other buyers, per league sources.
So which teams might swing the market?
• Some within the Magic -- their coach, Steve Clifford, and higher-ups who predate the Jeff Weltman/John Hammond front office -- are desperate to make the playoffs. Weltman and Hammond probably don't feel the same urgency; only the past two seasons are on their watch, and they appear to have a long runway. They are also five games out in the loss column.
They would likely deal Terrence Ross for a future asset, though it's unclear if they can snag even a heavily-protected first-round pick for him. (Two second-rounders might end up being the price.) They would demand much more for Nikola Vucevic, an All-Star heading toward a massive new contract. They face two alternatives in July: lose Vucevic for nothing, or pay him a giant amount to man the position they hope Mo Bamba assumes during the life of Vucevic's next deal. Given those parameters, they have to consider trading him.Editor's PicksLowe Post: Dirk on Porzingis and LukaZach talks to Dirk Nowitzki about the Porzingis trade, Luka Mania, and the highs and lows of his career.Lowe: Ten things I like and don't like, including Boogie's grooveThis week we highlight Philly making it work, Devin Booker's passing woes and All-Star snubs.1 Related
Zach talks to Dirk Nowitzki about the Porzingis trade, Luka Mania, and the highs and lows of his career.
This week we highlight Philly making it work, Devin Booker's passing woes and All-Star snubs.
As I've written before, Vucevic for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the Lakers' first-round pick -- potentially a late lottery pick -- is among my very favorite hypothetical deals. (So is Ross for Markelle Fultz, though it's unclear if the Magic might have to toss in something extra -- a second-rounder -- to make that happen. Fultz's trade value, like his injury, is a total mystery.)
The Magic might turn their noses up at receiving a middling first-round pick for their best player. The league as a whole has no feel for Weltman's plan. I'm not sure Orlando will get much better than that sort of pick and perhaps one other asset.
That raises the possibility they simply keep Vucevic. He just turned 28. Bamba is not ready; the Magic over the last month have split up Bamba and Jonathan Isaac because teams are destroying Orlando with those two on the floor.
I'd bet against a Vucevic deal, though the Magic's recent slide should have them more interested in selling than they were two weeks ago.
• A player-centric version of this question that is fun to bat around with executives and agents: Who might be available -- or at least gettable -- that we don't expect? I keep coming back to Aaron Gordon. The Magic designed his descending contract to make him ultra-tradable. Like Vucevic, he just doesn't fit a long-term vision that has Bamba and Isaac starting.
The Pacers sniffed around an offer sheet for Gordon. Utah could use one more infusion of talent. How fun would a Gordon-John Collins frontline look in Atlanta? Would Portland gamble on Gordon's long-term fit next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum? (They almost certainly wouldn't trade McCollum straight up for Gordon.)
The Blazers love Al-Farouq Aminu. They would aim to keep him. Aminu fits best at power forward -- Gordon's position. Then again, is there really a difference between a Maurice Harkless-Aminu forward combination and a Gordon-Aminu pairing? What about the Spurs? Dallas investigated Gordon's availability before the Porzingis deal, sources have said.
Gordon would mark a bold play for someone. But the Magic need him to stay competitive. They know his trade value will only increase as his contract declines and the salary cap rises.
• Portland stands a potential buyer -- an under-the-radar really good team with questions about its postseason viability. The Trail Blazers have put their first-round pick in play, per sources around the league. They have investigated Porter's availability. Taurean Prince makes some sense; he's up for an extension this summer, and the Hawks have made him available, sources say. As a free agent non-destination, the Blazers value players whose rights they can control.
But the Hawks are asking a lot so far -- a young player and a pick -- and haven't gotten much traction on Prince trades, sources say.
Another off-the-beaten path name from Orlando: Evan Fournier -- a wing who could give Portland or some other team some shooting and playmaking. He has two years and $34 million left on his contract; if the Magic aren't thrilled with that deal, they could suss out his value.
• Portland is also over the tax. Can the Blazers somehow improve their team and cut their current year's tax bill? Keep an eye on the Raptors making a move to trim their tax bill if they can find one that doesn't hurt their team.
• Charlotte will be over the tax next season as things stand now if they re-sign Kemba Walker, and it seems wildly implausible Michael Jordan will pay the tax for a mediocre team. Their ideal scenario is improving their current team and somehow trimming next season's tax bill. Good luck!
They have long been perhaps the most obvious fit for Marc Gasol, but it's unclear if they can send out enough bad long-term contracts -- to Memphis and/or a third team -- to make a deal.
There has not been much buzz about Gasol, though he is hoping for a trade, sources familiar with the matter say. Teams are waiting to see if the Grizzlies' asking price drops a bit, sources say. Memphis has not shown any real interest yet in Andre Drummond, sources say. Detroit might be saving other trade chips for someone else. Gasol's $26 million player option for next season brings a lot of uncertainty for any interested party.
• A ton of teams are set up to have major cap space this summer. Some of those teams are in markets with zero history of drawing A-level stars. The good teams among that group should think hard about cannibalizing some of that cap space now in deals that add good players.
The best current example: Utah's interest in Mike Conley, which is very real, sources say. Utah can build an offer around Ricky Rubio and Derrick Favors -- both on effectively expiring contracts -- and a lightly-protected future first-round pick. That is going to be Memphis' floor.
Utah would forfeit a max salary slot in that deal. They could still have significant room depending on a few other variables, but probably not enough to add even a second-tier free agent such as Khris Middleton or Tobias Harris. (The Jazz would have interest in Harris if they save space, per league sources.)
Memphis wants more than two veterans who can walk in a few months, plus a pick in the 20s, sources say. (One caveat: Memphis could try and flip Favors and Rubio for picks if they get them with enough time to spare before the deadline.) Utah can sweeten the pot with one of Dante Exum and Grayson Allen.
Utah is really good, and one upgrade from being potentially great. Rubio to Conley is one such upgrade. But there will always be some overlap in skill, and maybe some diminishing returns, pairing Donovan Mitchell with a ball-dominant point guard. Conley's 3-point shooting eases those concerns.2019 NBA trade deadlineWe've got you covered on the biggest deals going down at the NBA trade deadline.• All the trades, grades and intel

We've got you covered on the biggest deals going down at the NBA trade deadline.

• Trade tracker: Details on every move
• Davis is still a Pelican -- now what? 
• What's next for Markelle Fultz in Orlando?
• How good are the Raptors with Gasol?
• Trade machine: You be the GM
But an upgrade on the wing or at power forward brings more pop. I doubt Utah throws in a second first-round pick, so Conley talks could pivot on Exum. Utah might be holding firm on its floor offer (no Exum), betting no one beats it. The Jazz might be proven right. This weekend will be interesting.
• If Conley proves too pricey, the Jazz could move onto a cheaper rental -- someone like Mirotic.
• The same cap reasoning made Indiana an appealing Conley suitor before Victor Oladipo's season-ending injury: Who is Indiana signing in free agency that is better than Conley? (One potential answer, sources say: Middleton. But luring a good player away from a contending team like the Bucks is really hard unless Milwaukee gets too cute in negotiations with Middleton.) You could argue Oladipo's injury, and what it does to Indiana's playoff hopes, shouldn't really alter their plans -- even amid a losing streak. If they wanted Conley before they should want him now for the same reason: He sets them up to be very good next season.
Building an offer is tricky. To make the money work, Indiana can really offer only expiring contracts, and all of the movable ones are linked to primary ball handlers: Darren Collison, Cory Joseph, and Tyreke Evans. (The Pacers want to re-sign Bojan Bogdanovic, also working on an expiring contract, sources say.) They could toss in their 2019 first-round pick, but that might not be of much interest to the Grizzlies.
Adding Aaron Holiday gets you close -- and maybe all the way there -- but it also costs yet another ball handler. They could find a third team to supply some matching salary, so they could keep one of those point guards. In any case, the current buzz is that Indiana has stepped away from Conley talks, sources say.
• The Grizzlies probably would ask for Domantas Sabonis, and the Pacers don't appear ready to go there. I do think Indiana will eventually have to choose between Sabonis and Myles Turner. I'm not sure they will ever mesh quite well enough for Indiana to play them the sort of heavy minutes together -- like, say, 20-plus per game -- that would justify paying them something like $40 million combined per season. (Sabonis will be up for an extension this summer, and you can bet he wants -- and deserves -- a monster deal.)
Both should remain positive trade assets. Turner's four-year, $72 million extension already looks like a tidy deal. I don't expect a deal at the deadline, but you can never rule it out. Teams sometimes sell high before we expect it.
• Detroit remains my favorite Conley team, though Memphis would likely have to swallow Reggie Jackson's contract -- or reroute him to a third team -- to snare one or two nice assets from the Pistons (perhaps a lightly-protected first-round pick and one of Detroit's young wings.)
The teams have talked, but not gotten far, sources say. It's unclear if there are any other serious bidders. Everyone around the Conley sweepstakes expects it to heat up over the weekend.
• Some of Miami's veterans on long-term deals once fit this conceit, but most of the guys they'd be willing to move for some relief -- i.e., not Justise Winslow, Josh Richardson or Bam Adebayo -- have underwhelmed. Given their glut of rotation guys -- Wayne Ellington, essential last season, was out of the rotation until recently -- I'd expect Miami to try to recoup at least a second-round pick for someone who isn't playing as much as he'd like.
• Dallas was super-active before going all-in for Porzingis. The move carries enormous risk beyond Porzingis' injury history. Dallas will hold its own pick only every other year for at least the next half-decade. They ate way into their cap space. How are they going to build around Luka Doncic and Porzingis?
In a way, this trade is a bald admission from the Mavericks that they have botched or ignored both the draft and free agency for most of the past 15 years. (For a while there, Roddy Beaubois was the crown jewel of their post-Dirk first-round picks.) Why bother with tools that don't work all that well for you? But those are two of the three pathways toward team building. The other is trading players. But what do the Mavs have left to trade?
That's why I'm keeping an eye on both Harrison Barnes and Dwight Powell over the next few days. Dallas right now has about $99 million in salary committed for next season -- leaving the Mavs only $10 million in room. Barnes and Powell both hold player options for 2019-20: Barnes for $25 million, Powell for about $10.3 million. The Mavs will have a couple of windows to try free agency again before both Doncic and Porzingis cycle onto massive new contracts. (By the way: I'll believe Porzingis takes his one-year qualifying offer when I see it. Pure posturing.)
Unloading Barnes or Powell for an expiring contract would open up another such free agency window this summer. The Mavericks have sniffed around Barnes deals, including the possibility of flipping him for Otto Porter -- a move that would effectively work as a free agency signing, sources say. But that was before the Porzingis stunner, and Washington doesn't appear to have had any interest, sources say.NBA Trade Machine: You be the GMCould your team land a superstar?

• JaMychal Green, Justin Holiday, and Garrett Temple are all available, per league sources. The Grizz would surely like to recoup at least one of the second-rounders they flipped for Holiday.
• The Kings are still sitting there with the only meaningful chunk of cap room left -- about $11 million -- waiting to use it to pick up an asset, sources say. That could be a pick. It could be a player who helps them now. The Kings are so far trying to thread the needle: stay competitive in case they pull off a run for the No. 8 seed without taking on money beyond this season.
They haven't shown nearly as much interest in Gasol as has been reported, per league sources. They have a package that makes sense -- Willie Cauley-Stein, salary filler, and a future first-round pick -- but I don't get the sense the Kings are willing to part with a pick for Gasol. They already owe this season's pick to Boston. Gasol is an odd fit for their turbo style. His $26.5 million player option looms.
There are non-stars on long-term deals the Kings like enough to sacrifice future space. Porter has been one such player, per league sources. If they don't find one, they might step back and use their space to act as a facilitator.
• The Kings are willing to talk about Cauley-Stein separately, sources say. He's a restricted free agent this summer. Sacramento could bail if the market goes above a certain price point. (He shouldn't have that kind of market, but you never know.) In that case, they should search out what they could get for him now. Marvin Bagley III and Harry Giles are coming.
• Cleveland will keep trying to sell Alec Burks and any other indispensable asset until the buzzer. They are willing to take on more dead money for picks. Houston will peddle a future first-round pick attached to Marquese Chriss and Brandon Knight until the buzzer. The league might be devaluing Houston's future first-rounders -- Chris Paul is 33 and hurt all the time -- but the Rockets would surely push to slap lottery protection on picks stretching beyond James Harden's prime.
Houston has discussed sending Knight and a pick for Burks, but those talks have quieted, sources say. They will also monitor the buyout market. Houston still has about $3.9 million of its taxpayer midlevel exception to spend, giving the Rockets a potential leg there.
• The Bulls will listen to offers for anyone other than Lauri Markkanen and Wendell Carter Jr., sources say -- and that includes Kris Dunn and Zach LaVine. The biggest question about Chicago going into the season was whether any of their main ball handlers -- Dunn, LaVine, and Jabari Parker when the Bulls were pretending he was a wing -- would emerge as someone who could orchestrate an above-average NBA offense. The answer has been an emphatic no. I would not bet on Dunn or LaVine getting dealt; they are still young, the Bulls would ask for a ton, and they need, like, some guards on next season's team. But any rival enamored with them should call.
• I still think the Clippers should at least see what they could get for one of their veterans -- Patrick Beverley, Avery Bradley, maybe even Lou Williams. (They could 100 percent nab a future first-round pick for Williams.) They are making and taking calls like everyone else, but do not appear motivated to do much of anything, sources say. Again: We still have five-plus days. But the Clippers are deep enough that they could trade a veteran for something and not really hurt their current team.
Other teams have called about Tobias Harris, but the Clips have so far shown no inclination to deal him, sources say. They would happily re-sign him if July goes a certain way for them.
• All is quiet in Denver. The Nuggets have two sizable trade exceptions, and can take on $5 to $7 million without bumping back into the tax. They are open for business for smaller salary dumps if it helps two other teams make a deal, sources say.

25969086,"The New York Knicks used an image of rookie center Mitchell Robinson playing alongside the Golden State Warriors' Kevin Durant in a pitch to season-ticket holders, then deleted the picture to avoid the perception that the organization had an ulterior motive in including Durant, who will be a 2019 free agent, in the pitch.
""Game action photos are used all the time for marketing purposes, but given everything going on, we took the precaution of taking the photo down,"" the Knicks said in a statement Sunday night. ""To be clear, it was one of several rotating photos on the website.""
It is not unheard of for teams to use stars from opposing teams in marketing material. The Knicks, though, have been closely linked to Durant, a two-time NBA Finals MVP, in free agency. The association caused a stir when a Knicks season-ticket holder pointed out the photo in a social media post.
Knicks are asking season ticket holders for renewals by Feb 28 and using this image to get them to opt in. @IanBegley @SBondyNYDN @Schmeelk @TommyBeer pic.twitter.com/Rz3oPZnZMW
The photo was part of a pitch to season-ticket holders to renew their packages for the 2019-20 season. It included a link to learn more about renewal information. The deadline for season-ticket renewals is later this month, and the Knicks (10-45) have tied a single-season franchise record with 16 consecutive losses.
New York hopes to turn things around quickly, beginning in the offseason. The Knicks will likely have a high pick in the 2019 NBA draft and project to have roughly $70 million in cap space this summer -- enough for two max contracts.
No matter where he spends the rest of his career, Kevin Durant is determined to set himself up for success for the rest of his life.
Opposing teams expect the Knicks to be aggressive in pursuing the top free agents in the coming offseason, a group that includes Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving.
Some close to Durant see New York as a possible landing spot for the back-to-back NBA Finals MVP if he chooses to leave the Warriors, according to league sources.

25980554,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Michael Jordan said James Harden's streak of 30 straight 30-point games and Russell Westbrook's 10 straight triple-doubles are both impressive and tough to accomplish.
But the Charlotte Hornets' owner said Tuesday -- flashing a big grin -- that there is one accomplishment tougher than both of those feats: ""Which is harder from the player's standpoint? Six championships, by all means.""
Russell Westbrook made history Monday night with his 10th consecutive triple-double, passing Wilt Chamberlain's mark of nine straight set in 1968.
James Harden, limited to 11 points at halftime, got on a roll in the second half despite a bothersome shoulder to pull within one 30-point game of tying Wilt Chamberlain for the second-longest 30-point streak in NBA history.
Jordan, who won six titles with the Chicago Bulls in the 1990s, praised both players for what they're doing, noting that both streaks are hard to accomplish.
Jordan said the milestones show ""the talent that we have within the league.""
""It shows progression in the league,"" Jordan said during an interview at the Hornets' facility while discussing the upcoming All-Star Weekend. ""I am very proud of how both guys have done because they are making a mark for the league, and I think it really helps grow the league.""
Harden needed a late scoring spree on Monday night to extend his streak to 30 games, scoring 11 points in the final 100 seconds as the Rockets defeated the Dallas Mavericks 120-104. Harden, who is playing with a strained left shoulder, reached the 30-point mark by swishing a 30-foot pull-up jumper with 52.9 seconds remaining.
Westbrook finished with 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists to notch his 10th straight triple-double in the Thunder's 120-111 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, breaking a tie with Wilt Chamberlain for the most consecutive triple-doubles.
Both players will be in Charlotte this weekend for the All-Star Game.

LeVert, 24, had appeared to be on his way to an All-Star season for the Nets, averaging 18.4 points and showing the promise of one of the conference's rising stars. The Nets are 28-26 and holding on to sixth in the Eastern Conference race and expect to get back guard Spencer Dinwiddie from a thumb injury in late February or early March.
LeVert was the 20th overall pick in the 2016 draft.

25912216,"SAN ANTONIO -- The dark and empty AT&T Center buzzed with animated discussion Saturday morning among the New Orleans Pelicans after their shootaround.
But instead of the obvious conversation focused on Anthony Davis, who requested a trade Monday through his agent, Rich Paul, of Klutch Sports, Jrue Holiday and a couple of Pelicans argued the virtues of various fast-food franchises with the discussion delving as deep as lighting and ambiance.
The scene only bolstered what Holiday would say seconds later.
""Nothing has really changed,"" Holiday told ESPN. ""It's just that people keep asking us the question: 'Is it weird?'""
We've got you covered on the biggest deals going down at the NBA trade deadline.

• Davis is still a Pelican -- now what? 
• What's next for Markelle Fultz in Orlando?

With Davis (left index finger sprain) sitting at the end of the bench in a tan blazer and jeans, the shorthanded Pelicans hit the court for their 113-108 loss to the San Antonio Spurs also missing Nikola Mirotic (right calf strain), Julius Randle (right ankle sprain), E'Twaun Moore (bruised left quadriceps), and Elfrid Payton (right ankle sprain).
So at 23-30 staring up from near the bottom of the Western Conference standings with a slew of injuries, New Orleans insists Davis' situation isn't a distraction.
""Not really, it's just more so the media keeps asking us if it's a distraction, or asking me,"" Holiday said. ""I feel like we've had two games [coming into Saturday] where we played very, very well, and having Anthony there, he's been the ultimate professional and friend, not just to me, but everybody on the team.""
The latter certainly appeared to be the case after the team's morning shootaround, which Davis attended dressed in full practice gear. As the team boarded a charter bus to leave the arena Saturday morning, Davis could be seen joking and chatting with teammates.
Then, hours later, New Orleans would find a way to make the matchup against a surging Spurs squad interesting, despite trailing by 22 points with 5:55 left. The Pelicans embarked on a 24-5 run to chop San Antonio's lead to just three with 38 seconds left on Frank Jackson's layup.
That's as close as New Orleans would get.
""We never give up,"" Holiday said. ""I feel like people think we're shorthanded or maybe that we're going to get blown out, but we haven't had many blowouts this year, and that's because we're always going to fight until there's zero on the clock, no matter who is playing.""
LaMarcus Aldridge scores 25 and grabs 14 boards in the Spurs' 113-108 win vs. the Pelicans.
In the moments before tipoff as Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry addressed the media, Davis sat in a private space on an examination table inside the visiting locker room receiving ultrasound treatment from the medical staff on his sprained left index finger. Davis said the team would re-evaluate the injury after Saturday's game, and his intention is to suit up and play once cleared to participate.
Given his own experience last season in dealing with Kawhi Leonard's trade demands, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was asked whether he provided any advice to Gentry, whom he calls a friend.
""No, that's none of my business,"" Popovich said.
But Popovich did greet Davis at the conclusion of Saturday's game, and the two spoke briefly.
The NBA trade deadline arrives Thursday, and Davis remains under contract through 2020. So despite recent trade offers from the Los Angeles Lakers that were deemed underwhelming by the club, the Pelicans could wait until the offseason to deal Davis, when the Boston Celtics, who are also interested in trading for the five-time All-Star, would be in better position to make a stronger offer.
If Davis remains with the Pelicans beyond the trade deadline, the situation could force Gentry to make the difficult and awkward decision of whether to play Davis or bench him for the rest of the season.
Davis has missed the past seven games because of the finger injury but expects to be cleared soon to play.
Gentry was noncommittal Friday when asked whether Davis would play again for the Pels when healthy, saying, ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.""
Still, the Davis situation doesn't come without ripple effects, not just within the Pelicans' organization, but probably league wide. Sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski that as part of discussions regarding Davis around the league, teams are now contacting New Orleans about possibly moving Holiday. But the Pelicans have indicated no interest in trading him.
Beyond this season, Holiday still has three years and $77 million remaining on his contract, which runs through 2022.
Holiday signed the five-year deal worth $125 million in the summer of 2017, and said at the time that Davis' presence played ""like 90 percent"" of a role in his decision to re-sign.
Holiday didn't walk back those comments Saturday, stressing he empathized with Davis' desire to do what's in his best interests.
""One of the reasons why I came back was because of Anthony,"" Holiday told ESPN. ""But I also know that he has to do what's best for him. But that doesn't stop my mentality of going out on the court and trying to win. Every time I get on the court, I feel like I pour my heart out. I exhaust myself. And I'm always going to do that no matter who is on the court.""
With Davis out and injuries permeating the roster, several players have received increased minutes such as Jackson, who played a team-high 42 minutes and led New Orleans in scoring with a career-high 25 points. Darius Miller played 33 minutes, scoring 11 points, and Holiday contributed 15 points and four assists.
""I think what is happening is they're on the court together a lot right now because of the injuries that we have, and they're playing for each other, playing hard and competing,"" Gentry said. ""They know that this is an opportunity for them to establish themselves in the league.""
Added Popovich: ""With all the guys out for New Orleans, they've been playing well, beating Houston, [and] they had an opportunity to beat Denver the other night. They've really pulled together, played well and played hard.""
Holiday, meanwhile, entered the matchup against the Spurs averaging career highs in points (21.2) and rebounds (4.9), and his eight assists per game ties a career high.
He didn't hesitate when asked whether he was concerned how Davis' situation might affect his own future.
""Not even a little bit,"" Holiday said. ""Unless I hear something from upper management where I'm going to be traded or something like that, I plan to keep trying to win every game that I step on the court wearing a Pelicans jersey.""

25946881,"The Knicks had talked to teams about potential trades for the past several weeks, sources said, but Kanter's $18.6 million expiring contract proved too difficult to move at Thursday's deadline.
""From the moment he arrived in New York, Enes passionately embraced our franchise and our city,"" Knicks general manager Scott Perry said in a statement. ""He is a courageous individual and we thank him for his many contributions both on the court and in the community. We wish him the absolute best moving forward, personally and professionally.""
Zach Lowe breaks down the teams and players on notice after a whirlwind trade deadline.
After a flurry of trades, which teams are looking worse and which ones got stronger?
Kanter, a vocal critic of Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Turkish government, skipped the Knicks' game in London last month over fears for his safety.
The 26-year-old issued a statement after his release on Twitter, saying he wishes ""nothing but the best"" for the Knicks.
""Each day I spend in the NBA is a blessing and I look forward to my next adventure,"" Kanter posted. ""... As grateful as I am [to the Knicks], I am also excited to continue playing basketball and showcasing that I can be one of the most dominant forces in the paint. New York will always have a special place in my heart and I look forward to returning here and playing in front of these amazing fans again.""
The Boston Celtics are among the teams opposing executives expect to have interest in Kanter.
Matthews, who has an expiring contract, plans to sign with the Indiana Pacers, sources told ESPN. He was traded to New York by the Dallas Mavericks as part of the Kristaps Porzingis deal. He averaged 13.1 points in 44 starts for the Mavericks this season, his 10th in the league.
The Houston Rockets were among the playoff teams who had interest in signing Matthews after his buyout, sources said.

The Athletic first reported the planned agreement between Matthews and Indiana.
Kanter, 26, had appeared in just three of the Knicks' past 12 games and had been vocal about his displeasure over his reduced role.
Coach David Fizdale has prioritized playing and developing younger players in recent weeks. Newly acquired DeAndre Jordan has started ahead of Kanter, and Fizdale said he wanted Jordan to help younger players Luke Kornet and Mitchell Robinson learn how to defend.
Kanter has averaged 14 points and 10.5 rebounds -- tied for 12th in the league -- in just 25.6 minutes per game this season, but he ranked last out of 68 qualified centers in ESPN's defensive real plus-minus metric. He is tied for third in the NBA in offensive rebounding (3.9 per game) since the start of the 2017-18 season.
The Knicks (10-43) acquired Kanter in a 2017 trade that sent Carmelo Anthony to the Oklahoma City Thunder.
New York didn't execute any trades before Thursday's deadline. The Orlando Magic expressed interest in Frank Ntilikina but were told that New York was not trading the second-year guard, sources told ESPN. The club also received interest in recent days for big man Noah Vonleh, sources said. Vonleh, a free agent this summer, is having a strong season (8.6 points, 8.5 rebounds per game) in New York.
The Knicks also decided to keep Jordan, despite suggestions that the veteran would be bought out. The club now has three open roster spots. New York also has roughly $70 million in cap space this summer -- enough for two max contracts.
Opposing teams expect the Knicks to be aggressive in pursuing the top free agents in the coming offseason, a group that includes Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving.
Some close to Durant see New York as a possible landing spot for the back-to-back NBA Finals MVP if he chooses to leave the Golden State Warriors, according to league sources.

25946412,"The Philadelphia 76ers traded 2017 No. 1 overall pick Markelle Fultz to the Orlando Magic on Thursday.
Fultz bid Philly and its fans farewell in a tweet shortly after the deal was announced.
Thank you to my teammates, Sixers Fans, the organization, and all those who have supported me as I rehab from TOS.  I wish the sixers and the fans well as they pursue a championship. pic.twitter.com/nn2MIV6HGX
The Magic sent forward Jonathon Simmons, a protected 2020 first-round pick (via Oklahoma City) and a 2019 second-round pick to the Sixers.
Fultz has been sidelined since Nov. 19 after being diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, a condition that affects the nerves between the neck and shoulder.
Asked when the Magic expected Fultz to play, president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman said: ""We're going to do it right, we're not going to do it fast.""
Zach Lowe breaks down the teams and players on notice after a whirlwind trade deadline.
Can Fultz be the answer at point guard in Orlando? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
After a flurry of trades, which teams are looking worse and which ones got stronger?
""We look forward to getting him in here, getting our arms around him, understanding everything he's dealing with and getting him through it,'' Weltman said.
Fultz's agent, Raymond Brothers, had told ESPN on Christmas Day that his client is progressing well in rehabilitation on his right shoulder and that he expects Fultz to return to the team this season.
""We want to make sure he's 100 percent and healthy when he does come back,"" Brothers said.
The point guard is averaging 8.2 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 19 games this season. He has played in only 33 games total in his two NBA seasons.
Simmons is averaging 6.9 points, 2.4 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 41 games this season.

25940969,"The Houston Rockets have acquired guard Iman Shumpert in a three-way deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Sacramento Kings.
The Rockets sent guard Brandon Knight, forward Marquese Chriss, a 2019 lottery-protected first-round pick and a 2022 second-round pick to the Cavaliers. The Cavaliers, who announced the trade on Thursday, sent guard Alec Burks to the Kings and guards Nik Stauskas and Wade Baldwin and a 2021 second-round pick (via Milwaukee) to the Rockets. The Kings will also get the Rockets' 2020 second-round pick.
With three teams trading six players and two draft picks, Kevin Pelton grades the move.
Stauskas and Baldwin were acquired in a deal with Portland on Sunday that sent Rodney Hood to the Trail Blazers.
Shumpert, 28, has had a strong season for the resurgent Kings, averaging 8.9 points, 3.1 rebounds and 2.2 assists. He is expected to play a significant bench role for the Rockets in their Western Conference playoff push.
Rockets point guard Chris Paul said he was excited about adding Shumpert's defensive mentality to the team.
""I've known Shump for a while, man,"" Paul said. ""He's scrappy. He gets after it. And somebody like that, I can play with any day of the week.""
James Harden echoed Paul's excitement over the addition of Shumpert and praised the Rockets for being active before the trade deadline.

Meanwhile, Kings center Willie Cauley-Stein said Shumpert's personality and presence will be missed in the Sacramento locker room.
""He created a movement here,"" Cauley-Stein said. ""I like to think that he had the chemistry [on] point, him and JJ [Justin Jackson]. So it was real quiet, all around, today it was real quiet. The energy, it was done. Even in the building, the energy was weird.""

25982867,"Thomas, who was upgraded to questionable for the Nuggets game against Sacramento in Denver, will make a determination about playing earlier in the day on Wednesday, league sources said. Thomas practiced five-on-five again on Tuesday with the Nuggets.
Thomas, 29, would be making his first appearance with a Nuggets (38-15) team that is currently within 2.5 games of first place Golden State in the West, and employing a bevy of talented guards, including Jamal Murray, Gary Harris, Malik Beasley, Will Barton and Monte Morris. Thomas averaged 28.9 points per game for the Boston Celtics in 2016-17, a second-team All-NBA season that appeared to be clearing the way for a long-term, $100 million contract.
Nevertheless, an injury on the same right hip that cut short his playoffs in 2017 and cost him eight months of rehab, and a trade to the Cleveland Cavaliers last summer, upended his hopes for that kind of long-term deal. Thomas joined the Los Angeles Lakers last season as part of a trade-deadline deal with Cleveland, where he played only 15 games in 2017-18.
With the Lakers, Thomas played in 17 games and mostly came off the bench, averaging 15.6 points and 5.0 assists.
He signed a one-year, $2 million deal with the Nuggets in July.

25954077,"There have been two behind-the-scenes dramas happening with Anthony Davis over the past week.
One was his trade demand from the New Orleans Pelicans. The other was what would happen in the event the Pelicans didn't trade him, which looked more likely by the day. Would New Orleans continue to play Davis or make him a healthy scratch for the rest of the season, as they did for several games before Thursday's trade deadline?
Met with boos and cheers in his return to the Pelicans' lineup Friday in New Orleans, Anthony Davis said he was surprised by the jeers but was ""just happy to be back on the floor playing the game that I love.""
The two storied franchises have battled for championships through the decades. With the backdrop of a thrilling finish Thursday night, their next battle will come this summer as both teams try to land the coveted Pelicans star.
Zach Lowe breaks down the teams and players on notice after a whirlwind trade deadline.
Two days before the deadline, Rich Paul, Davis' agent, called the league office and expressed concern that the Pelicans wouldn't play Davis if he weren't traded, sources told ESPN. Paul told the league that Davis wanted to play.
Given that a possible injury could affect future trade value and perhaps improve draft positions, there was a growing expectation that the Pelicans might put Davis on ice for the last 27 games of the season.
The Pelicans, as they dealt with the Davis situation and other matters around the trade deadline (they made two deals), put the final decision off. At the time, there were some voices within the organization supporting the option to not play him, sources said.
After reviewing its rules, the league office informed the Pelicans that they would be expected to play Davis, starting with Friday night's nationally televised game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, sources said.
The league referred the Pelicans to rules put in place in 2017 that restrict teams from resting healthy players. The Pelicans, league sources said, were told that they would be subject to a fine of $100,000 per every game if Davis were benched.
Davis was fined $50,000 last week for breaking league rules when Paul publicly made a trade demand, the largest fine permitted.
Ryen Russillo breaks down the Pelicans' decision to not play Anthony Davis in back-to-back games or in the 4th quarter of their game vs. the Timberwolves.
After the trade deadline passed with Davis remaining on the team, the Pelicans requested a meeting with Davis to discuss the rest of the season. In that meeting, Davis told the Pelicans that he wanted to return to the floor -- he recently missed three weeks with a finger injury -- and play in as many games as possible.
The Pelicans knew they would likely lose in arbitration if they benched Davis. But there was an option of drastically reducing his playing time. After discussions, the team decided it would act ""ethically"" and return Davis to his previous role as starter and centerpiece of the team, sources said. They also want to follow league rules.
Although it might cost them draft position -- the Pelicans are 21-21 when Davis plays and 4-10 when he doesn't this season -- and risk injury, the team wanted to respect Davis' wishes, sources said.
Davis and the team agreed that he would not play in back-to-backs -- likely starting with Saturday's game in Memphis after he had 32 points and 9 rebounds in 25 minutes in Friday's 122-117 win -- and that his minutes would possibly be reduced. An agreement was reached that Davis will consult with the team on which ends of back-to-backs he will play in the rest of the season, sources said.
Ultimately, the understanding avoided a standoff that might've dragged into next weekend's All-Star Game, in which Davis will be representing the Pelicans.

25940828,"The Washington Wizards traded forward Otto Porter Jr. to the Chicago Bulls for forwards Bobby Portis and Jabari Parker and a protected 2023 second-round draft pick, the teams announced Wednesday night.
Porter, 25, is averaging 12.6 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game this season. He is making $26 million this season and is owed $27.25 million next season, with a player option for 2020-21.
Portis will become a restricted free agent this summer.
What does this mean for the Bulls and Wizards? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
The Wizards traded Markieff Morris to the Pelicans for Wesley Johnson.
The Bulls have been trying to trade Parker, who has a team option for next season worth $20 million.
Portis and Parker left Chicago's United Center shortly before the Bulls tipped off against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday. Parker was expected to leave for Washington on Thursday morning, his father told ESPN.
Several Bulls players said they were sad to see Portis and Parker go. Bulls guard Zach LaVine called Parker ""the main glue of the team, a big-time voice.""
""It sucks. He's one of my best friends on the team,"" LaVine said. ""Jabari and me talk all the time. It sucks he didn't get the way he wanted to come here. A Chicago kid, I don't think he got the fair end of the stick on that one. It's the NBA, man.""
""Those two are great players, and they're gonna go out there, and they're going to be ready. Y'all know how I feel when I play against Minnesota,"" added LaVine, who began his career with the Timberwolves. ""They're going to feel the same way playing against us.""
News of the trade reached the Wizards' locker room about a half-hour before the team's game against the Milwaukee Bucks.
""It was a little weird,"" Wizards guard Bradley Beal said. ""But you have to be a professional about everything. Decisions are made. People come and go. It's unfortunate. Otto was a part of the franchise for a long time. All we can do is continue to move on.""
The trade comes one day after the Wizards announced that star point guard John Wall, already out for the season with a left heel injury, will miss most -- if not all -- of next season because he needs surgery on his left Achilles tendon.

Also Wednesday, the Wizards traded forward Markieff Morris to the New Orleans Pelicans for forward Wesley Johnson, the teams announced.
Washington's two trades will provide significant financial savings, moving the team $232,000 below the luxury tax threshold. Since the start of the season, the Wizards have saved $18.3 million toward the luxury tax.
Parker's $20 million team option needs to be exercised by June 29. Portis is on an expiring contract, and the Wizards will have until the end of June to submit a $3.6 million qualifying offer.
Beal said he is confident Porter will acclimate to his new team quickly.
""I know what he is capable of doing,"" Beal said. ""He has the ability to go lead a young team now. I know he will do well there. We will welcome Bobby, and we got Jabari too, right? So we will welcome both of them and keep moving forward.""

25925639,"As trade talks pick up between the Los Angeles Lakers and New Orleans Pelicans, LaVar Ball said he does not want to see son Lonzo Ball in New Orleans.
The Lakers have improved their offer to the Pelicans for Anthony Davis, but New Orleans has been made aware of a ""handful"" of teams Davis would be willing to sign with outside of the Lakers or Knicks.
""We want to be in L.A.,"" LaVar Ball told ESPN. ""But if he's traded, I don't want Lonzo in New Orleans. Phoenix is the best fit for him. And I am going to speak it into existence.""
As Thursday's trade deadline rapidly approaches, the Lakers are pursuing Anthony Davis, and ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Lakers are offering the Pelicans multiple young players, including Ball, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma, to go with draft picks and salary-cap relief.
The elder Ball wants the point guard, drafted second overall by the Lakers in 2017, to remain a Laker. He starred in high school at Chino Hills before playing one year at UCLA. But if Ball is going to be traded, LaVar Ball said he would rather see his son in Phoenix, where the Suns have been playing shooting guard Devin Booker at point guard. The Suns rank 17th in assists this season as they've tried different players at point guard. New Orleans has Jrue Holiday at the point.
In addition to having Booker as the franchise's star, Phoenix selected center Deandre Ayton with the top pick overall in last year's draft. Phoenix could be helped by an athletic, pass-first point guard like Ball.
The Suns' starting point guards average 8.6 points per game, the fewest among starting point guards in the league. That number drops to 6.9 points per game and 3.6 assists per game when taking out the games Booker started at point guard.
Ball has missed the past six games with a Grade 3 ankle sprain that will keep him out until late February at the earliest. He's averaging 9.9 points, 5.4 assists and 5.3 rebounds per game in his second season.

25983796,"After the Boston Celtics suffered a disappointing home loss to the LA Clippers on Saturday night -- a second straight game that saw Boston surrender a double-digit lead before going on to lose outright -- forward Marcus Morris decided he had some things to say.
""For me it's not really about the loss,"" Morris told reporters. ""It's about the attitudes that we're playing with. Guys are hanging their heads. It's just not fun. It's not fun. We're not competing at a high level. Even though we're winning, it's not fun. I don't see the joy in the game.
""I watch all these other teams around the league and guys are up on the bench, they're jumping on the court, they're doing all of this other stuff that looks like they're enjoying their teammates' success, they're enjoying everything, and they're playing together and they're playing to win. And when I look at us, I just see a bunch of individuals.""
And, just like that, the Celtics were plunged back into their latest state of full-on panic.
At least, that was the case until the Celtics -- without Kyrie Irving -- won on back-to-back nights in Philadelphia against the new-look 76ers and at home against the Detroit Pistons to head into the All-Star break on a high note.
Executive produced by Kevin Durant, The Boardroom will explore the most fascinating trends and innovative endeavors across the business of sports, featuring conversations with athletes, executives and business titans. Watch on ESPN+
This cycle, as topsy-turvy as it seems, perfectly encapsulates the way Boston's season has played out: Win a few games, and look like things are getting on track. Subsequently lose a game or two, allowing all hell to break loose. Then do it all over again.
It has been what has made this season so confusing not just for the Celtics, but for everyone -- from the media to the fans to other teams around the league -- trying to process just what this team will become. It also is why, with 24 games left before the playoffs, the Celtics -- despite all they have endured thus far -- should still be considered a force to be reckoned with once they get there.
Given the amount of drama that has surrounded the Celtics, it's easy to forget they still are on pace to win 52 games, and finish with home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. But given the expectations put upon them before the season, the fact Boston has lagged behind the Milwaukee Bucks and Toronto Raptors -- and, until the past couple of days, the 76ers, too -- has added to the underwhelming feelings surrounding this squad.
Boston's internal dynamics haven't helped. When a team has its own frustrations spill out into the public sphere as often as the Celtics have this season, it's hard for those outside of the team to take a longer view.
Over the course of an 82-game season, every team has moments when it gets frustrated. In Boston this season, though, it feels as though every loss has become its own existential crisis for the Celtics, and their fans, to deal with. The outburst from Morris following Saturday's loss was far from the first time Boston's players have had harsh words about their own play.
Irving is easily having his best individual season, but he has repeatedly taken aim at the team's younger players for not buying in to what needs to be done for the Celtics to have success. The younger players, meanwhile, (mainly Terry Rozier, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown) have at times bristled at Irving's criticism -- including, on some occasions, firing back through the media. Gordon Hayward's understandably uneven progress in his return from last season's gruesome leg and ankle injuries hasn't helped, as it has sapped away minutes and touches from those same young players who led the Celtics to within a few possessions of the NBA Finals last season.
Hayward goes through an extensive debriefing of the state of his game, and his recovery, after just about every game, with good performances signaling him turning a corner and bad ones highlighting how far he has to go. After close to three-quarters of a season of those, he's (also understandably) ready to be done having to go through daily discussions of his injury.
Meanwhile, all of that took a back seat over the past few weeks to the insufferable drama surrounding Anthony Davis, and whether he'd be traded by last week's trade deadline or whether he'd be available for Boston, which can't trade for him until Irving agrees to a new contract this summer.
The constant chatter of the Celtics having the most assets to send out in a Davis trade -- including not just draft picks, but young talent such as Tatum and Brown -- wore on the team. It arguably wore on Irving more than anyone else, as he showed during an interview session in New York on Feb. 1 when he cast doubt on his future in Boston.
""At the end of the day, I'm going to do what's best for my career, and that's just where it stands. That's just where it stands,"" Irving said. ""And my focus this season is winning a championship with the Boston Celtics. Obviously, we had goals coming into the season, and the primary goal is to win a championship. So that's where my focus is.""
When pressed further about his prior commitment to re-sign with the Celtics, Irving simply said, ""Ask me July 1.""
Jalen Rose says that this is the last season Kyrie Irving will be in a Celtics uniform, even though Boston will be worse without him.
But Davis wasn't traded, and now the Celtics have become the favorites to get the superstar forward. If they do, they expect to be able to pair him with Irving for years to come.
In the meantime, Boston still has aspirations of making it out of the Eastern Conference and back to the NBA Finals for the first time in almost a decade. For all of their very public issues this season, when the Celtics have played against top competition, they have looked every bit of the contender they were billed. In matchups with the Bucks, Raptors and Sixers so far this season, Boston is a combined 6-2 -- including 3-0 against Philadelphia after Boston won there Tuesday night with Irving sidelined because of a knee injury.
Toronto, meanwhile, is 5-6, and Philadelphia is a dismal 1-7.
""Good teams have clunkers, but good teams respond to those with the right effort and approach,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said after Tuesday's win in Philadelphia. ""That was a good one. ... I just thought the whole night we played the right way.""
After the Bucks (Nikola Mirotic), Raptors (Marc Gasol and Jeremy Lin) and Sixers (Tobias Harris) have made significant upgrades both prior to the NBA's trade deadline and in the buyout market, Boston is by no means a favorite to get through the Eastern Conference playoffs. But despite the Celtics failing to make a similar deadline upgrade -- instead continuing to hoard their assets for a run at Davis this summer -- they still easily have enough to remain a threat.
The Boston Celtics will be without both of their point guards -- Kyrie Irving and Terry Rozier -- in Wednesday's game against the Detroit Pistons.
They have a clear formula to win in May and June: Keep the game close until the closing minutes, and then let Irving -- arguably the best closer in the game today -- carry them home. That same formula already has provided several of those wins for the Celtics against their competitors atop the East this season.
And Tuesday's win in Philadelphia without Irving -- in which Al Horford and Hayward led Boston to the victory -- served as yet another reminder that the Celtics are going to need both of those veterans to be consistently playing that way if they want to fulfill their ambitions and reach the NBA Finals.
The Celtics will now take a week to rest and recharge before returning from the break for a showdown with the East-leading Bucks in Milwaukee to begin their 24-game run to the playoffs. Boston has already gone through so much that it seems hard to believe that much time is left in its regular season. But, despite it all, everything the Celtics were expected to do when this season began is still possible.
Now they just have to do it.

Westbrook got the win, though, as the Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a 26-point deficit -- the largest in OKC franchise history -- to beat the Houston Rockets 117-112.
Harden had 25 points in the first half and finished with 42 on 11-of-28 shooting. It was his 21st 40-point game this season; no other player has more than seven. Harden is now two 30-point games away from tying Wilt Chamberlain for the second-longest 30-point streak in NBA history. He also is 36 games away from tying Chamberlain for the longest such streak.
Harden saw a variety of Thunder defenders, with fellow MVP candidate Paul George (45 points on 12-of-22 shooting) taking the bulk of the load.
""It was a pretty good matchup against Harden,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It was pretty fun, until they beat us.""
Westbrook finished with 21 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists, as well as the game-winning bucket and game-winning stop. With 30 seconds left, he knifed through a double-team and finished an uncontested layup to put the Thunder up one.
""Actually, I'd been seeing it all game,"" Westbrook said, ""so just waiting on the right time to use it.""
Westbrook has 22 triple-doubles this season, and for a third straight campaign, he is averaging a triple-double. Two seasons ago, he became the first player since Oscar Robertson in 1962 to average a triple-double and the second ever to do it.
""It's not even surprising no more,"" Thunder guard Terrance Ferguson said of Westbrook. ""I see him do it all the time, and the type of player he is, it's so easy for him. You don't even notice it, but it's there. He gets everybody involved, he's a great leader, so to see nine straight triple-doubles -- what, is that like a record or something?""
On Thursday, Westbrook passed both Michael Jordan and his own previous mark with eight straight triple-doubles, the longest streak since Chamberlain had nine straight in 1968. He tied Chamberlain's standard on Saturday. Westbrook can stand alone with the longest triple-double streak in NBA history on Monday at home against the Portland Trail Blazers.
