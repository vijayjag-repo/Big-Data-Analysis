25999217,"ESPN's Ramona Shelburne reported Wednesday that Morris was picking between the Thunder, Lakers, Rockets and Raptors, among a few other interested teams.
Russell Westbrook says he doesn't pay critics any mind -- and never has. ""I've been blessed with the talent to not give a f---,"" Westbrook said. ""And I don't, regardless of what happens.""
The Athletic first reported the agreement.
Morris, 29, recently was traded by the Wizards to the Pelicans, and then was waived by New Orleans. He last played on Dec. 26 after suffering a neck injury. He recently was cleared to play after receiving a second opinion.
After waiving guard Alex Abrines last week, the Thunder had three roster spots open and have filled them with two 10-day contracts (Richard Solomon and Scotty Hopson) and now Morris.
With financial constraints playing a part because of a significant luxury tax bill pending, the Thunder didn't make a deal at the trade deadline, instead hoping to make an addition in the buyout market. Morris will provide versatility to the Thunder's bench, backing up starting power forward Jerami Grant and providing another floor-spacing big in addition to Patrick Patterson.
A 6-foot-10 forward, Morris is averaging 11.5 points, 5.1 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 34 games this season (15 starts).

25961731,"All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving left the Celtics' game Saturday night against the LA Clippers in Boston with a right knee sprain and did not return.
Things unraveled for the Celtics both on the court and off it afterward.
The Celtics were in control of the game when Irving hurt his knee with about five minutes left in the second quarter while attempting to defend Garrett Temple at the top of the key.
The Clippers outscored the Celtics 75-44 after Irving left, coming back from 28 points down to win 123-112.
Celtics president Danny Ainge said the team's ""engagement"" to star guard Kyrie Irving remains intact, and he believes they will exchange vows and ""get married"" on July 1.
The two storied franchises have battled for championships through the decades. With the backdrop of a thrilling finish Thursday night, their next battle will come this summer as both teams try to land the coveted Pelicans star.
It was the largest comeback in the NBA in the past two seasons and the largest in Clippers history. It was the biggest blown lead by the Celtics since Dec. 5, 2003. And it came two nights after Boston gave up an 18-point lead to the Los Angeles Lakers at TD Garden.
Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Irving's knee appeared to ""buckle"" in the second quarter and that the 26-year-old will undergo more tests on Sunday.
But Stevens said the injury wasn't to blame for his team's collapse.
""There's no excuses,"" Stevens told NBC Sports Boston. ""Those things happen and we all have to pick up for that. So, I'll go back and figure out what I can do better, what we can do better, and we'll go from there.""
Boston's Marcus Morris wasn't as measured in his comments afterward.
The veteran forward blamed the loss on the team's lack of cohesion, calling the Celtics' effort ""unacceptable"" and saying Boston hasn't had fun while playing in a long time.
""I mean, for me, it's not really about the loss,"" Morris said. ""It's about the attitude that we're playing with. Guys are hanging their head. It's just not fun, it's not fun. We're not competing at a high level. Even when we're winning it's still not fun. I just don't see the joy in the game.
""I watch all these other teams in the league, guys up on the bench, up on the court; they're doing stuff that looks like they're enjoying their teammate's success, they're enjoying everything and they're playing together. And when I look at us, I just see a bunch of individuals.""
Morris said there are no more excuses with the trade deadline behind them.
""For us to be a championship team, man, this s--- has to change,"" he said. ""We have to genuinely want to win. That has to be the first goal. Whatever it takes, I'm with it. If you want to take me out the lineup and get some juice in it, I'm with it. But I'm trying to win. That's the goal. Trade deadline's over. This is the team we're rocking with. This is what we're going with. So, at the end of the day, man -- it's unacceptable what we did tonight. It's unacceptable for what we did with a team of our caliber.""

25940969,"The Houston Rockets have acquired guard Iman Shumpert in a three-way deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Sacramento Kings.
The Rockets sent guard Brandon Knight, forward Marquese Chriss, a 2019 lottery-protected first-round pick and a 2022 second-round pick to the Cavaliers. The Cavaliers, who announced the trade on Thursday, sent guard Alec Burks to the Kings and guards Nik Stauskas and Wade Baldwin and a 2021 second-round pick (via Milwaukee) to the Rockets. The Kings will also get the Rockets' 2020 second-round pick.
With three teams trading six players and two draft picks, Kevin Pelton grades the move.
Stauskas and Baldwin were acquired in a deal with Portland on Sunday that sent Rodney Hood to the Trail Blazers.
Shumpert, 28, has had a strong season for the resurgent Kings, averaging 8.9 points, 3.1 rebounds and 2.2 assists. He is expected to play a significant bench role for the Rockets in their Western Conference playoff push.
Rockets point guard Chris Paul said he was excited about adding Shumpert's defensive mentality to the team.
""I've known Shump for a while, man,"" Paul said. ""He's scrappy. He gets after it. And somebody like that, I can play with any day of the week.""
James Harden echoed Paul's excitement over the addition of Shumpert and praised the Rockets for being active before the trade deadline.

25974152,"CHICAGO -- Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry has been fined $25,000 for his comments regarding Pelicans star Anthony Davis, a source with knowledge of the situation told ESPN.
Davis, who requested to be traded from the Pelicans, listed Milwaukee as a preferred landing spot on his revised list of teams he would like to play for.
""I saw that report, and I think it's great,"" Lasry told Sporting News. ""It's a little bit of what we want. We want players to come and play in Milwaukee. And part of it is, when you're winning and you're setting a standard for excellence, people see that. People want to win.""
He continued: ""We hope it would be players like Anthony Davis and others who want to come to Milwaukee.""
An NBA spokesman told ESPN on Monday that the league is looking into whether any contact took place between Ben Simmons and the Lakers that violated NBA rules.
The Los Angeles Lakers, Clippers and New York Knicks also were on Davis' list of preferred teams.
Lasry's comments violated league tampering rules that prohibit team representatives from commenting on other teams' players, especially in an effort to openly and publicly recruit.
Lasry is not the first person to run afoul of the NBA's anti-tampering guidelines in recent years. The Lakers were fined $500,000 for showing ""a prohibited expression of interest"" in Paul George when he played for the Indiana Pacers. The team also was fined $50,000 when Magic Johnson publicly praised Giannis Antetokounmpo in June.
Davis, who is set to be a free agent in 2020, will play the rest of the season with the Pelicans after New Orleans decided not to trade the All-Star before last Thursday's deadline.

25954077,"There have been two behind-the-scenes dramas happening with Anthony Davis over the past week.
One was his trade demand from the New Orleans Pelicans. The other was what would happen in the event the Pelicans didn't trade him, which looked more likely by the day. Would New Orleans continue to play Davis or make him a healthy scratch for the rest of the season, as they did for several games before Thursday's trade deadline?
Met with boos and cheers in his return to the Pelicans' lineup Friday in New Orleans, Anthony Davis said he was surprised by the jeers but was ""just happy to be back on the floor playing the game that I love.""
The two storied franchises have battled for championships through the decades. With the backdrop of a thrilling finish Thursday night, their next battle will come this summer as both teams try to land the coveted Pelicans star.
Zach Lowe breaks down the teams and players on notice after a whirlwind trade deadline.
Two days before the deadline, Rich Paul, Davis' agent, called the league office and expressed concern that the Pelicans wouldn't play Davis if he weren't traded, sources told ESPN. Paul told the league that Davis wanted to play.
Given that a possible injury could affect future trade value and perhaps improve draft positions, there was a growing expectation that the Pelicans might put Davis on ice for the last 27 games of the season.
The Pelicans, as they dealt with the Davis situation and other matters around the trade deadline (they made two deals), put the final decision off. At the time, there were some voices within the organization supporting the option to not play him, sources said.
After reviewing its rules, the league office informed the Pelicans that they would be expected to play Davis, starting with Friday night's nationally televised game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, sources said.
The league referred the Pelicans to rules put in place in 2017 that restrict teams from resting healthy players. The Pelicans, league sources said, were told that they would be subject to a fine of $100,000 per every game if Davis were benched.
Davis was fined $50,000 last week for breaking league rules when Paul publicly made a trade demand, the largest fine permitted.
Ryen Russillo breaks down the Pelicans' decision to not play Anthony Davis in back-to-back games or in the 4th quarter of their game vs. the Timberwolves.
After the trade deadline passed with Davis remaining on the team, the Pelicans requested a meeting with Davis to discuss the rest of the season. In that meeting, Davis told the Pelicans that he wanted to return to the floor -- he recently missed three weeks with a finger injury -- and play in as many games as possible.
The Pelicans knew they would likely lose in arbitration if they benched Davis. But there was an option of drastically reducing his playing time. After discussions, the team decided it would act ""ethically"" and return Davis to his previous role as starter and centerpiece of the team, sources said. They also want to follow league rules.
Although it might cost them draft position -- the Pelicans are 21-21 when Davis plays and 4-10 when he doesn't this season -- and risk injury, the team wanted to respect Davis' wishes, sources said.
Davis and the team agreed that he would not play in back-to-backs -- likely starting with Saturday's game in Memphis after he had 32 points and 9 rebounds in 25 minutes in Friday's 122-117 win -- and that his minutes would possibly be reduced. An agreement was reached that Davis will consult with the team on which ends of back-to-backs he will play in the rest of the season, sources said.
Ultimately, the understanding avoided a standoff that might've dragged into next weekend's All-Star Game, in which Davis will be representing the Pelicans.

25954130,"Los Angeles Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka, with all due respect to local football fans following the Rams' Super Bowl defeat, thinks his team has some similarities to the NFL champion New England Patriots.
""I think early on they were facing a ton of adversity,"" Pelinka said on a conference call with reporters Friday to discuss his team's NBA trade deadline deals. ""There were lots of stories being told about fractured relationships, but what did they do? They kind of came together. ...
""My hope is our story is a little bit, maybe, like that where we're on the outside but we find a way to get in the playoffs with the skill sets we've added. And then much like [Tom] Brady did, we let one of the all-time greats -- LeBron [James] -- take the helm for this team and make some noise.""
Which players and picks are on the move? We have a rundown of the latest deals.
The Los Angeles Lakers traded Michael Beasley and Ivica Zubac to the LA Clippers in return for Mike Muscala.
LeBron James selected Warriors star Kevin Durant with the first pick of Thursday's All-Star draft, while Giannis Antetokounmpo -- the captain of the team opposing James' side -- selected Golden State guard Stephen Curry with his.
The Pats started the season 1-2 and had a two-game losing streak in December to drop to 9-5, causing some to question whether it was the beginning of the end of their dynasty. Then New England rallied to win its sixth Lombardi Trophy.
The Lakers are 28-27, holding the No. 10 spot in the Western Conference, only three games behind the No. 6 Utah Jazz.
L.A. attempted to overhaul its roster this week by offering a robust package of players and picks to the Pelicans, hoping to pry superstar Anthony Davis from New Orleans. The Pelicans resisted, leaving the Lakers to settle for two minor moves: sending Svi Mykhailiuk to the Detroit Pistons for sharpshooter Reggie Bullock on Tuesday and trading Michael Beasley and Ivica Zubac to the Clippers on Thursday for floor-spacing big man Mike Muscala.
The Clippers' deal opened a roster spot, and Pelinka said the team is evaluating ""a handful"" of players to fill it -- either now or closer to the March 1 deadline to add a player and have him be playoff eligible.
Continuing the Patriots' parallel, Pelinka compared Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman to the players the Lakers added, noting how New England found its rhythm after the slot receiver returned from a four-game suspension, much the same way he hopes the Lakers find their stride now.
""I almost look at Bullock and Muscala, my hope is, much like Edelman was,"" he said. ""It's just one player, but that can have such a big impact on overall chemistry, and I hope those two guys can come in and have that impact.""
The two newcomers fit more into the shooter-specialist mold -- much like the players who surrounded James in Cleveland -- than the playmakers on the roster Pelinka and Lakers president Magic Johnson built in the offseason. But the GM refuted the notion that this week's moves were made to correct personnel mistakes made in the summer.
""I don't think there's been a shift at all. Our identity's still playmakers,"" Pelinka said. ""... I think it's probably just a tweak on it, given the circumstances -- the unexpected circumstances that we don't control that came up. I think it's a smart response to the events that unfolded and we're excited to see how it works.""
Pelinka dubbed James, who missed 18 games because of a groin injury, and Rajon Rondo, who has missed 34 games for various reasons, the Lakers' ""engine drivers,"" and their absences caused a change of course.
Then again, the Lakers would have been navigating an entirely different map had they acquired Davis.
Citing league tampering rules, Pelinka would not address specific talks with New Orleans but provided L.A.'s perspective when targeting deals.
""The thing I've learned in negotiating is you can only control your own tenor and your own discussions on your side,"" he said. ""And try to approach everything to be smartly aggressive and treat every negotiation with dignity and professionalism. And I think in general, around the league, that's what you get.
""These teams are all represented by really smart, really good general managers. And I think the negotiations in general have that spirit and that feel, and that's the expectation of all the teams. In terms of is there a jealousy because of the Lakers' success over the years, or because of perceived advantage because of the city that we're in, that's probably a better question for you to ask the other teams. I'd rather not sit in a seat of judgment on what other people might think.""
The trade speculation took its toll, culminating in an embarrassing 42-point loss to the Indiana Pacers prior to the deadline. Pelinka confirmed a Los Angeles Times report that detailed Johnson's plan to meet the team in Philadelphia -- Pelinka said Johnson is attending a reunion celebrating Michigan State's 1979 NCAA championship as he makes his way west to east. The Times said Johnson will have an open forum for Lakers players to address any unrest that might exist within the team stemming from the trade deadline.
Johnson expressed his own dissatisfaction to Lakers coach Luke Walton after L.A.'s 2-5 start to the season. Pelinka endorsed Walton for how he has handled the season since.
""I think Luke has done a great job of battling through some of the circumstances we've faced as a team with the injuries this year, holding things together,"" Pelinka said. ""I think Luke's the leader. I think he has done a really good job.""
This is a critical juncture in the season. Will Thursday's thrilling buzzer-beating win over the rival Boston Celtics be the spark that gets the Lakers back on track, or was it a temporary respite from all the noise that will certainly resurface if the team struggles and the conversation shifts from trade deadline deals to offseason maneuvers and free-agency targets?
""I think when you go through anything as a team, if you go through adversity, you can choose how to respond,"" Pelinka said. ""Does it draw you closer together or does it push you further apart?""

25933114,"Few in the league can remember anything like this Anthony Davis saga -- the posturing, the ticking clock, the quirky rule banning one suitor (Boston Celtics) from getting in the action now, the uncertainty surrounding almost everything except that Davis is worth all of it, the tentacles touching so many franchises. It is, in a literal sense, one of the very biggest stories in the history of the NBA.
At the center of it are three players who do not even play for either Davis' current team or the Lakers -- the suitor of choice for Davis and his agent, Rich Paul: Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving and, perhaps of a bit less immediate importance, Zion Williamson. If acquiring Davis is even possible for the Lakers ahead of Thursday's deadline, it is in large part because of those three names, directly and indirectly.
Tatum is the most valuable NBA player who has been credibly linked to the Davis trade sweepstakes. He is better today than Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, or Kyle Kuzma, with more upside. He is worth waiting on.
Whether the Celtics have explicitly told Dell Demps, the New Orleans Pelicans' GM, that they would be willing to include Tatum in a trade for Davis they can't actually pull off for almost five months is perhaps the diciest and most uncomfortable question in this whole affair.
They ""have promised to be aggressive with their wealth of draft and player assets to try to acquire Davis,"" per a report by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Sam Amick of The Athletic reported Tuesday that Tatum ""has been discussed extensively by the two teams and is expected to be a major part of the talks when June rolls around."" But that is different than Boston promising clearly and explicitly to trade Tatum for Davis, and I am not sure they have been that explicit -- nor have I seen any published reporting indicating they have.
Maybe they've implied it so strongly that there is almost no difference between what they have said and actually verbalizing the exact words, ""Yes, you can have Tatum in July."" Maybe the distinction doesn't matter. But there is a distinction.
Maybe the distinction is impossible to eliminate. This is unprecedented -- teams almost pre-negotiating a trade five months before they can execute it. Think of everything that could happen between now and then. Tatum could get hurt. Davis could get hurt. Toronto could sweep Boston in the second round, and shove Irving further out the door into free agency.
Boston could plausibly tell Demps: We can't guarantee to offer Tatum now because he could suffer some unknown injury, and a dozen other variables could flip a dozen ways. They also have morale issues to consider -- the consequences of someone reporting that any specific Boston player has already been offered to New Orleans. Speculation about the general outlines of a plausible offer is one thing. Seeing your name in print as having been specifically offered might be another for some players.
Danny Ainge, Boston's GM, might want to seek permission to talk to Davis before he promises Tatum. Demps could nod and understand. He could also say, OK, let's assume you get to the conference finals, Tatum stays healthy, and everything else is normal or at least normal by NBA standards.

Zach and ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz pick their most intriguing trade deadline teams (22:13), dissect the Kristaps Porzingis deal (3:00), and much more.
Who are the players and teams to watch as the trade deadline nears? Zach Lowe bounces around the league.
What does Boston say to that? Is the question even worth asking?
You could argue there is no way Boston can deliver a definitive ""yes"" on Tatum's availability today and know with 100 percent certainty that they could hold to that definitive ""yes"" in July, or that the Pelicans would even care about it by then. You could also argue if Boston stops short of that definitive ""yes,"" they are trying to live in a gray area -- to have plausible deniability in every direction -- and risk having Demps shrug and deal Davis to the Lakers before Thursday's deadline. Both arguments could be right.
The Lakers would appear to have very little leverage. Their young players have not exactly lit the world on fire, with or without LeBron, and the whole team surrendered in Indiana on Tuesday night with a lethargy eerily reminiscent of last season's pre-trade-deadline Cavaliers. The Pelicans have time, and they might have other suitors -- win-now teams willing to go all-in on Davis; teams willing to deal for him now and flip him for more later; and a new potential suitor in the Clippers, having loaded up on draft picks in Wednesday morning's Tobias Harris deal with Philadelphia.
(It's unclear if the Clippers can get in the Davis race now, or if the Pelicans consider Shai Gilgeous-Alexander a good-enough centerpiece for a deal at some point. They could still try in the summer if the Lakers don't get Davis now. The Clippers could build a competitive package around Gilgeous-Alexander, Montrezl Harrell and three or four first-round picks. They do fear the embarrassment of dealing their best stuff for Davis only to watch him walk across the Staples Center hallway in a year -- even if they are on Davis' list of teams to which he would sign an extension.)
And there is this basic reality the Lakers are trying to overcome -- the fundamental truth they must insist is just a little untrue: The best offer the Lakers dangle on Thursday will still be there on July 1. They must push back on that. They must give the Pelicans some reason to doubt the sky is blue.
Irving might have inadvertently given them the teensiest opening. Last Friday, he expressed uncertainty over whether he will re-sign in Boston. The Lakers can grab hold of that, and present New Orleans a doomsday scenario that vaporizes Boston's trump-everything Tatum-centric offer before the Celtics have a chance to make it: Boston underperforms in the postseason, Irving telegraphs his intention to leave early -- like around the draft -- and Boston concludes it cannot deal Tatum without any confidence that Irving would be around to play with Davis.
That is what the Lakers will probably say, anyway: If Boston's Tatum offer goes away in July, maybe our best offer -- the one sitting in front of you right now, Dell Demps -- goes away in July, too. That is their play. Irving has helped them make it. They could stretch the same reasoning to apply to the New York Knicks: If you are waiting to see if New York wins the No. 1 pick, just know that you are passing on our best offer to see if a 14 percent wager hits. None of the other teams in the running for the top pick -- Cleveland, Phoenix, Chicago, Atlanta -- would seem to have the wherewithal to trade Williamson for a Davis rental. Some would-be suitors place great value on what Davis would bring them for the remainder of this season; the Lakers could argue the offers would decline or vanish in the offseason.
Boston would surely counter that the greater the uncertainty surrounding Irving, the greater their urgency to get Davis. Will Irving really tell Boston he's for sure out until he sees whether they can acquire Davis on July 1 -- or agree to a deal for Davis before then?
Perhaps not. Irving has been hard to read. Obviously, his public posture toward the Celtics has changed since declaring at a season-ticket-holder event in the fall he planned to re-sign in Boston. It may be unwise for New Orleans to expect clarity from Irving before he puts pen to paper somewhere, or before the Davis situation is resolved.
(Boston, for its part, remains cautiously optimistic about keeping Irving, though the events of the past week -- Irving's comments, New York opening up a second maximum salary slot -- have shaken them. But Boston is always confident. That is Ainge's default mindset. The league at large is much less confident, but it is hard to say who knows what, and with what level of reliability. The postseason could be really telling for so many of this summer's headliner free agents.)
And that is why what happens, or doesn't happen, on Thursday may hinge on the simplest question: How much do Demps and the rest of the Pelicans brain trust like Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart (whom the Lakers prefer to keep) and whatever draft picks L.A. has on the table when it is go time?
Maybe that ends up being two first-rounders -- where the Lakers reportedly topped out before talks splintered on Tuesday -- and a couple of extra second-rounders. Maybe New Orleans can coax an extra unprotected first-rounder out of Los Angeles if and when talks resume. The Clippers gave them a tick more leverage today.
You can scoff at the value of any future first-round picks -- 2021, 2023, 2025, whatever -- coming from the team with LeBron and prime Anthony Davis. You might be right. But LeBron is already 34, with 55,000 career minutes under his belt. Davis is in his prime now, and his team has made the playoffs twice. Sure, health issues explain a lot of that futility. Every team suffers health issues to varying degrees every season. Injuries aren't some anomaly.

Three unprotected picks is a haul, almost no matter what. Toss in one extra pick swap, and you have a bounty. (Remember: The league in late 2017 was kicking around the idea of straight-up banning pick swaps in the years between drafts in which one team owed picks to the same rival, sources have told ESPN.)
Boston can of course offer just as many picks, and probably more. They own a bunch of extra picks from other teams. They also have good young players beyond Tatum in Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Terry Rozier (though he's headed to free agency, and thus tricky to deal in July), and even Robert Williams.
Boston might contend it can build a better offer than the Lakers' without including Tatum: everything but Tatum. Take it all: Brown, Smart, the Kings pick, the Grizzlies pick, the Clippers pick, Lucky the Leprechaun's dumb hat, whatever else you want aside from Tatum.
Even if Ainge never promises to trade Tatum before the deadline, Demps must know that whatever the best version of the ""everything but Tatum"" offer is on July 1 will be available to him then.
The Pelicans have to decide whether that offer is better than whatever the Lakers offer on Thursday. Without Tatum, it's at least an argument. Even skeptics of Ball, Ingram and Kuzma would concede that -- even if no single L.A. pick has the upside of the Grizzlies pick Boston owns (top-eight protected this season, top-six next season, unprotected in 2021).
It's a conversation -- if Demps is on the high side when it comes to Ball, Ingram and Kuzma. There are human dynamics here. No front office or ownership group likes to live in a circus for months. The situation in New Orleans if the Pelicans stand pat would be uncomfortable whether Davis plays, or the Pelicans send him away. The league changes every day. There is value in knowing that I can, for sure, have this thing that is sitting in my hand right now. Maybe it's not Tatum, or Williamson, but it's still good, and I have it, and I know it, and I can just get this over with, and begin planning my team's future right away.
From the outside, of course the Pelicans should wait. Waiting brings the possibility of Tatum. It brings clarity with New York's draft position, and on the Clippers' around the draft and July 1. The Lakers aren't going to play hard ball and take Ingram or Kuzma or whomever off the table in July. Come on. They don't want to wait until the summer of 2020 to sign Davis in free agency, because doing that could require keeping cap space open -- and possibly going through LeBron's age-35 season in 2019-20 with another makeshift temporary roster. They may not be the frontrunner for any of this summer's star free agents -- not one.
From the inside of these things, it's messy and emotional. People in Demps' position worry about their job security: Will I even be there to make this deal in July? Is this trade the way I save my job?
On the flip side, there may be some within the Pelicans brain trust who will simply refuse, out of spite, to deal Davis to the Lakers now.
The smart money remains on the Pelicans waiting. It always has been. But that doesn't mean it's an easy, simple decision.

25935086,"PHILADELPHIA -- Kyle Lowry has no desire to play for anyone but the Toronto Raptors. But if the All-Star guard is sent elsewhere between now and the NBA's Thursday trade deadline, Lowry said he'll have no hard feelings toward the team he has played for over the past six-plus seasons.
""I think they will make decisions for themselves, and they'll do what's best for them,"" Lowry told ESPN after scoring 20 points to go with six assists and two steals in a 119-107 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday. ""I don't think there's one thing I can say or do [to change that], you know what I mean?
Our experts give six deals that work, including 10 teams and multiple contenders.
Here's the latest on each team heading into Thursday's trade deadline.
""I think that's just how they work, and they operate. They make moves, and they make moves for the best of the organization. If they do something, that will be their feeling to whatever the organization thinks is best for them.""
Lowry has been discussed as a piece in a potential deal with the Memphis Grizzlies, sources confirmed to ESPN. He admitted he was surprised that his name had come up at all, and that he hasn't been contacted by anyone in Toronto's front office about a potential deal.
""No, I haven't heard anything,"" Lowry said. ""Reassurance would be great, but at the end of the day, they don't have to call me. My job is, as a player, to go out here and do my job. If they want to call me, that'd be great. I would appreciate it. But if they don't, I understand.
""It's a business. I know that's such a cliche, but if they wanted to call me, I'm sure they would. I've been here six years, and I've given a lot to this organization. I'm sure if they were going to trade me, they'd say, 'Hey, Kyle, this is what's on the table.'""
Lowry, who was selected to his fifth straight All-Star team last week, is in the second year of a three-year, $100 million deal he signed last summer.
In an interview with ESPN's Rachel Nichols in December, Lowry said of his relationship with Raptors president of basketball operations Masai Ujiri, ""He's the president of basketball operations, and that's it. For me, I come here and do my job. ... That's where we stand.""
And while Lowry may not hold any ill will toward Ujiri for his name coming up in trade talks now, he said things are no different today than they were when he said that two months ago.
""It's the truth, right? At the end of the day I said nothing that wasn't true,"" Lowry said. ""That's how I look at it. The relationship has always been the same. It's been the same since I got here.
""Years ago, he challenged me to be a better basketball player. ... That was his challenge. We haven't been 'Rah-rah, buddy-buddy.' ... I keep a small circle, and that's how I work, and how I operate. So, for me, it's one of those things where I stay in my lane.""
Tuesday's win left the Raptors with a 39-16 record, leaving them 1.5 games behind the Milwaukee Bucks for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. Toronto has managed to do that despite having its full roster available for just two games all season -- wins in Phoenix on Nov. 2, and in Utah on Nov. 5.
That should change Thursday, when Jonas Valanciunas is set to return a little less than two months after dislocating his thumb against the Golden State Warriors. At least that will be the case if the Raptors choose to stand pat at the deadline.
The Raptors have had Lowry and Kawhi Leonard on the court together in only 29 of those 55 games this season after Tuesday's win -- including just eight of Toronto's past 27 contests. Lowry said that, once healthy, Toronto has enough to make a run at getting out of the East and to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.
""I think we're really good,"" he said. ""I think we're really talented. I think once we get healthy, we're a really dominant team. I think at the beginning of the season we showed what we can do, we just have to continue to grow and get healthy. That's the biggest thing. Being healthy and being on the same page.""
And, despite not hearing from the front office, Lowry says he's on the same page with them, too.
""No, not at all,"" he said, when asked if he was upset he hadn't heard from them about a possible deal. ""It is what it is. If they call, they call.
""If they don't, I understand.""

25931300,"Already done for this season after one operation, Wizards point guard John Wall now will miss most -- if not all -- of next season, too, because he needs surgery on his left Achilles tendon, which he tore in a fall at home.
Wizards team doctor Wiemi Douoguih said Tuesday in a conference call with reporters that he discovered the partial rupture of the tendon during a procedure done Monday to address an infection from the operation on Wall's left heel on Jan. 8.
The 28-year-old Wall's Achilles surgery has not been scheduled yet. Douoguih said it probably will be next week.
Despite being without star point guard John Wall and going through a pair of 2-9 stretches, Wizards owner Ted Leonsis said Washington is still making a run for the playoffs, and that the idea of tanking is ""offensive.""
Here's the latest on each team heading into Thursday's trade deadline.
Wall, whose game is built around his speed and ability to drive to the basket, is expected to be able to return to what the team called ""full basketball activities"" about a year after that operation. Douoguih estimated the recovery range for Wall's injury, ""at John's age,"" to be from 11 to 15 months.
There is no way to know what sort of player Wall will be when he returns, Douoguih said.
""Unfortunately,"" he added, ""we don't have a lot of data on elite NBA point guards with tendon ruptures.""
Douoguih said Wall was not wearing his walking boot -- which is OK while at home -- when he slipped and tumbled on Jan. 29.
""He never heard a pop,"" Douoguih said. ""He had a slight increase in discomfort.""
So the Achilles problem wasn't known until Monday.
Wall, who is making $19.2 million this season, is signed through the 2022-23 season. He will make $38.2 million next season, $41.2 million in 2020-21, $44.3 million in 2021-22 and $47.3 million in 2022-23.
He was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 NBA draft out of Kentucky and was an All-Star each of the past five seasons. But a series of injuries will have robbed him of much of what usually are a player's prime years.
He played in only 41 games last season, when he had an operation on his left knee. Wall also had surgery on both knees in 2016.
John Wall's body is starting to take a toll on him, as the Wizards guard has suffered a number of injuries to his lower body in recent seasons.
Golden State Warriors center DeMarcus Cousins, who recently returned from a torn left Achilles after almost a year of rehab, said Tuesday that he's spoken to Wall and offered him some advice.
""I talked to him this morning,"" Cousins said after practice. ""It sucks. It's unfortunate. But me knowing John as long as I do, I know he'll overcome this. There's no doubt in my mind about that. He's overcome a lot of hard obstacles in his life and prepare to just add this to the list.""
Cousins' advice to Wall was simple.
""I basically just told him prepare for the hard days because it's a lot of them,"" Cousins said. ""Through it all, just try to make sure you better yourself each day. And once that day's behind you, just move on to the next, regardless of the result. That was my advice. Like I said, there's no doubt in my mind he'll overcome this.""
The news might change the way the club approaches Thursday's trade deadline, because while this season was basically a throwaway after injuries to Wall, Dwight Howard and Markieff Morris, the uncertainty surrounding the point guard for next season makes the franchise's future even harder to assess.
Even though the team has been without Wall for 18 games, during which the Wizards have gone 9-9, owner Ted Leonsis insisted last week that he expects Washington to make a run for a playoff spot.
""You have to go to the players, the coach, the staff and say, 'Do we have enough to make the playoffs?' And to a person, I was told, 'Yes, we do,'"" Leonsis told WTOP last week.
The Wizards are 22-31 this season, sitting in 10th in the Eastern Conference, three games back of the eighth-place Miami Heat.
Washington plays at the East-leading Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night.

LeVert, 24, had appeared to be on his way to an All-Star season for the Nets, averaging 18.4 points and showing the promise of one of the conference's rising stars. The Nets are 28-26 and holding on to sixth in the Eastern Conference race and expect to get back guard Spencer Dinwiddie from a thumb injury in late February or early March.

25952582,"Phoenix, which has been seeking a guard for a while, has acquired Tyler Johnson and Wayne Ellington from the Heat in exchange for Ryan Anderson.
Zach Lowe breaks down the teams and players on notice after a whirlwind trade deadline.
Ellington is one of the top available players in the post-trade-deadline buyout market, and Detroit would score a significant recruiting victory in signing him.
The Phoenix Suns waived Ellington after acquiring him in a trade with the Miami Heat. He will be a free agent once he clears waivers this weekend.
The Pistons are selling Ellington on taking a bulk of the playing time that opened up with the trade of Reggie Bullock to the Lakers. Ellington will be on a one-year contract and the Pistons offer him a chance to showcase his talent for summer free agency.
The 31-year-old guard averaged 8.4 points in 21.3 minutes per game for the Heat this season, both slightly above his career averages.

Westbrook got the win, though, as the Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a 26-point deficit -- the largest in OKC franchise history -- to beat the Houston Rockets 117-112.
Harden had 25 points in the first half and finished with 42 on 11-of-28 shooting. It was his 21st 40-point game this season; no other player has more than seven. Harden is now two 30-point games away from tying Wilt Chamberlain for the second-longest 30-point streak in NBA history. He also is 36 games away from tying Chamberlain for the longest such streak.
Harden saw a variety of Thunder defenders, with fellow MVP candidate Paul George (45 points on 12-of-22 shooting) taking the bulk of the load.
""It was a pretty good matchup against Harden,"" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said. ""It was pretty fun, until they beat us.""
Westbrook finished with 21 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists, as well as the game-winning bucket and game-winning stop. With 30 seconds left, he knifed through a double-team and finished an uncontested layup to put the Thunder up one.
""Actually, I'd been seeing it all game,"" Westbrook said, ""so just waiting on the right time to use it.""
Westbrook has 22 triple-doubles this season, and for a third straight campaign, he is averaging a triple-double. Two seasons ago, he became the first player since Oscar Robertson in 1962 to average a triple-double and the second ever to do it.
""It's not even surprising no more,"" Thunder guard Terrance Ferguson said of Westbrook. ""I see him do it all the time, and the type of player he is, it's so easy for him. You don't even notice it, but it's there. He gets everybody involved, he's a great leader, so to see nine straight triple-doubles -- what, is that like a record or something?""
On Thursday, Westbrook passed both Michael Jordan and his own previous mark with eight straight triple-doubles, the longest streak since Chamberlain had nine straight in 1968. He tied Chamberlain's standard on Saturday. Westbrook can stand alone with the longest triple-double streak in NBA history on Monday at home against the Portland Trail Blazers.

2596752,"PHILADELPHIA -- Los Angeles Lakers president Magic Johnson said the New Orleans Pelicans operated in bad faith during negotiations with his team over a deal for superstar Anthony Davis. However, he said he isn't dwelling on the trade deadline failure and wants his players to shift their focus forward.
""We knew that basically at the end of the day, what happened, happened,"" Johnson said before the Lakers' 140-123 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday. ""And we knew that when we first started, in terms of what happened. But hey, it is what it is.""
Johnson was asked whether the New Orleans front office -- run by general manager Dell Demps and executive vice president Mickey Loomis -- acted in good faith from the time Davis' trade request became public until the deadline passed without a deal.
The two storied franchises have battled for championships through the decades. With the backdrop of a thrilling finish Thursday night, their next battle will come this summer as both teams try to land the coveted Pelicans star.
Johnson replied flatly, ""No."" But he pushed back against the notion that the public nature of the negotiations was unfair to L.A.'s young core, as players heard their names mentioned as trade chips on an almost daily basis.
""Quit making this about thinking these guys are babies because that's what you're treating them like,"" Johnson said. ""They're professionals. All of them. And this is how this league works. They know it, I know it -- that's how it goes.
""So we've got to move forward, and we are moving forward. They played outstanding against Boston. Give them credit. And we want to play well today and continue on. This is a part of the league. You've got a good side of the business that we get paid to be professional basketball players, and there's deals like this.""
Johnson also rejected the characterization that the negotiations were different than the way the rest of the league conducts its business.
""All deals are ... a lot of them are made in public,"" he said. ""We didn't make it in public, but that's part of it. That's what happens, man. We've got big boys here, and they bounce back. They're fine.""
When asked whether the way things went with New Orleans could have a hangover effect on his franchise this offseason, Johnson remained steadfast in his vision for returning the Lakers to championship form.
""That's not going to change our plans this summer,"" Johnson said. ""It's a great [free-agency] class, and we just want to get one of them.""
L.A. settled for two relatively minor moves leading up to the deadline, sending rookie Svi Mykhailiuk to the Detroit Pistons for Reggie Bullock and trading Ivica Zubac and Michael Beasley to the Los Angeles Clippers for Mike Muscala.
""We were on the phones early on,"" Johnson said, admitting that the Lakers have wanted to add shooting to their lineup for quite some time. ""Nobody was going to make a move until the last week. And we were locked into Reggie for a long time. Had some great talks with Detroit. And then finally it became a deal. Mike was really last-second when we didn't know that Philly was going to make that move [acquiring Tobias Harris from the Clippers]. When they made that move and we looked up and said, 'Man, a stretch 4-5 could really help us out.' And we feel good about the trade.""
Johnson joined the team in Philadelphia on Sunday after attending a reunion with the 1978-79 Michigan State championship team to celebrate the 40th anniversary of its title on Saturday in East Lansing, Michigan. Johnson used the trip to reconnect with his team and re-emphasize the directive for now until April: qualifying for the postseason for the first time since 2013.
""I talked to guys individually,"" Johnson said. ""Because that's important to have sidebars with them. Make sure that we're heading all in the same direction. And we are. And we got a goal ahead of us to try to make the playoffs. That's what it's all about.""
There were mixed reactions to Johnson's message in the Lakers' postgame locker room.
""I think he runs the team, and he felt the pulse of the team either throughout the trade deadline or whatever the case may be,"" LeBron James said. ""But just having him around whenever that may be is always good for the ballclub.""
""I don't know,"" Rajon Rondo said when asked about Johnson's address. ""Everyone's different. Everyone receives information different. It didn't translate to a win. I don't know.""
Kyle Kuzma said it was the first time he'd heard from Lakers management from the weeks leading up to the trade deadline or since it passed.
""We just hashed it out,"" Kuzma said. ""I mean, any time Magic Johnson, one of the greatest players in the game, comes to talk to you, you're always going to be all eyes and ears. Optimistic. That's just what Magic is. He's a guy that when he walks into the room, [it] kind of electrifies. It's just who he is. You listen to what he says.""
Lakers center JaVale McGee was asked how Johnson's presence made him feel.
""I felt good,"" McGee said. ""How am I supposed to answer that? How did I feel? Tingly inside? I don't know.""
The Sixers' trades for Harris, Boban Marjanovic, James Ennis III, Mike Scott and Jonathan Simmons were examples of how ""stacked"" the Eastern Conference has become, according to Johnson. While openly pondering how the East bracket could play out, Johnson said he is ""excited"" thinking about his team being part of the postseason.
""I don't want them focused on this other stuff,"" he said. ""What happened, whose name was mentioned, all that -- that's over with. That was Thursday. This is now. Everybody got to buckle up, and we've got to move forward.""
With the high-stakes nature of playing in the NBA, let alone playing for the Lakers, an organization that holds itself to a championship standard, Johnson said trade talks will only continue to surround his team.
""Listen, we get paid to do a job,"" he said. ""And we're all professionals. I've been in this league for 40 years. A lot of players got traded on Thursday and Wednesday. Guess what's going to happen next year? A lot of players are going to get traded. A lot of players will stay home. And I talked to our guys, they're in a good place. That's all that matters. We're heading toward, hopefully, getting into the playoffs. And so, that's a part of it -- a part of NFL, a part of NHL, a part of Major League Baseball, a part of the NBA.""
Johnson was also asked about Sixers second-year star Ben Simmons, who as a 6-foot-10 point guard has drawn comparisons to the 6-foot-9 Johnson, who won five rings playing point guard for the Lakers.
""[Simmons] reached out to me, not to me directly, to the Lakers to find out if we can get together this summer,"" Johnson said. ""I said, 'Hey, you got to clear it with the league,' and if everybody -- the Sixers sign off, we sign off, the league sign off -- fine, I will do that. But if everybody doesn't sign off, then we can't get together.
""But I love his game. I love his vision. I love also, too, he's very, in terms of basketball IQ, very high basketball IQ.""
After the win over the Lakers, Simmons said he isn't focused on speaking to Johnson ""right now,"" but he touched on why that conversation could be beneficial.
""He's been in multiple situations where he's had to play the 5, and he won a championship that way, and just a Hall of Famer, one of those guys who is in the position I'm in ... I think he can help,"" Simmons said.
When asked about Johnson's comments on Simmons, a team spokesman for the Sixers declined comment to ESPN.

During the Wizards' game Monday against the Pistons, Beal picked up his dribble near the free throw line and took what looked like three steps. He then bobbled the ball under the basket and took a couple more before passing. No call was made.
After the game, Beal appeared to poke fun at himself by tweeting ""look clean to me"" with some laughing emojis.
After the clip made the rounds Tuesday morning, the National Basketball Referees Association tweeted a response.
The offensive player gathers with his right foot on the ground. He then takes two legal steps, before losing control of the ball. After regaining possession, a player is allowed to regain his pivot foot and pass or shoot prior to that foot returning to the ground. This is legal. https://t.co/0hVqgHw3w7
Beal got a kick out of that too.
😁 https://t.co/zM3oB6Lqt5
The refs appear to have gathered that their explanation wasn't really calming the furor, so they doubled down.
Fumble = legal, and no travel. No fumble = travel. It's understandable for people to think that the offensive player doesn't lose control, and therefore travels. But the officials on the floor deemed it a fumble, and therefore legal. This is what makes this job so difficult. pic.twitter.com/81igLXM9MG

25925596,"DALLAS -- Like a defender playing the passing lane, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban pounced to intercept a question intended for Kristaps Porzingis on Monday during an introductory news conference for the four players Dallas acquired in the blockbuster trade with the New York Knicks.
The inquiry was about whether Porzingis, the 7-foot-3 centerpiece of the trade, plans to sign a long-term deal with the Mavericks when he enters restricted free agency this summer.
""I can answer that for you,"" Cuban said. ""Yeah, he does.""
Three days after he was traded from the Knicks to the Mavericks, All-Star big man Kristaps Porzingis suggested in an Instagram post that his ex-team's fans should ""stay woke.""
Porzingis, 23, responded with a laugh. Asked for confirmation, he said, ""We're on the same page. Don't even ask.""
The Mavs made the trade with the belief that Porzingis and 19-year-old rookie sensation Luka Doncic could develop together into the pillars of a perennial championship contender. With Doncic watching from the back of the room, Porzingis expressed excitement about forming a long-term partnership with a playmaker he has been friends with since they were both playing professionally in Spain.
""I get excited every time I think about it,"" Porzingis said. ""I really think we can be something special. I think about basketball 24/7, and I really see us being very special on the court and fun to watch, so I'm excited about it.""
The Knicks made Porzingis available in the trade market in large part due to indications from his camp that he did not envision a long-term future in New York and was willing to make a major financial sacrifice this summer to become an unrestricted free agent next offseason.
Porzingis still has the option of playing next season on a $4.5 million qualifying offer instead of accepting an offer that could be worth as much as $158 million over five years. The Mavs, however, are confident that Porzingis will play in Dallas for years to come.
""It's not a concern I have,"" Cuban told ESPN after the news conference. ""Everything so far, all the conversations so far, have been very positive. Unless it's something that we don't expect pops up, hopefully he'll be a Maverick for the next 20 years.""
The trade for Porzingis, along with shooting guard Tim Hardaway Jr., wing Courtney Lee and point guard Trey Burke, cost the Mavs future assets and immediate financial flexibility. Dallas gave up 2017 lottery pick Dennis Smith Jr., two future first-round picks and a pair of veterans with expiring contracts (DeAndre Jordan and Wesley Matthews) for a foundation piece and three veterans who will probably be rotation players, with Hardaway and Lee due a combined $31 million next season -- salary the Knicks wanted to shed.
""We're rebuilding a championship team here,"" Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said. ""That's obviously a lot of what this deal is all about.""
President of basketball operations Donnie Nelson, who negotiated the trade with the Knicks, described Porzingis and Doncic as players who ""are going to put their own signatures on their positions,"" much like Dirk Nowitzki has done in Dallas for the past two decades.
""This is one of the most exciting times, I think, that I've ever been a part of, having two young players of their caliber for our fans to watch and improve game by game,"" Nelson said.
Mavs fans will have to wait patiently to watch Porzingis play with Doncic. As Cuban told ESPN last week, the Mavs expect Porzingis to sit out the rest of the season as he continues to rehabilitate the torn ACL in his left knee that he suffered a year ago.
Porzingis said sitting out this season has always been the plan, and he will remain patient despite saying he feels ""bouncy"" and is excited to get back on the court as soon as possible. The Mavs' medical staff and team management will consult with Porzingis' camp to come up with a schedule to ramp up his basketball activity to include live practice action in the coming weeks, but barring a change of plans, he will not make his Dallas debut until the 2019-20 season opener.
""I feel great, feel great, but as I said, we're taking our time,"" Porzingis said. ""There's no rush. I've been patient this whole time, and I'm going to keep staying patient, which is one of the hardest things for me to do. We're going to make the right decisions.""
Porzingis said there has been ""a good vibe"" throughout the Mavs organization since he arrived in Dallas, which was not the case for much of his time with the Knicks, a situation he declined to discuss in any detail on Monday.
""Every relationship takes time to build,"" Porzingis said. ""... So far, so good. It's been two days here, and they welcome me with open arms, making everything as easy as possible for me just to focus on basketball and rehab and coming back strong and being at my best. That's what you look for in an organization.""

25990225,"OKLAHOMA CITY -- Russell Westbrook doesn't necessarily put blinders on to remain unaware of the criticism that follows him around. He just doesn't care about it -- or so he says, adamantly.
""I've been blessed with the talent to not give a f---,"" the Oklahoma City Thunder star said Wednesday. ""And I don't, regardless of what happens.""
Westbrook has been one of the NBA's most polarizing players since he entered the league in 2008, drawing criticism for his aggressive playing style, shot selection and cantankerous demeanor, among other things.
He also has established himself as one of the great players of all time -- and certainly one of the most unique, as a 6-foot-3 guard who is averaging a triple-double for the third consecutive season.
Michael Jordan said James Harden's streak of 30 straight 30-point games and Russell Westbrook's 10 straight triple-doubles are both impressive accomplishments -- but not as impressive as his six titles.
Russell Westbrook made history Monday night with his 10th consecutive triple-double, passing Wilt Chamberlain's mark of nine straight set in 1968.
""It doesn't change the way I live, doesn't change the way I think,"" Westbrook said of criticism. ""I have an unbelievable family, great friends, unbelievable life, unbelievable job, make a lot of money in my job. I'm extremely blessed, thankful, humble, haven't been in trouble, don't cause no problems. I'm perfectly fine. I'm living the best life. I can't complain one bit.
""He say, she say, what somebody say about me, what they say about shooting, passing, dribbling -- I don't really care. Every year it's something. They gotta make up something about me. Which is fine. It's good. One thing I always know is, if they're not talking about you, then you're not doing something right.""
This season, Westbrook has adjusted his approach to dominate the ball less and elevate teammates, which has helped push teammate Paul George into the top of the MVP conversation. Yet there has been a fixation on Westbrook's slumping shooting numbers, which include a career-low 24.4 percent from 3-point range on 4.5 attempts per game.
""I've been disengaging that conversation since, um, I started playing basketball when I was 8, about then,"" he said of paying attention to what people are saying.
Westbrook is on a historic run of triple-doubles, recording 10 straight to break Wilt Chamberlain's record set in 1968.
In 2016-17, Westbrook became the first player since Oscar Robertson in 1962 to average a triple-double. Westbrook broke Robertson's mark for triple-doubles in a season with 42 in that MVP year, and he sits only 12 away from passing Magic Johnson for second on the all-time triple-double list.
""It's the reason I have the motto of 'Why not?'"" he said. ""It's what I really believe in. It's truly what I stand by because there are many people in the world that will let someone tell them they can or cannot do something. 'Oh, that can't happen again' or 'you can't do that again' or 'you may not ever see that again.' Those words I don't use in my vocabulary -- can't, never. That doesn't work. Well, why not me? Why not be able to change and do something to change the culture, change basketball, change the way it's played. I just think differently, man.""
Known for playing with a chip on his shoulder, Westbrook pushed back on the idea that the criticism serves as extra motivation.
""No. If you do -- for what?"" he said. ""I stay even keel. The more even keel, the better. I don't need somebody to motivate me to be able to wake up and come do my job. I motivate myself to be able to be the best I can be in the world, regardless of what other people say, good or bad. People can pat me on my back every day. I'm gonna give you the same response. As you guys know, I don't change for nobody, for nothing. I do the same thing every night, and I'm gonna continue to do that.""

25977151,"Philadelphia 76ers general manager Elton Brand called Los Angeles Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson on Monday afternoon to apologize for insinuating in a radio interview that the Lakers had called -- unprompted -- to ask permission for Johnson to speak with Sixers forward Ben Simmons, league sources told ESPN.
In the interview with 97.5 The Fanatic on Monday morning, Brand said, ""[Lakers GM] Rob Pelinka called me and said that Ben wanted to talk to Hall of Famers after the season; Magic was on the list. He asked for authorization ... I said no.""
An NBA spokesman told ESPN on Monday that the league is looking into whether any contact took place between Ben Simmons and the Lakers that violated NBA rules.
Sixers GM Elton Brand said he told Lakers president Magic Johnson ""over a month ago"" that he won't sign off on Philadelphia point guard Ben Simmons working out with the Hall of Famer.
If the Lakers want to stay in the Anthony Davis sweepstakes this summer, they might need to get creative.
Brand did not mention in that interview that someone from the Sixers, at the urging of both of Simmons' brothers, had contacted Pelinka first, which is what prompted Pelinka's call to Brand.
The Lakers issued a statement later Monday that read: ""To clarify, last November the 76ers sent an email to the Lakers asking if Ben Simmons would be able to speak with Magic Johnson about his Hall of Fame playing career. After receiving the email request from the 76ers, Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka contacted 76ers General Manager Elton Brand and informed him that Magic could only do so if the 76ers gave him pre-written approval. That was the end of the matter.""
NBA spokesman Mike Bass told ESPN on Monday, ""The league office is looking into whether any contact took place between Ben Simmons and the Los Angeles Lakers that violated NBA rules.""
Brand told ESPN earlier Monday that Simmons simply wanted the Sixers to help him facilitate ""chatting with some of the game's all-time greats.""
""No issue,"" Brand told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. ""I have a great relationship with Ben and [his agent] Rich [Paul] and we expect him to be a Sixer for a long time. He has taken interest in chatting with some of the game's all-time greats and we're supportive.
""I had brief dialogue with Rob Pelinka, who I've known for a long time, but nothing is planned. Our collective focus is on making a postseason push. Again, we're not sweating this -- end of story.""
Later in the day, Brand spoke directly to Johnson to further clear the air, sources said.
Simmons and Johnson are both 6-foot-9-plus point guards. Simmons is eligible to sign his rookie contract extension with the Sixers after the season.

25966669,"Matthews told reporters that he chose to sign the Pacers because he's been assured a starting job with the team.
""That's how I view myself, and that's how this organization views me. That's big right there,"" he said, according to the Indianapolis Star.
The move was first reported following Thursday's trade deadline, but the Pacers couldn't announce it until Sunday. Matthews was waived by the Knicks after a deal that sent Kristaps Porzingis to Dallas. He cleared waivers Saturday.
Terms of the deal were not announced.
Matthews, 32, will help fill the void left by All-Star guard Victor Oladipo, who will miss the rest of this season with a ruptured quad tendon in his right knee.
Pacers coach Nate McMillan confirmed that Matthews will start.
""He didn't come here to sit on the bench,"" McMillan told reporters, according to the Star. ""That was part of it, being a starter. We felt we could bring him in as a starter.""
McMillan has coached Matthews before with the Portland Trail Blazers.
In 44 games with Dallas, Matthews made 44 starts and averaged 13.1 points, 2.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists.
Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard called Matthews a ""solid professional"" who will ""fit in well"" with Indiana.

The Magic sent forward Jonathon Simmons, a protected 2020 first-round pick (via Oklahoma City) and a 2019 second-round pick to the Sixers.
Fultz has been sidelined since Nov. 19 after being diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, a condition that affects the nerves between the neck and shoulder.
Asked when the Magic expected Fultz to play, president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman said: ""We're going to do it right, we're not going to do it fast.""

""We look forward to getting him in here, getting our arms around him, understanding everything he's dealing with and getting him through it,'' Weltman said.
Fultz's agent, Raymond Brothers, had told ESPN on Christmas Day that his client is progressing well in rehabilitation on his right shoulder and that he expects Fultz to return to the team this season.
""We want to make sure he's 100 percent and healthy when he does come back,"" Brothers said.
The point guard is averaging 8.2 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 19 games this season. He has played in only 33 games total in his two NBA seasons.
Simmons is averaging 6.9 points, 2.4 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 41 games this season.

After a flurry of trades, which teams are looking worse and which ones got stronger?
Anthony Davis is still a Pelican, but big names like Marc Gasol and Markelle Fultz are on the move. Get the latest news and analysis, including trade grades and after-the-buzzer updates.
The move freed up a roster spot for the Celtics, giving them the ability to pick up a player who gets bought out. Players must sign with a team by March 1 to be eligible for the playoffs.
Atlanta is expected to waive Bird, a second-round pick in 2017 who has not played all season because of his involvement in a domestic violence incident in September.
News of the deal was first reported by Yahoo Sports.
Bird pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and battery on a household member, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, kidnapping, and strangulation or suffocation. Last week, he was in court on two new charges stemming from the incident. Court documents show that he told his girlfriend, ""Tell anyone about this, I don't care where you are I'll find you and kill you.""
The Celtics said in a statement in September that the matter would be handled by the NBA rather than the team.
Bird's next scheduled court date is Wednesday.

25901413,"The Chicago Bulls have waived forward Carmelo Anthony, clearing the way for the 10-time All-Star to become a free agent.
Carmelo Anthony, speaking during an appearance to see friend Dwyane Wade play against the Knicks, said he hopes to play in Madison Square Garden at least one more time.
Anthony was never asked to report to the Bulls, who acquired him Jan. 22 from the Houston Rockets in a financial maneuver.
The move is part of the franchise's original plan with Anthony, which will allow him to monitor the post-trade deadline roster flux to find his next destination.
The Lakers remain a possibility to sign Anthony, but that wouldn't happen until they use their current roster to exhaust trade deadline efforts to acquire New Orleans star Anthony Davis. The Lakers would need to create an open roster spot to sign Anthony, who is a favorite of LeBron James'.
The Bulls needed a roster spot to acquire Oklahoma City's Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot and cash in a deal as a part of a Thunder money dump, sources said.
Oklahoma City will save $7.3 million toward its luxury tax bill with the unloading of Luwawu-Cabarrot to the Bulls. The Thunder's tax bill drops to $66 million.

25945881,"The Memphis Grizzlies have traded center Marc Gasol to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright, CJ Miles and a 2024 second-round draft pick.
The Grizzlies, however, kept Mike Conley after discussing deals for their franchise point guard with multiple teams.
Zach Lowe breaks down the teams and players on notice after a whirlwind trade deadline.
Who wins this big trade? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
After a flurry of trades, which teams are looking worse and which ones got stronger?
""Marc brings significant playoff experience to our team, which along with his savviness and leadership skills really helps position us for our ultimate postseason goal,"" Raptors president Masai Ujiri said Thursday night. ""We look forward to welcoming Marc to our city and team.""
Head coach Nick Nurse said he believes Gasol's experience will give the Raptors ""a settling force"" come playoff time.
""I think that there's a lot of positives with a guy like Gasol, and I think most of them come with being battle-tested,"" Nurse said. ""I think we all know that those playoffs can get wild and woolly, and he's a guy that's been through them many times.""
In a separate deal, the Raptors traded veteran center Greg Monroe and a 2021 second-round pick to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for cash considerations. The Nets then waived the 28-year-old Monroe, who averaged 4.8 points and 4.1 rebounds in 11.1 minutes per game during his first season with the Raptors.
Gasol, 34, is averaging 15.7 points, 8.6 rebounds and a career-high 4.7 assists (which ranks second among NBA centers, trailing only Nikola Jokic's 7.7). He is the Grizzlies' franchise leader in points, rebounds, blocks and field goals made.
It is a power move for Toronto, as it looks to improve its roster as it vies with Philadelphia and Milwaukee, among others, in the Eastern Conference. The 76ers and Bucks also made major moves ahead of the trade deadline, with Philly landing Tobias Harris and Milwaukee getting Nikola Mirotic.
Gasol has been with the Grizzlies for 11 seasons, which was tied with Russell Westbrook for the fourth-longest tenure with one franchise among active players. Conley is third at 12 seasons.
A three-time All-Star and the 2013 Defensive Player of the Year, Gasol has a 15 percent trade bonus that is valued at $1.28 million. The amount of his bonus (if not waived) will be applied to his $24.1 million salary.
Gasol also has a $25.6 million player option for next season.
The 7-foot Valanciunas is averaging 12.8 points and 7.2 rebounds this season. He had surgery after suffering a dislocated left thumb on Dec. 12 and has not played since. Prior to the trade, the Raptors had expected the center to return against Atlanta on Thursday night, with the team tweeting out a picture of Valanciunas with a quote from him saying, ""I'm back.""
The 26-year-old Wright, who was selected by Toronto in the first round of the 2015 draft, is averaging 6.9 points, 2.2 assists and 2.6 rebounds in 18.3 minutes of action per game this season.
Miles, 31, is averaging 5.5 points and 1.7 rebounds this season.
Valanciunas, Wright and Miles can become free agents next season. Miles ($8.7 million) and Valanciunas ($17.6 million) have player options, while Wright will become a restricted free agent and is eligible to receive a $3.6 million qualifying offer in June.
Memphis is currently $668,000 below the luxury tax threshold.
Memphis also waived forward Omri Casspi to get its roster down to the NBA limit of 15. Casspi, 30, has been sidelined with a knee injury, and his return this season wasn't guaranteed. He averaged 6.3 points in 36 games with Memphis this season.

25910476,"SAN ANTONIO -- On another batty night in San Antonio, the Spurs mascot made the play of the game.
Nothing but net.
Sporting a Batman costume -- cape and all -- The Coyote rushed the court and trapped a live bat Saturday, the second time one of the winged intruders disrupted a Spurs home game this week.
The mascot dived to capture the bat with a fishing net near the scorer's table, getting big cheers from fans, players and Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. The Coyote ended a frantic few seconds with the courageous capture.
The bat interrupted the first quarter of a game Thursday night against the New Orleans Pelicans. The refs whistled for a timeout, Spurs player Rudy Gay bolted off the floor and hid behind an official, and LaMarcus Aldridge tried unsuccessfully to hit the bat with a basketball.
Seconds later, The Coyote bolted out from the opposite baseline, whiffed with one diving effort in front a cackling Popovich, then pounced on the bat with his net. An arena worker covered the bat with a towel and took it off the court while the mascot celebrated near center court.
After three bats delayed a game Thursday night against Phoenix, San Antonio had devised a game plan for another invasion. Before the game, officials set up lengthy netting to ensnare any bats that flew over the court. The Coyote made that all unnecessary.
Play resumed after a delay of about 90 seconds.

25903073,"NEW YORK -- Celtics All-Star and pending free agent Kyrie Irving got a warm welcome at Madison Square Garden on Friday night, with the crowd greeting him with a loud ovation during visiting player introductions for Boston's game against the New York Knicks.
Irving also heard cheers from the crowd each time he touched the ball early in the first quarter. And a chant of ""We want Kyrie"" filled the arena early in the second half.
With the trade deadline just days away, players are taking control of their own destinies more than ever before, and the league's teams are scrambling to keep up.
Kyrie Irving's future in Boston is now in doubt, and it's having a huge impact on the trade deadline.
Here are the dream scenarios for the Knicks, and what it would take.
Asked about the reception after Boston's 113-99 win, Irving replied, ""It's nothing but a distraction at this point. Like I said, I'm appreciative of the fan support I get in any arena. But of course, coming back home -- obviously, what's going on in terms of that noise and commentary, it's just a bunch of nonsense right now. So, can't do anything about it. I'm just accepting, I'm appreciative, but at the same time, I got a game to focus on.""
New York likely will pursue Irving in free agency this summer.
The Knicks' trade of Kristaps Porzingis on Thursday leaves them with the chance to have $71 million in cap space -- enough for two max free agents this summer.
Irving, 26, strongly implied earlier Friday that he isn't fully committed to re-signing with the Celtics, something he said before the season that he had planned to do.
When asked if his mindset regarding his decision to re-sign with the Celtics had shifted, Irving said, ""Ask me July 1."" He later added that the Celtics still remain ""at the head of the race"" regarding free agency.
Asked after Friday's game if he thinks the free-agency talk will cool between now and July 1, Irving said the answer is obvious.
Kyrie Irving is happy that other NBA players want to play with him, but he is irritated by the media attention.
""You know the answer to that, man,"" he said. ""Obviously you would hope it would quiet down. But like I said, it doesn't help when, across the league, it's just outside noise again, and my name gets thrown into it -- and conversations, speculations, everybody's worried about their credibility. I don't know how this media empire works. I know it's a bunch of nonsense to me. I have a focus on winning a championship this year, and that's where my focus is gonna stay. So even me saying something like that is not concrete enough for anybody.
""So, it is what it is. I gotta go home and take care of my friends and family, and that's the stuff that really matters for me.""
Irving was also asked Friday about the Knicks' decision to trade Porzingis.

""I respect the Knicks organization,"" Irving said. ""Obviously they are making moves to position themselves for this upcoming summer. So I wish them the best.""
Opposing teams expect the Knicks to be aggressive in pursuing the top free agents in the coming offseason, a group that includes Irving, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Kemba Walker and Jimmy Butler.
Some close to Durant see New York as a possible landing spot for the back-to-back NBA Finals MVP if he chooses to leave the Golden State Warriors, according to league sources.
Knicks president Steve Mills said Thursday that the club would take a conservative approach with its cap space.
""We're going to be prudent in how we use that room because we're still consistent in building this team through the draft and with young players,"" Mills said. ""And when there is an opportunity to add a free agent, that certainly is one of the tools that we have in our toolbox.""

25976730,"HOUSTON -- James Harden, nursing a sore shooting shoulder, needed a late scoring flurry Monday night to extend his streak of scoring at least 30 points to 30 consecutive games.
Harden scored 11 points in a 100-second span late in the fourth quarter to finish with 31 in the Houston Rockets' 120-104 win over the Dallas Mavericks. He extended the streak -- which Rockets general manager Daryl Morey has dubbed ""The Unguardable Tour"" -- by swishing a 30-foot pull-up with 52.9 seconds remaining.
Harden strained his left shoulder during Saturday's loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder and got extensive treatment over the past two days, interrupting his normal shooting routine. He struggled with his shot until late in Monday's win, going 9-of-23 from the floor and 6-of-17 from 3-point range.
James Harden scored 31 points for his 30th straight 30-point game despite dealing with a shoulder injury, leading the Houston Rockets to a 120-104 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night.
Kobe Bryant said he doesn't think the Rockets can win an NBA championship with reigning MVP James Harden continuing to play like he has.
""I couldn't get the lift that I usually have for my shot, but that's no excuse,"" Harden said. ""I'm just happy we won the game.""
Harden joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to have a 30-game, 30-point streak. Chamberlain had such streaks of 65 and 31 games.
Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni admitted that he assumed that Harden's streak would be snapped with a few minutes remaining in the game. But Harden hit step-back jumpers on back-to-back possessions, daggers that extended Houston's lead to 15 points with 1:57 remaining. He made a pair of free throws with 1:18 remaining and hit another 3 off an assist from Chris Paul to extend the streak.
It was the fourth time Harden has scored 10 points in the last three minutes of regulation, the most in the NBA this season. Each has happened since Jan. 19.
""I was worried about winning,"" said Harden, who also had eight rebounds, seven assists and five steals. ""They were making shots. They were coming back, cut the lead to 10 or nine points, something like that. So I just wanted to get the proper shots. Like I said, they put two on the ball and I got off it a few times, and we got some good opportunities.""
Dallas doubled Harden frequently throughout the game to force the ball out of his hands. That happened before Harden's final shot, but Paul made sure to get the ball back to the reigning MVP, well aware that the streak was at stake.
""For sure, for sure,"" said Paul, who had 17 points and 11 assists. ""He's got 28, so yeah, why not? We was up.""
The Rockets improved to 21-9 during Harden's streak, climbing from 14th to tied for fourth in the Western Conference standings during that span. Teammates admit that they're enjoying being a part of a historic run, but Harden often steers the discussion back to winning.
For example, Harden said the big smile that broke out on his face after his final shot was because ""we sealed the game,"" not a celebration of his streak being extended.
""At the end of the day, the object is to win games,"" Paul said. ""We never want to compromise a win or anything like that, and I think James has done a great job of that. At the end of the day, the name of the game is to win, and that's what we do.""
Harden said he hopes that rest and rehab during the All-Star break will allow him to regain strength in his shoulder. He anticipates that he will still be sore for Wednesday's road game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, but sitting out is not a consideration for Harden.
""If he comes to the arena, he's playing,"" D'Antoni said. ""I can't keep him out of practice, much less playing. He loves to play, and he knows his body. He can go through this. He's fine.""

25910657,"Marlon Moraes bullied his way to the front of the line of bantamweight contenders Saturday night, crushing Raphael Assuncao with a big right hand, then finishing him with a guillotine choke in the first round of their UFC Fight Night main event in Fortaleza, Brazil.
It is unclear, however, if there will be a title fight waiting for the presumed No. 1 contender.
Jose Aldo has been talking retirement, but on Saturday he turned back the clock with a TKO of rising featherweight Renato Moicano in the co-main event of UFC Fight Night: Assuncao vs. Moraes in Fortaleza, Brazil. Here's what went down on the undercard.
Though the UFC did not officially proclaim this bout at the Northeast Olympic Training Center to be an eliminator for the right to challenge 135-pound champion TJ Dillashaw, it has been widely assumed -- given that Moraes came in having won three consecutive fights, Assuncao four in a row -- that the winner would be first in line to face the 135-pound champion. However, Dillashaw has been angling to instead fight flyweight titleholder Henry Cejudo, who two weeks ago knocked him out in 32 seconds in Dillashaw's bid to add the 125-pound belt to his trophy case.
After beating Assuncao, Moraes mocked Dillashaw for dabbling in that potential scenario.
""Hey, TJ, I don't know if you deserve to fight with me,"" he said in an interview inside the Octagon. ""After your last performance, my friend, I'm sorry, I may have to take somebody else and let you go down and hunt for the little boys.""
Moraes (22-5-1), 30, got Assuncao to tap at the 3-minute, 17-second mark to earn his third straight first-round finish. He has won 17 of his past 18 bouts, the lone defeat during that run being a split-decision loss to Assuncao in their first meeting in 2017. That was the UFC debut for Moraes, a former World Series of Fighting champion.
Marlon Moraes calls out TJ Dillashaw after his win vs. Raphael Assuncao, saying he doesn't know if Dillashaw deserves a fight against him after Dillashaw's loss to Henry Cejudo.
The rematch started slowly and ended explosively. After the two Brazilians each had landed a few strikes, Moraes connected with an overhand right and, before Assuncao could gather himself, landed another big right that dropped him. Moraes swarmed, at first with punches, but then latched onto the guillotine. He ended up on top of Assuncao, the choke secured, and the tapout came quickly.
Assuncao (27-6), 36, had won 11 of 12 fights since 2011, the only loss coming in 2016 against Dillashaw. He also owns a 2013 victory over the champ.
The bantamweight title picture now would be crystal clear if not for the presence of the flyweight champion. Assuncao is No. 4 in ESPN's 135-pound rankings, Moraes No. 5. But the two contenders situated between them and the champ are Dominick Cruz, who is out with an injury, and Cody Garbrandt, who has lost to Dillashaw twice and is unlikely to get a third shot anytime soon.
Moraes would be the clear-cut next challenger if the champ were not fixated on Cejudo.
""I'm the best in the division, and you know who I deserve,"" Moraes said. ""You know our champion went down a weight class, but I'm ready.""

If the pick won, the ref got his two dimes. If the pick missed, the ref owed nothing; Battista would eat the loss. A ""free roll,"" as they call it. But this referee didn't lose much. His picks were winning at an 88 percent clip, totally unheard of in sports betting for any sustained period of time. They were now entering the sixth week of the scheme -- what you might call a sustained period of time.

Battista had known the ref, Timmy Donaghy, for 25 years. They'd gone to the same parochial high school in the working-class Catholic neighborhoods of Delaware County, just outside Philadelphia -- Delco, as it's sometimes called -- where the sports bars are abundant, where a certain easy familiarity with all forms of gambling prevails, where guys have bookies like they've got dentists.
Battista was a creature of that world. He was what's known as a mover. Strictly speaking, movers are neither gamblers nor bookmakers. They're a species of broker that provides services to sports bettors, laying down wagers on their clients' behalf with bookmakers of various types around the world, legal and not. Battista was positioned well enough in that world that, without Donaghy's knowledge but based on Donaghy's picks, he'd helped set up a kind of loose, disorderly hedge fund. Several people from the sports-betting underworld had, in effect, staked Battista a bankroll -- a fund he was now using to bet on games officiated by this one NBA referee. One member of the group called it ""the ticket"" and ""the company.""
""Maybe the company never sat at a table together,"" he says. ""But they all had a piece of the pizza."" The main problem now was keeping a lid on the thing.
In his endeavors, Battista had a sometime assistant, another high school chum, Tommy Martino, who acted as a liaison in the Donaghy scheme. Close friends with the referee since they were kids, Martino had a day job as an IT guy at JPMorgan. Using burner phones, Donaghy would call Martino and inform him of his pick for the game he was officiating. Martino would then relay the pick to Battista. Battista and Donaghy were never to speak directly. Battista would spend the day betting heavily on Donaghy's selection. In total, according to a person with knowledge of their operation, he hoped to get down about $1 million of his investors' money in each of Donaghy's games.
You want to get paid, you gotta cover the spread, Battista had told Donaghy. But Battista never used the word ""fix."" Or ""influence"" or ""manipulate"" or in any way discussed the mechanics of fixing.
""There wasn't no need to,"" Battista has told friends. The whole thing had been merely insinuated, a matter of strong innuendo. ""The only mechanics, he had in his hand. He had the f---ing whistle.""
IT REMAINS ONE of the most tantalizing questions in all of American professional sport: Does game-fixing still exist? In the 100 years since 1919, when gamblers blackened the Chicago White Sox, only the Tim Donaghy scandal has offered the hint of an answer -- but also a repudiation.
For 11 years, the official plotline has been that Donaghy was a rogue, gambling-addicted ref who made some bets on his own games -- and nothing more. The NBA conducted its own investigation and concluded that Donaghy, in fact, did not fix games. But for many in and around the league, suspicions have remained that the full story has not been told, that what really happened has been suppressed.
It matters all the more now. On May 14 of last year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that had forbidden states from legalizing sports gambling within their own borders. It's widely believed that the ruling will lead to a lifting of the interstate prohibition on sports betting, which, in turn, would give rise to a massive increase in the money wagered on American sports. At the same time, the NBA -- which once balked at gambling -- has now openly embraced legalized sports betting more than any other U.S. pro sports league. In 2014, commissioner Adam Silver penned an op-ed in The New York Times advocating for legalization. In July of 2018, he announced a multiyear deal for MGM Resorts to be the ""official gaming partner of the NBA.""
On Feb. 22, 2019, the NBA issued a statement in response to the ESPN story on the Donaghy scandal:
""The Tim Donaghy matter concluded over a decade ago with a full investigation by the federal government, Donaghy's termination from the NBA, and his conviction for criminal acts. At the same time, at the request of the NBA, former prosecutor Larry Pedowitz conducted an independent investigation of Donaghy's misconduct and issued publicly a 133-page report. This report was based on an extensive review of game data and video as well as approximately 200 interviews, thousands of pages of documents, and consultation with various gambling and data experts.
The ESPN Article attempts to revive this old story. Unfortunately, it is replete with errors, beginning with its statement that the Pedowitz Report ""concluded that Donaghy, in fact, did not fix games."" The Pedowitz Report made no such conclusion. Rather, the investigation found no basis to disagree with the finding of the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office that ""[t]here is no evidence that Donaghy ever intentionally made a particular ruling during a game in order to increase the likelihood that his gambling pick would be correct."" ESPN ignores this important distinction.
The new material that ESPN has assembled to support its own conclusion that Donaghy manipulated games is not strong and adds little to the existing record.""

Proponents of legalization have long argued that regulation leads to transparency, which helps root out game-fixing schemes. But there is much evidence to suggest the opposite. As economist Wladimir Andreff of the University of Paris has written: ""All economic analyses conclude that the more money there is inflowing to sport, the greater the sport corruption.""
And so it is that May's Supreme Court decision demands a review of the Donaghy affair. If it were shown that Donaghy had indeed fixed the games he reffed, it would reveal an uncomfortable truth, one that almost everyone -- leagues, teams, fans, gamblers -- would prefer to ignore: just how easy and profitable it is to fix an American sport.
In early 2017, inspired by the 10th anniversary of the scandal, ESPN set out to reinvestigate it. The research entailed interviews with more than 100 people, including current and former NBA referees, current and former NBA staff, gamblers, bookmakers, lawyers, law enforcement officials and friends and relatives of Donaghy. (Donaghy himself declined repeated requests for an interview.) Freedom of Information Act requests were filed. Thousands of pages of court documents and investigative records were scrutinized. Hundreds of hours were spent watching every NBA game Donaghy officiated in the 2006-07 season. Every foul call was logged, the resulting data analyzed, along with betting-market line-movement histories for every game Donaghy reffed that season.
Two years of reporting later, the story can now be told: This is the definitive account of how Tim Donaghy conspired to fix NBA games -- and how, in so doing, he unwittingly enriched an array of gamblers to the tune of likely hundreds of millions of dollars.
From March 2003 through fall of 2008, ex-NBA referee Tim Donaghy's life and career took a series of abrupt turns, and the story still isn't over.
Mendy Rudolph, Yogi Strom, Jake O'Donnell, Billy Oakes, Ed. T. Rush, Joey Crawford, Steve Javie, Tom Washington, Mark Wunderlich, Duke Callahan, Ed Malloy, Mark Lindsay, Aaron Smith, Tim Donaghy -- all NBA referees current, retired, dead or (in the last case) disgraced, all born and/or raised in the environs of Philadelphia. If there is a cradle of basketball refereeing, it is here.
Oakes was Tim Donaghy's uncle. Gerry Donaghy, his father, for a long time wore stripes at the highest levels of NCAA men's basketball. Malloy, Crawford and Callahan all attended Delaware County's Cardinal O'Hara High School, Donaghy's alma mater -- a cradle within a cradle. ""It was a job I was born to do,"" Donaghy wrote in his 2009 memoir, Personal Foul, but the sentence carries a double meaning. Blessed with the right connections, and after four years officiating in the CBA, the NBA's minor league, he was called up to the majors in 1994. He was 27 years old.
The referee's life has its contradictions. In-season, it is demanding, tiring, high stress. But the gig is well-paid -- even rookies in 2007 could make six figures. And then there's the offseason. By many accounts, it's like semi-retirement. ""If it wasn't basketball season, he had a lot of time on his hands,"" says one of Donaghy's friends.
In 1998, Donaghy joined a country club in West Chester, Pennsylvania, called Radley Run, along whose fairways the Donaghys built a spacious home. At the club he developed a circle of golfing pals. They played 18 holes four or five days a week. There was golfing but also drinking and gambling. Frequent excursions were made to the Borgata, a casino in Atlantic City. In the casino, Donaghy wore a baseball cap low to hide his eyes; everyone knows about the cameras in casinos, and the NBA forbade any gambling by its refs (with the exception, oddly, of horse racing).
Infrequently, Donaghy was at home. ""He was a single man, married with four kids,"" says Kim Donaghy, his ex-wife. ""He played golf and gambled.""
Any U.S. state that wishes can now offer legalized sports betting. We rank the states by likelihood to pass sports betting bills in the future.
The NBA has been on the leading edge of legalized sports betting. But what does the Supreme Court decision mean for the league and how will it affect the game?
The world's most feared sports bettor waits on his insider trading conviction appeal, to learn whether good behavior will cut his prison term and on whether the U.S. Supreme Court will do what once seemed unthinkable -- legalize sports gambling.
Probably Donaghy's closest friend in this crowd was a man named Jack Concannon. They'd known each other since high school. Like many in their cohort, Concannon had a bookie, Peter Ruggieri, who also golfed frequently with Donaghy and Concannon's crew. Short, squat, thick-necked, Ruggieri was built, some thought, like a small rhinoceros. In spheres other than the country-club set, he went by the nickname Rhino.
Donaghy has written that Rhino had a handicapping system for picking NFL and college football winners. In October 2002, Donaghy and Concannon decided to pool their money and wager on Ruggieri's picks. (Concannon declined comment for this story.) This was a clear violation of NBA rules, but Donaghy got over it. ""I started thinking -- or should I say, rationalizing: S---, everyone on the staff bets,"" he wrote. ""I was like a pot smoker moving up to cocaine.""
Then, at some point in 2003, Donaghy and Concannon crossed the Rubicon. According to Donaghy's account, the two were sitting alone in the Radley clubhouse after a round of golf when they decided to bet the NBA. But it wasn't just the NBA; according to court documents, they decided to bet on Donaghy's own games.
THERE ARE MANY misconceptions about the Tim Donaghy scandal. Perhaps the greatest is this: that Donaghy was the ref who colluded with gamblers on NBA games for one disgraceful season.
That is incorrect. According to a court document, Donaghy and Concannon placed their first bet on a game Donaghy was refereeing in March 2003 -- more than four years and four NBA seasons before he was caught.
He started small. In that first March, he bet on only two or three games. The next season, though, the volume rose sharply -- he made between 30 and 40 wagers on games he worked. Same with the season after that and the season after that.
He did well. By Donaghy's own admission in his memoir, so much cash started rolling in that he had problems knowing physically where to stash it so his wife wouldn't start asking questions.
Today, Kim Donaghy lives in Sarasota, Florida, where she and her then-husband and four daughters moved in 2005. Kim filed for divorce in late 2007, a few months after the scandal became public. When I visited her in Sarasota not long ago, at the office where she works, she made it clear the divorce was a long time coming. ""Tim was very, very secretive. He was always locked in a room, on the phone.""
In Sarasota, Kim Donaghy printed out for me the first 98 pages of her unfinished and unpublished memoir, The Ref's Wife. In it, she writes of the paradox of being both ""lonely for him"" and ""truly afraid of him."" She describes the moment she picked up his official NBA jacket to put it in the wash and found in the pocket ""a huge wad of $100 bills rolled in a rubber band."" How huge? With her thumbs and forefingers, she made an ""O"" the diameter of an orange. She struggled to recall exactly when, but she told me she probably started finding the cash in 2004, during the season. At the time, she told herself the money was from golf-course betting. But she would keep finding such rolls in his pockets as the years went on. When I asked, she said she never counted the money, never confronted him about its existence.
""Why?""
She gave a one-word answer: ""Scared.""
THEY CALLED IT The Office. A high roller named Mike Rinnier, who'd made his fortune in Delaware County supermarkets, decided to bankroll a small sports-betting syndicate in the 1980s. He staffed it with working-class Delco kids ambitious to earn. ""They were intelligent guys who just couldn't have full-time day jobs,"" says a former gambler who knew them. Battista, who'd drifted as a bartender, restaurant manager and small-time hustler after high school, was in his early 20s when, according to Gaming the Game, a book about the Donaghy scandal by former Philly police detective Sean Patrick Griffin, Rinnier recruited him to join the group. By chance, over the years its members had all acquired animal nicknames: Tiger, Rooster, Rhino, Seal, Sheep. And so their syndicate came to be known by some as the Animals.
In the early 2000s, the sports-betting world was undergoing its own equivalent of a dot-com boom. Black-market street bookies from all over the U.S., sharp pro gamblers and digital-savvy entrepreneurs with coding skills were all setting up online sportsbooks, often establishing themselves in places with little regulatory oversight, like Costa Rica, Antigua, Jamaica and Curaçao.
The Animals landed in Curaçao, where they helped launch an online sportsbook known as Play­ASAP. It was situated in a house a block off the beach. And it was there, in fall 2003 -- between beers under palms at the Mambo Beach tiki bar, between rounds of golf and late-night poker sessions at the Holiday Beach hotel's casino -- that the Animals began to cash in on one brilliant discovery.
Rhino Ruggieri was booking bets made by an acquaintance from back home, a guy he knew from the golf course named Jack Concannon. Back in Philly, Ruggieri had noticed that Concannon's bet sizes were an order of magnitude higher on certain NBA games. And those bets won -- won like Concannon had never won before. Normally this guy was a $100 or $200 or maybe $500 bettor. And normally this guy lost. But suddenly this recreational dumb-money insurance salesman was putting five dimes each on select NBA games and beating the bookies? Why? There had to be a pattern.
Since he was now affiliated with PlayASAP, Ruggieri was running all the bets that he booked back home, including Concannon's, through the Play­ASAP website. Everyone at the Curaçao office, therefore, had access to Concannon's gambling account. They'd studied his wagers. It hadn't taken long to deduce. Because he was a sometime member of the same golfing circle back home, Ruggieri knew that Concannon and NBA ref Tim Donaghy were friends. They checked the games. Who were the referees? Sure enough, there he was. One of the three was always him. F---ing Donaghy.
Holy s---! they thought. Donaghy and Concannon are betting on Donaghy's games -- and making a goddamn killing.
So what do you do when you stumble upon a possible criminal conspiracy in progress? What Battista, Ruggieri and the rest did was follow the Concannon-Donaghy bets with bets of their own -- $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 a game, according to a person familiar with the betting. Large sums but, if handled deftly, not large enough to alert the broader market that something screwy might be going on. They had possibly just stumbled on the ultimate edge. They now had one job: Do not lose the edge by letting the information leak. Whether Donaghy was using his whistle to fix games was beside the point. When Donaghy reffed and Concannon bet, the side he bet was covering the spread between 60 and 70 percent of the time. The Animals went so far as to study the box scores after each of Donaghy's outings. ""If you looked at the stats,"" said one gambler in The Office at the time, ""you could see he was calling more fouls on the team he bet against and less fouls on the team he bet on. That was obvious.""
Said another: ""Did I assume he was fixing the games? Yeah, I did. But I didn't give a s---, because it was great information. From 2003 to 2007, we didn't miss a game. Any game that he reffed we had a wager on.""
ON A NIGHT in early December 2006, Tommy Martino received an urgent phone call from Battista. Along with the rest of the Animals, Battista had returned from Curaçao in 2004 after PlayASAP had gone belly-up. Battista had since decided to set up shop on his own as a bet broker. Whatever his issue was, Battista said he couldn't talk about it over the phone.
A decade later, in the break room of the hair salon he worked in, Martino told me how it had gone: Martino had already known that their mutual buddy Tim Donaghy had been betting on his own NBA games with Concannon, and winning those bets. Battista, after discovering this, had been following those bets for the better part of the past four years. But now, when Battista arrived at Martino's house, he dropped the bomb.
The big problem, Battista said, was that the betting markets appeared to be getting wise to the emergence of an astonishingly accurate NBA handicapper. Because this edge, this treasure, was in danger of evaporating, Battista had decided that he needed to assume direct control over the referee.
Martino was not a gambler, had hardly ever placed a bet in his life. But he'd remained close friends after high school with both Donaghy and Battista, who, in turn, were never that close with each other. Martino, in that way, was about to become the unlikely bridge upon which the conspiracy would travel. To Martino, Battista seemed desperate, even frightened. ""You've got to arrange a meeting with Donaghy,"" Battista said.
IT WAS DEC. 12, 2006, a Tuesday, an hour before midnight, at the Philadelphia Airport Marriott, inside that hotel's primary restaurant, called at the time the Riverbend Bar & Grille. And it was there, in the otherwise vacant dining area, seated around a table, that Battista and Donaghy, with Martino witnessing, consummated their deal. Battista demanded that Donaghy never bet with Concannon again, and in exchange for providing Battista with his betting ""picks,"" Donaghy would receive $2,000 per game -- but only if the pick won. Much later on he would come to call this meeting ""the marriage.""
Accounts of the meeting differ. According to statements Donaghy made to federal law enforcement, Battista's deal was effectively an act of extortion. You don't want anyone ""from New York"" coming to your house, Battista told him. And: You don't want the NBA to find out about what you've been doing with Concannon.
According to Battista, though, it was Donaghy who reached out, asking for a meeting. Both Battista and Martino have said that there were no threats, that everyone was nervous but the situation seemed copacetic, and that what sold Donaghy on the deal was Battista saying to him: We know you're giving the games to Jack Concannon. And then, twisting the knife, Battista told him how much Concannon was winning.
Donaghy rose from the table. He had to use the bathroom, he said, and motioned for Martino to please come along. ""He gets so pale sometimes, he turns yellow, I swear to god,"" Martino told me. ""In the bathroom, Donaghy is like, 'Tom, you f---ing believe it?' And I said, 'What?' I'm thinking he's going to say: Oh s---! It got out to Battista that I'm giving games to Jack! But no. You know what he says? He goes: 'Do you believe it?' He goes, 'Concannon was making all that money and not giving me anything!'""
Back at the table, Martino and Donaghy told Battista that they needed to drive to a nearby gas station. They came out of the station bearing a packet of rolling papers, and right there inside the car, under the fluorescent gas station lights, in the rental-return sprawl adjacent to the Philadelphia International Airport runway, Martino rolled a joint. They passed it back and forth -- Battista, who'd snorted some coke earlier, demurred -- and as the car filled with smoke, they made, Martino told me, ""a pact."" The pact was: ""Don't tell anybody. Because that's how you get in trouble.""
The Celtics played the 76ers the night after the Marriott meeting. Donaghy worked the game. In the car at the gas station, according to Gaming the Game, Donaghy had said: Bet the Celtics. It was his first pick for Battista. The Celtics, favored by 2.5 points, went on to win in a blowout. One source with knowledge of the conspiracy says that Battista moved as much as $500,000 in wagers on this game: ""We had a big bet on that. We had a big bet on every f---ing game.""
Making bets at the highest levels of sports gambling is akin to the trading of any financial instrument. There's a defined trading session. It opens in the morning and closes right before tip-off. It's possible, in effect, to buy and sell bets, to go long or go short, to hedge. The best movers spend years compiling vast networks of clients and ""outs,"" or counterparties, with whom the movers can trade. Battista had such a network.
It's possible, through Don Best Sports, a betting information service, to pull the line-movement data for individual NBA games going back years. It's like looking at a stock chart. The data chronicle price fluctuations. If the spread widens during the trading session, then you know that demand among gamblers for betting on the favorite has intensified.
And indeed, the chart for the Boston-Philly game on Dec. 13, 2006, shows the price for Boston spiking and then shrinking back. Huge bets on Boston in the middle of the trading session, between 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., drove the spread from 2.5 to 3 to 4. In the NBA markets, betting experts say, any move of 1.5 points or more is considered unusually severe -- the result of millions of dollars pouring in.
The night after the Boston victory, according to all parties, the conspirators met once more, at Martino's house in the Philly suburb of Boothwyn. Battista arrived with a thick stack of $100 bills bound in a rubber band -- $2,000 for the agreed-upon fee and $3,000 as a sweetener. From here on out, Battista said, he and Donaghy would never communicate directly. Instead, Martino would be in the middle. They would use, per Martino's statement to the FBI, a code. Martino had two brothers. One, Johnny, lived in Jersey. The other, Chuck, lived in Delco. According to Martino, if Donaghy mentioned out-of-state Johnny's name, the pick was for the visiting team. If Donaghy talked about Chuck, bet the home side. Not exactly the Enigma cipher but better than yapping about specific teams and risking someone overhearing.
Ideally, Donaghy should make his pick as early as possible, preferably the night before his games, or at least the morning of. That way, Battista could begin to prepare the markets, to manipulate the prices in their favor. He would start before dawn with the enormously liquid Asian betting markets, an amorphous group of black- and gray-market internet sportsbooks based in places like Manila and Kuala Lumpur. Normally this meant making a few ""head fake"" bets. If you think the Celtics are the side that's likely to cover, then you go to market as early in the trading session as possible and put some money on Philly. Do it right and you can drive down the price of Boston. Then later in the day, with the price right, you gobble up all the Boston you can. According to Martino and Battista, after such wagering was complete, Battista, via Martino, would then inform Donaghy of the spread he needed to cover. And so it began ...
From Philadelphia, Donaghy hopping to a Nets home game, then 1,700 miles west to Denver, then over to Seattle, then transcontinental to Atlanta, then southwest to Houston, then back east to DC -- Donaghy zigzagging across the country, in and out of NBA arenas, making his picks to Martino over those cheap bodega burner phones, but not always, because sometimes they'd forget and use their own regular phones, because who cared? -- wins and wins and wins and wins, his picks almost 100 percent wins. ""How's Chuck doing?"" ""Say hello to Johnny for me ..."" 
Money drops and cash settlements in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania; in New York City; in Las Vegas; in San Francisco. Hundred-dollar bills in $10,000 packs, bound in rubber bands and delivered by trusted gofers. Battista hiking Donaghy's fee to $5,000 for each correct pick -- minuscule compared to the amounts Battista was now wagering ... Battista bowing his head to his desk and snorting a line of coke to stay alert, to stay awake. Martino late at night on the phone with Donaghy, the pair having developed a nightly before-bed ritual: If Donaghy's pick was a winner, if the spread had been covered, Martino calling the ref and whispering ""Good boy,"" and Donaghy echoing ""Good boy"" and then hanging up ... 
Donaghy calling two fouls 50 seconds apart against the 76ers' leading scorer, Andre Iguodala, in the third quarter against Boston, with the score's margin right on the spread. Iguodala heading to the bench; Boston covering the spread ... Donaghy in Seattle, the Sonics hosting the Mavericks, calling 11 straight fouls against Seattle as well as the last foul of the night, with 23 seconds to go. Dallas making both free throws, increasing its lead to eight. The closing line: Dallas by 8 ... Donaghy on New Year's Day in Charlotte calling 14 fouls against the Bobcats, five against the Timberwolves; the Wolves covering ...
Battista usually watched these games at home, but sometimes not. Watching would give him agita, he's said, at which point he'd have to turn off the TV: ""I remember being like, 'Oh s---, he's getting out of hand.' It was too obvious. I was like, 'If anyone's watching this, we've got a problem.' "" And still it went on ...
Donaghy in Dallas on Jan. 30 calling one foul against the home team and 12 against Seattle, including six straight against the Sonics when the margin was 13 or fewer. Favored by 12, Dallas covering ... Donaghy in Miami calling 12 fouls against visiting Charlotte, two against the Heat. The Heat covering ... Donaghy in Toronto calling four fouls against the visiting Nets' top scorer, Vince Carter, forcing him to the bench, the last one called by Donaghy when the ref was on the opposite side of the floor with the Raptors leading by three. Toronto, favored by 10.5, covering ...
Money now pouring into games Donaghy is refereeing, the lines during trading sessions swinging violently, like stocks beset by takeover rumors-widening and narrowing by 1.5, 3, 4.5, even 5 points, unheard of in the NBA except in the case of significant player injuries ... Battista popping pills, Vicodin and OxyContin, sometimes falling asleep at the dinner table at restaurants, sometimes vomiting blood. Battista wired and staying up all night and obsessively, blank-mindedly playing online blackjack and poker and even putting bets down on sports for which he had no special insight or inside information, and losing, losing, losing ... 
And then Donaghy whistling fouls on the visiting Heat 12 times in Madison Square Garden compared to four against the Knicks; the Knicks covering ... Martino flying to Toronto to pay Donaghy and to party, ordering prostitutes from a website ... Donaghy on March 14 in Indianapolis calling four straight fouls in the fourth against the underdog Pacers when they were losing by six to the visiting Wizards. Favored by 6, the visiting Wizards covering ... Battista on March 15 confessing to his wife that he'd lost $7 million of his clients' money ... Battista on March 16 strung out and sleepless at Martino's house and surrounded suddenly by almost his entire immediate family. An intervention ... Battista two days later wearing a bathrobe in rehab. 
Phil Scala had been investigating organized crime in New York City for almost 30 years when his squad received the tip. Each of the city's famous Five Families -- Genovese, Lucchese, Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino -- has a dedicated FBI unit investigating it full time, and Scala was the boss of the one focused on the Gambinos. Based in an anonymous office building in Kew Gardens, Queens, Scala and his agents had spent years assembling a network of informants inside the gang.
And now, Scala would later tell me, one of the squad's snitches had divulged this new tip, too delicious to be ignored. An NBA referee, according to the informant, was ""in the pocket"" of some people in the sports-gambling underworld. The informant didn't know any names, and the people with the ref in their pocket did not appear to be made members of the Gambino crime family. But the crucial betting information -- which sides of which games the ref favored -- had been seeping into the black-market gambling business. In particular, a crew of Gambino thugs in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn had figured out the formula and was supposedly, from what this informant had heard, winning millions on this ref's games. Illegal sports gambling was not Scala's focus. But stomping out a Mafia profit center was.
Scala reached the FBI's mandatory retirement age in 2008 and is now a private detective based on Long Island. But he has kept the investigative notes he took on his FBI cases, including the Donaghy case. Not long ago, he brought them out, looked at them and told me about them over the phone. (When I asked if I could see the notes myself, he laughed. ""Uh, no."") He said his old squad had received the initial ref-in-the-pocket tip in October 2006 -- almost two months before Battista had made his marriage with Donaghy.
Scala's squad went to work. Phone records of gamblers said to have connections with the Gambino crime family were obtained and analyzed, phone numbers traced back to names. As Scala told me, ""If you can envision a spiderweb -- it might not be directly, but one or two or three spheres out, you find a name. ... And then one afternoon the case agent came into my office. He said, 'We found the guy. We found the referee.'"" His name was Tim Donaghy.

In April 2007, a few days after Battista checked out of rehab for drug abuse, FBI special agents Paul Harris and Gerard Conrad knocked for the first time on Battista's door. They knew all about what he'd done, they told him; he was looking at 20 years. Better to cooperate. Lawyer, Battista replied.
Just before entering rehab, according to Martino and law enforcement documents, Battista had handed over the reins of the operation to Rhino Ruggieri. Ruggieri was to play the same role Battista had -- mover, fund manager. (Ruggieri did not respond to requests for comment.) But soon enough, Martino says, Rhino learned about the nature of Battista's deal with Donaghy. He and the other Animals who'd been following the bets were not happy. By now the spreads were moving violently. Word about Donaghy had permeated the market, followers following followers. Battista ""was just ruining something that was totally quiet, that nobody knew about,"" said one of the Animals. ""He started betting it with everybody and moving the lines like crazy. It was like: Why would you do that?""
In any case, Ruggieri before long decided to shut the whole thing down. The final game, Martino remembers, was a loss.
The effort to hide it was in vain. A grand jury in the case had been convened as early as February, according to FBI documents, and on May 30, Tommy Martino testified before it. Hours later, he called up Donaghy to tell him. In his memoir, Donaghy writes that he was standing on the first tee at his home golf club in Sarasota with a driver in his hands when he took the call from Martino. His body turned numb. He thought he was having a heart attack. ""The only concern I had,"" he wrote, ""was saving my own selfish sorry ass."" By June 15, Donaghy was sitting inside the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York in downtown Brooklyn, naming names and making a statement.
SIX DAYS LATER, on June 21, Scala, Harris and their boss, Special Agent in Charge Kevin Hallinan, traveled to the NBA offices in midtown Manhattan and sat down with commissioner David Stern and three other league executives: deputy commissioner Adam Silver, president Joel Litvin and senior vice president of security Bernie Tolbert, a former FBI agent. The agents informed Stern that it had come to their attention that one of their veteran refs, Tim Donaghy, had been betting on his own games and giving inside information to a gambling ring, for a fee. The Feds made no mention of game-fixing. To Scala, Stern seemed mostly upset that the NBA's in-house security people had failed to discover Donaghy's wrongdoing before the FBI. The commissioner promised the league's full cooperation.
Today, Scala considers that meeting a mistake. ""If you're going to ask me if I would do it differently now, the answer is yes. I would not have gone to brief Stern,"" Scala told me. (Through the NBA, Stern declined an interview request for this story.) In Donaghy's many conversations with the Feds through these weeks, he had begun pointing fingers and making allegations about other referees -- other refs who may have been corrupt. So the FBI had worked out a plan. ""We were prepared to do some undercover things to corroborate Donaghy's story,"" Scala says. Namely, they were going to wire up Donaghy so he could get other allegedly corrupted NBA referees to incriminate themselves.
About a month after the meeting with Stern, however, the New York Post blared news of the FBI investigation across its front page. ""Our plans were blown up by the fact that somebody leaked this,"" Scala lamented to me. ""I don't like to talk in terms of coulda, woulda, shoulda, but if the Post story didn't come out, [Donaghy] would have worn a wire, and I don't know where it would have gone. Things may have been different. That's the bottom line.""
Scala, at the time, was livid. He even contacted Murray Weiss, the Post reporter who wrote the story, to uncover the source of the leak. But Weiss, a veteran newsman, protected his source. ""He said, 'I can't tell you. It came from above,' "" Scala recalls. (When I contacted Weiss, who now works as a producer for CBS News' 48 Hours, he said he didn't recall this conversation.) Scala won't say whether he believes the NBA leaked the story. But Warren Flagg, a private investigator and former FBI agent who worked with Donaghy's attorney during the case, will. ""Someone in the NBA notified the press [in order] to stop this investigation, in my opinion. To shut it down.""
Weiss disputes that; he told me his tipster wasn't affiliated with the NBA ""as far as I know."" But the longtime crime reporter says he did at one point talk to a person ""involved with Stern and the NBA in that era."" The person wanted to deliver a message about Weiss' more critical reporting on the scandal. ""I was warned,"" Weiss told me, ""that if I stumbled, Stern would do anything he could to crush me. I was told, 'They're the kind of people who will do anything they can to protect themselves and the game.'""
ACCORDING TO SCALA, the truncated probe meant the Feds left several lines of inquiry hanging. Among them: Who made the real money? Who besides Donaghy, Battista and Martino was in on it?
There have been hints and suggestions. There is a footnote buried deep in Gaming the Game that refers to someone taking home in excess of $200 million. Several sports-betting experts -- two former underground movers and a longtime professional NBA gambler -- agreed that global markets contained enough liquidity in 2007 for an in-the-know bettor to win as much as $100 million.
There's also Scala, who told me he heard from his informants that underground gamblers ""could have been making over a hundred million dollars"" on Donaghy's games. Perhaps this is why the men who formed Battista's loose, disorderly investor group, the men who were ""on the ticket,"" have, for all these years, remained in the shadows. They were the gamblers and bookmakers closest to Battista. They were among his biggest brokerage clients and most trusted outs. Whether or not Battista made them explicitly aware of his agreement with Donaghy, their money was used to make one very specific genre of bet: games refereed by Tim Donaghy. They were the real moneymakers of the Donaghy scheme.
And now they can be identified.
One of them was a man nicknamed Tiger. In 2003 in Curaçao, when the Animals had made their original deduction and followed the Donaghy-Concannon bets, Tiger had been the leader of the Animals' betting office. ""Tiger was the brains behind that group,"" says one gambler who knew them well. ""No way Battista kept this quiet from Tiger,"" another told me. ""Tiger was his boss."" They were also brothers-in-law; the women they'd married were sisters. By most accounts, Tony ""Tiger"" Rufo is no longer a gambler. Over the course of the past decade, he's built a company that has become one of the biggest Planet Fitness franchisees in the nation, with more than 30 locations and exclusive rights to the regions of Philadelphia and Chicago. (Rufo declined to comment for this story.) One of Rufo's business partners in the gyms was his old Animals colleague Rhino Ruggieri. The management entity that controls the gyms is registered as Rhino Holdings, and according to its articles of incorporation, it was formed in Delaware County in February 2008.
Another man who profited off Donaghy was a well-known New York and South Florida bookie and whale who sometimes went by the nickname Popeye on account of his oversize forearms. He was a man who was, as they say, connected; a man from whose open hotel room window once dangled a person in debt to a Bonanno crime family member; a man whose clients included Hollywood celebrities; and a man who, back in June of 2006, had sat with Battista in a VIP box at Citizens Bank Park for an interleague Phillies-Yankees game. That was when he told Popeye that, come the 2006-07 NBA season, Battista would need to increase the size of some of his NBA wagers. These games would be mostly winners, so Popeye should feel free to move them -- and copy them too. Popeye, no dummy, asked the obvious question: Who's the handicapper behind these games? And Battista, perhaps surprisingly, perhaps not smartly, gave him the truth. There was this NBA referee named Tim Donaghy ... Popeye's eyes grew wide. Popeye, who died of heart disease in 2014 at age 61, was born in Manhattan and raised in Greenwich, Connecticut, but remained estranged from most of his family for most of the rest of his life. Popeye's real name was Taylor Breton, and he was the great-great-grandson of Marcus Goldman, the founder, in 1869, of Goldman Sachs.
Another key figure was Joseph ""Joe Vito"" Mastronardo, a major black-market bookie who served as Battista's most significant out. Married to the daughter of powerful Philly mayor Frank Rizzo, who held office in the 1970s, Mastronardo was well-connected. He had many lucrative gambling-related businesses. He served, for example, as a kind of shadow bank for the global underground gambling industry. For that reason, he had a lot of cash on hand. (The last time he was arrested, the police dug up his yard and found sections of PVC pipe buried there. Inside the pipes was $1.1 million.) To help get his clients' bets down, Battista as a bet broker needed Joe Vito. That's why, according to someone close to both men, Battista had no choice but to apprise Mastronardo of the Donaghy situation, to tell Joe Vito that this ref was picking sides in his own games-and, most likely, using his whistle to help the bet win. Joe Vito cannot speak to that today; he was busted in 2012 at age 63 for illegal bookmaking in an unrelated federal case. In 2015, Mastronardo had a stroke and died in prison.
Another moneymaker -- according to people with knowledge of the events -- was a man named Spiros Athanas. Born in Greece in 1960, a Boston street bookie in the 1980s, Athanas by the late 1990s had moved to Jamaica, where he turned himself into a sharp bettor and bookmaker on a global scale. According to multiple sources, Battista first began moving bets for Athanas in 2005. And at some point, per a person close to the situation, Battista had to tell Athanas, a heavy NBA bettor, that Battista believed he had a profitable edge; a different person close to Athanas' syndicate a decade ago told me that Athanas bet more heavily on Donaghy's games in the 2006-07 season than he did on other NBA games. An attorney for Athanas wrote to ESPN that Athanas never ""received information that Tim Donaghy ... was making wagers on games in which he was the referee,"" and so never made any bets based on any knowledge of the scheme. In 2013, Athanas was indicted as part of a federal sports-betting case that was unrelated to Donaghy. He forfeited $5 million, agreed to three years' probation and now lives in the Lakes Region of central New Hampshire, in a home with views of the cold blue lakes and, beyond them, the massed forms of the White Mountains.
One morning in early July 2007, Ronnie Nunn was asleep in a hotel room in Las Vegas when his cellphone buzzed him awake. Nunn, then the director of NBA officials, was in town for the NBA summer league games held annually among the casinos, where referee candidates from the minors are assessed for possible promotion to the Show. His mind still foggy with sleep, Nunn could hear the voice of his boss, Joel Litvin, then NBA president, asking questions about Tim Donaghy. Litvin's tone was urgent. Had Nunn heard anything about Donaghy's resignation? Had he heard about Donaghy's gambling ""issues"" -- about what he had done? Now sitting bolt upright, Nunn answered ""no"" to all the questions. Litvin then filled him in on the worst of it and told him there was an ongoing investigation, instructing him to say nothing about any of it to anyone. Then he hung up.
A few weeks later, four days after the Post story broke, David Stern gave his first news conference. His messaging was clear: Donaghy was a rogue. He'd acted alone. This was an episode of gambling, yes, but almost assuredly not match-fixing. ""Indeed,"" Stern assured the assembled media, ""as a matter of his on-court performance, he's in the top tier of accuracy.""
Stern's conclusion that Donaghy did not fix games would be validated by the federal investigation. Donaghy, in August 2007, and Martino, in April 2008, would plead guilty to two charges: conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to transmit gambling information. Battista would cut a deal, pleading guilty in April 2008 only to the charge of transmission of gambling information. Martino would receive a year and Donaghy and Battista 15 months each in federal prison. But while Donaghy would admit to betting on his own games in his plea agreement, he would not admit to fixing games.
Around the same time as Stern's news conference, the NBA also commissioned an investigation, to be led by Larry Pedowitz, a partner with the elite New York law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. With a team of four young lawyers, Pedowitz took a little over a year to conduct the probe and write up the findings in a 133-page report. (Pedowitz, who has retired from his firm, did not respond to requests for comment. David Anders, an attorney who helped Pedowitz run the investigation, declined to comment.) His brief was to audit the entire NBA referee program for corruption, but he also had a narrower goal: figuring out whether Donaghy had indeed fixed games. And, if he did, what was his method?
To answer those questions, Pedowitz convened a group of NBA basketball operations personnel to watch games worked by Donaghy during the 2006-07 season -- but the ensuing report did not fully explain the limited number of games they decided to review. The FBI had discovered that Donaghy had wagered on as many as 40 of his own games with Concannon during each of the three seasons between 2004 and 2006. Based on information from Tommy Martino, among others, there were reasons to suspect Donaghy had money on the vast majority of his games during the fateful 2006-07 season, from the very beginning until as late as April 11 -- 65 games in all. Yet the number of games reviewed by Pedowitz's group of NBA employees was only 17.
In this, Pedowitz followed the lead of federal investigators, who had analyzed video of Donaghy's games -- recruiting Nunn himself to review eight of them -- based on Donaghy's admission to the Feds that he'd wagered on just 16 of his own games in the final season of his career. (The Feds never said which 16 games they were, so Pedowitz's team had to deduce them from court documents and FBI requests for game videos, and the set of possible games it came up with was 17.)
The NBA employees ""examined every play and determined whether, in their view, Donaghy's calls (or absence of calls) were correct."" According to the report, only one of those 17 games, Pistons at Nets on Dec. 16, 2006, ""raised concerns that Donaghy's calls and substantial errors might have been aimed at favoring Detroit (which covered the point spread)."" In this game, the second after the marriage with Battista, Donaghy called five straight fouls on New Jersey in the fourth quarter when the spread was in doubt. Just one game of potential funny business out of 17 wasn't nearly enough to accuse the referee of anything.
And so, in the end, on the question of whether Donaghy fixed, Pedowitz upheld the findings of the U.S. Attorney's Office -- which never charged him with such crimes. ""Based on our review, and with the information we have available, we are unable to contradict the government's conclusion.""
But Scala, the FBI agent who pursued the case, has doubts. ""Donaghy says he never threw a game,"" Scala told me. ""But you know what? That never really flew with us."" According to Scala, his and the FBI's position has always been that Donaghy's deals with Concannon and Battista irrevocably ""tainted"" his capacity for officiating, even if only subconsciously. (This notion even found its way into the Pedowitz report itself.) Scala recalls that he and Donaghy went around and around on the issue. ""I said to him, 'Listen, don't tell me that you have some independent, decision-making ability in your mind's computer that's going to be unbiased, because that's not going to f---ing happen. All those gray-area decisions you have to make, Tim? Because you're betting on the game, your judgment is off -- and you threw the game.'""
Still, in Scala's telling, the FBI eventually just had to move on. Short of an outright confession, how could you prove that Donaghy had fixed the games anyway? And what more did you want? The guy's career was ruined and his life in shambles. They'd shut down a Gambino profit center. They were an organized crime squad, dealing with murder and mayhem. They had to get back to it. The Feds' job, on this one, was done.
IT WASN'T JUST Donaghy who tried to convince the FBI that he didn't fix games. The NBA did too. Whenever Scala's special agents interviewed NBA executives for the case, they heard a refrain: ""They told us, 'You can't fix a game in the NBA. It's impossible,'"" Scala says. Too many invested observers -- referee supervisors, coaches, players, owners, media, fans -- would be too quick to complain if they saw something fishy, the NBA argued. But as Scala put it, ""When someone tells you something's impossible, you know they're full of s---, because nothing's impossible. But that was the company line.""
Simply put, to show that Donaghy fixed games would suggest that it's easier for gamblers to manipulate games than any sports league would want to admit. Conspiracy theories about corrupted refs have dogged the league for decades. For that reason, the NBA is particularly wary of any hint of the fix. Even if it made them strange bedfellows, then, Donaghy's denials of match-fixing guilt were, in the end, a gift.
After Donaghy, the NBA put into place a host of new measures designed to detect any nascent game-fixing schemes. They included a beefed-up computerized system for monitoring refs' foul calls; enhanced scrutiny of betting-line fluctuations that might reveal suspicious wagering; the hiring of staff with experience in law enforcement, security and data analysis; and even the cultivation of tipsters within the sports-gambling industry who could relay rumors of possible corruption.
But at the time the scandal broke, the NBA closed ranks. Lamell McMorris served as the lead negotiator for the referees' union in its collective bargaining with the league. ""David Stern and I had never interacted much, and when we did it was not positive,"" McMorris told me. ""But Donaghy changed our working relationship. It was either sink or swim together for all of us.""

When the FBI began interviewing Donaghy's referee colleagues, the agents, according to Scala, eventually spoke to perhaps 10 of them. According to the FBI's investigation files, obtained in an FOIA request, some referees had to be served with subpoenas before they would talk to the Feds. The notes taken by the agents during these interviews have a mantra-like similarity: ""recalled feeling 'shocked' when he learned about Donaghy ... did not discuss this matter with other referees"" ... ""described his initial reaction as 'surprised' and 'shocked,' and stated that he did not discuss this matter with any other referees"" ... ""described Donaghy as a very accurate referee with few missed calls"" ... ""did not hear other refs discuss TD ... thought he was a good ref.""
To this day, what amounts to something like a self-imposed gag order on the subject of Donaghy persists, even among those refs who no longer work for the league. To discuss Donaghy with more than a dozen of them now is to sense that their silence has more to do with the fact that they hate the guy. None of them says anymore that Donaghy ""was a good ref.""
""I didn't touch it 10 years ago, and I'm not touching it now. ... Don't be fishing, because you ain't getting anything out of me."" ... ""I refuse to comment on him. I refuse to talk about him."" ... ""No one wants to talk about that. Or even put him in any kind of limelight at all. It's despicable."" ... ""I think there's enough that's been written about Tim Donaghy.""
Not every retired referee is reticent. There is, for one, Ed T. Rush, former NBA director of officials, a Philadelphia native and, for 32 years, a referee at the highest level, starting in 1966. When Donaghy was still slogging it in the minors in the early 1990s, Rush had taken it upon himself to mentor his young fellow Philadelphian. The Philly ref blood runs deep. ""His father is an outstanding man,"" Rush, now retired, says today. ""We all had expectations that Tim was going to be really, really good. And he could have been.""
After the scandal, Rush was among those NBA personnel tasked by Pedowitz with reviewing a set of Donaghy games for evidence of game-fixing.  Rush recalls watching maybe 10 such games. What did he see? When I asked, I expected Rush to answer much the same as Nunn had to me: Nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing to see here. Move along.
Instead, he surprised me. ""There were lots of whistles in the game, by him, that did not fit the game,"" he says. ""It's called literal interpretation.""
In the early 2000s, Rush went on to explain, the NBA undertook a wholesale revision of its refereeing guidelines, changes that would naturally lead to the entire NBA referee corps calling a greater volume of fouls, at least initially. All this occurred while Rush was director of officials, from 1998 to 2003. ""And like everything else, when you make changes, initially you'll have an overreaction. Typically. Then people settle in.""
But Donaghy didn't settle in. Rush, as director of refs, took notice but didn't think much of it at the time. It was only later, in 2007, after Donaghy had been exposed, that Donaghy's letter-of-the-law foul-calling acquired a darker hue. Watching games for Pedowitz, Rush noticed the same propensity to call ""literally interpreted"" fouls in situations where they were not warranted -- ones that ran counter to the flow of the game. Only this time, Rush viewed these calls with suspicion. Still, as Rush explained to me over the phone, these were just ""trends,"" not ""red flags,"" and the NBA and the Pedowitz people were interested only in red flags. ""They were looking for something real obvious. A play that had to be called one way and that [Donaghy] called the other way. That's what they were looking for. I didn't find it.""
In the end, Rush felt there was no need to relay his observations to the Pedowitz people. He felt the trends were embodied in the stats: The volume of Donaghy's calls was noticeable; it must be obvious to all. And so nothing about any of this would end up in Pedowitz's final report.
What does it mean to ""fix"" a game? And how, in turn, could you uncover evidence of it years, even a decade, later? The methods of fixing are rather straightforward. A player who's on the take can shave points, purposely missing baskets, say, in an effort to lower the score for his side. A ref, on the other hand, can effectively add points -- calling fouls that result in free throws. And if a ref were to target one particular team with fouls, he could push the score for the opposing side higher than it otherwise would be.
So where to begin? Donaghy officiated in 40 games between the marriage on Dec. 12, 2006, and March 21, 2007, which according to one source is likely the last game before Ruggieri took control of the scheme. We began by obtaining the trading histories for those games and through those determined which team was the more heavily bet upon. Furthermore, exceedingly large price jumps or plunges, or even the timing of certain price moves, could signal the trading strategies of a gambling syndicate. For all their desire to ply their trade in secrecy, sophisticated gambling syndicates often leave traces. Through them, we deduced which side Donaghy had picked for Battista to bet on.
Next, we pulled game videos for all 40 games and employed a researcher with an extensive background in officiating to watch them closely, logging all of Donaghy's and his fellow referees' foul calls. (Of those calls, 2.6 percent could not conclusively be attributed to a referee and were excluded from the study.)
It is normal, of course, for a referee to call more fouls against one team than the other. There will almost always be an imbalance of calls. But examine that imbalance against the financial imbalances discovered in the trading histories-which side received the heavier betting -- and the important comparison isn't between Donaghy's foul calls and the team that won the game. The important comparison is to the team that received the greater amount of betting dollars.
Once we completed all of that, what we uncovered was that Donaghy's foul calls favored the team that received the heavier betting 70 percent of the time. But we also found that in 10 games during that 40-game span, one team was defeating the other team to such a degree that the spread was rarely in doubt. A referee wishing to manipulate game scores on these occasions would likely find he lacked much ability to sway the matter -- or the need to do so, if the score was already in his favor. And so, controlling for blowouts by removing those games from the ledger, what we ultimately found was this: Donaghy favored the side that attracted more betting dollars in 23 of those 30 competitive games, or 77 percent of the time. In four games, he called the game neutrally, 50-50. The number of games in which Tim Donaghy favored the team that attracted fewer betting dollars? Three.
In other words, Donaghy's track record of making calls that favored his bet was 23-3-4.
If one assumes there should be no correlation between wagers and the calls made by a referee, the odds of that disparity* might seem unlikely. And they are. When presented with that data, ESPN statisticians crunched the numbers and revealed: The odds that Tim Donaghy would have randomly made calls that produced that imbalance are 6,155-to-1.

We also passed along our data to Keith Crank, who served for 15 years as the program director in statistics and probability at the National Science Foundation. To control for bias, he performed what's called a hypothesis test on these numbers, which would produce a P value, or a probability, for Donaghy's calls in each game in the 2006-07 season. He then did the same set of calculations for the other two referees on the floor in each of Donaghy's games. Crank's method boasted a certain elegance: It would capture any bias a ref might display in as simple a way as possible. Blowouts would be included. No line-movement data would be required.
Crank then calculated the P value for just Donaghy's calls for the entirety of the season in question. It was 0.232. In other words, there was a 23.2 percent chance these foul calls would happen randomly. Unlikely but not outrageously so. But Crank didn't stop there. There was, after all, that definitive frame within the 2006-07 season: the 40 games between the beginning of the marriage and the end of Battista's involvement. And if you exclude two split-foul calls -- the same foul called by two refs simultaneously and credited to both -- the P value for Donaghy's calls in that set of games was 0.041, or 4.1 percent.
To professional statisticians, any P value of less than 5 percent constitutes a signal that is ""significant."" It means you've found something. In our case, it means there's just a 4.1 percent chance that an unbiased ref would have randomly made the calls that Tim Donaghy did during his crooked run.
IN A STATEMENT to ESPN at the end of January, the NBA said: ""To be clear, the Pedowitz team and the NBA performed substantial statistical and data-based analyses to determine whether Donaghy attempted to manipulate games he officiated. All of our efforts were focused on understanding precisely what he did and how he did it so we would be best equipped to protect the integrity of our games going forward.""
The NBA wouldn't share the specifics of those statistical analyses, but it did describe them in summary form. According to the league, the studies were based on ""the entirety of the period during which Donaghy had admitted to gambling on games,"" including 194 games refereed by Donaghy himself, and entailed examinations of ""officiating accuracy,"" ""lopsided [foul] calling and the magnitude of lopsidedness,"" the timing of his calls during games, foul-call ""streaks"" and call volumes, along with an analysis of ""all associated betting lines and movements.""
""These analyses,"" the NBA told ESPN, ""did not support your finding that an unbiased official would not have made the calls that Donaghy did.""
TIM DONAGHY HAS always publicly denied that he deliberately manipulated games so as to win bets, arguing that he based his picks on insider information. Privately, however, he has at times taken a different position.
Ever since Donaghy emerged from prison in 2009, he has lived in the same unit in a town house apartment complex in Sarasota. He has given up making betting picks for a tout service, which he did for a time after his release from prison. His income now reportedly comes from rental properties he owns.
But before Donaghy even got out of prison, an imprint of Random House was reportedly set to publish his memoir. Per an account in New York magazine in 2015, the NBA somehow persuaded Random House to kill the book. Donaghy then found another publisher: a small, independent, newly established outfit -- so new that Personal Foul would be its inaugural volume -- based in Tampa, Florida, and operated by a political consultant and publicist named Shawna Vercher. That relationship would eventually turn acrimonious, winding up in court, with Donaghy successfully suing Vercher in 2010 and accusing her of stealing his book proceeds.
But the genesis of their falling-out occurred when Donaghy was still making the rounds to promote the book, according to documents filed in court as part of the lawsuit. The falling-out involved a polygraph test. Vercher told me that, in December 2009, after questioning from reporters, including ones from ESPN, she had wanted Donaghy to take a polygraph that asked point-blank whether he'd fixed games. Donaghy said he couldn't do that, Vercher recalled in a deposition. His attorneys, he told her, had advised him not to. Vercher asked him why.
Because, he replied, he would fail it.
IT WOULD NOT be the only time Tim Donaghy would come clean.
""He can influence a game six points either way -- that's what he told me,"" Tommy Martino said as we sat in the break room of his family's hair salon, where he's worked since he got out of prison in August 2009 after serving 10 months.
It took a second for me to comprehend what Martino was telling me. ""When did he tell you this?"" I asked. Martino couldn't remember, not exactly. ""During all this s---,"" he said.
Martino did recall Donaghy telling him that certain games would be unfixable. In Martino's words, ""Blowouts, he can't control."" If the score in a game widened too far beyond the betting line, Donaghy told Martino, Donaghy would be powerless to rein it back in. Because then ""you gotta call a lot of fouls,"" Martino said. ""And it's too obvious.""
A PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER once confronted Donaghy about the scandal. This was a few years after Donaghy's release from prison. A close observer of basketball, the gambler had become acutely curious after suffering losses on Donaghy-reffed games during that season.
The gambler described the conversation with Donaghy to me on the condition that I not use his name in the story. To the gambler's enduring surprise, Donaghy acknowledged that, yes, he deliberately called more fouls against the side he'd bet against. He told the gambler about other tactics as well.
""He said he liked to call an illegal defense call, right away, in the first minute."" That way, the gambler said, Donaghy could force the side he'd picked against to play a little less aggressively on defense. ""He said he'd pick on the big center, or the most valuable player of each team, and he'd try to get them in foul trouble.""
The gambler added, ""He also told me they were betting millions and he was an idiot not to ask for more.""
AND THEN THERE was a former friend of Donaghy's named Aron Kulle, who recalled the time Donaghy came to his office in Sarasota in a state of high anxiety. Like so many others in Donaghy's life, Kulle and the referee would eventually have a vitriolic falling-out; at one point, Donaghy won a stalking injunction against Kulle. But at the time of the visit, in late 2007, Kulle said, the men were close.
Since moving to Sarasota in 2005, Donaghy had often volunteered for the local youth sports leagues that Kulle ran out of a community center. Now, after Donaghy's downfall but before he headed to prison, Donaghy broke down and wept inside Kulle's office. ""My life is ruined,"" Kulle recalled Donaghy saying.
The office's windows looked out onto a basketball court, where children on youth teams were just then practicing. Their sneakers squeaked on the hardwood. Kulle got up, crossed the room and closed the blinds. That's when Donaghy ""laid everything out"" and ""spilled everything,"" Kulle said.
""He knew what the spreads were going to be. He knew how to control it. He knew how to get into other referees' heads too, about different players ... because [the other refs] would follow him. ... He admitted to fixing the games.""
When Donaghy had finished, Kulle leaned back in his chair. He'd been raptly listening to the referee's story -- the gambling, the cash, the secrecy, the corruption, the endless search by human beings to gain an edge, the gross opportunism that seemed almost contagious, the almost shockingly easy fixing of a major American sport -- but now there was one big thing on Kulle's mind, and it wasn't the moral of the story. Or, actually, it was the moral of this story.
""If what you're telling me is true,"" Kulle said he told Donaghy, ""you're gonna be rich.""
Kulle's eyes were practically dollar signs. He was already thinking, How can I get a piece of this action? Can I maybe even invest in this thing? In that moment -- like the many people before him who'd expanded and abetted the scheme and profited from it -- Aron Kulle sensed opportunity.
""All I'm seeing,"" he said he told Donaghy, ""is a movie.""

25948036,"The Los Angeles Lakers might not have traded for Anthony Davis before Thursday's deadline, but Lakers star LeBron James made sure Davis will be playing on his team next week in the NBA All-Star Game.
James selected Davis, the New Orleans Pelicans star, in the All-Star draft on Thursday night. He took Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant with his first selection. Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo -- the captain of the team opposing James' side -- selected Golden State guard Stephen Curry with his first pick.
James also selected Boston's Kyrie Irving, Toronto's Kawhi Leonard and Houston's James Harden, respectively, from among the starters.
Antetokounmpo selected Philadelphia's Joel Embiid, Oklahoma City's Paul George and Charlotte's Kemba Walker, respectively, among the pool of starters.
From the ""tampering"" accusation to the trade heard round the All-Star world, let's break down the draft between captains LeBron and Giannis.
From the celebrity game to the dunk contest to Team LeBron vs. Team Giannis, we've got you covered for all things All-Star in Charlotte.
After the trade deadline passed Thursday, Pelicans GM Dell Demps announced that star center Anthony Davis will play the rest of the 2018-19 season rather than be shut down.
James and Antetokounmpo drafted the rosters from the pool of players voted as starters and reserves in each conference. They made their selections without regard for a player's conference affiliation or position. James had the first pick, as he had the highest voting total in the league.
Eight starters were drafted in the first round. Fourteen reserves were taken in the second round.
James' selection of Davis is sure to garner attention, as the Lakers offered the Pelicans trade packages in an attempt to acquire Davis in the days leading up to Thursday's deadline, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Davis told New Orleans late last month that he doesn't wish to sign an extension with the team and requested a trade.
James also took all of the players who could be free agents at the end of the season -- Durant, Irving, Leonard and Klay Thompson -- as well as a potential 2020 free agent in Davis, which led to a funny exchange between the two captains.
Antetokounmpo suggested during the draft -- which was televised by TNT -- that James was tampering after he selected Davis.
""Isn't that tampering?"" Antetokounmpo asked.
""Tampering rules [do] not apply on All-Star Weekend,"" James said, laughing.
James selected Davis with his first pick in the second round. He also drafted Thompson, Portland's Damian Lillard, Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook, San Antonio's LaMarcus Aldridge, Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns and Washington's Bradley Beal. Beal was selected last.
Antetokounmpo selected teammate Khris Middleton in the second round. He had the first pick in the round. He also drafted Denver's Nikola Jokic, Philadelphia's Ben Simmons, Detroit's Blake Griffin, Brooklyn's D'Angelo Russell, Orlando's Nikola Vucevic and Toronto's Kyle Lowry.
Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki and Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade were named by NBA commissioner Adam Silver as special team roster additions for the All-Star Game. Wade and Nowitzki were drafted in the third and final round.
James, selecting first in the third round, selected Wade, his close friend. That left Nowitzki for Antetokounmpo's team.
At James' urging, the captains then agreed to a trade of Westbrook for Simmons.
The draft was shown on TNT on Thursday night after being taped earlier. The process was not televised last year -- the first iteration of the current format -- to the dismay of James and other players.
All-Star reserves were selected by the coaches. Starters were named through a process combining fan votes (50 percent), media votes (25 percent) and player votes (25 percent).
The All-Star Game is in Charlotte on Feb. 17.
Denver coach Michael Malone and the Nuggets' staff will coach Team LeBron. Mike Budenholzer and the Bucks' staff will coach Team Giannis.
For the second year in a row, both NBA All-Star Game teams will make donations to community-based organizations. The winning team's charity will receive a $350,000 donation from the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association, while the losing team's organization will receive $150,000.
Team LeBron will play for Right Moves for Youth, a school-based, dropout-prevention and student-support program in Charlotte. Team Giannis will play for for Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, which aims to eliminate hunger by soliciting and distributing food and household items to people in need.
Team Giannis chose to play in white uniforms. Team LeBron was assigned the black uniforms as the visiting team.
Silver will select the replacement for any player unable to participate in the All-Star Game. He will choose a player from the same conference as the player who is being replaced. Silver's selection will join the team that drafted the replaced player.

25976422,"The New York Knicks set a single-season franchise record Monday when they lost their 17th consecutive game 107-104 to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The Knicks, who last won Jan. 4 against the Los Angeles Lakers at Staples Center, broke their previous record of 16 straight defeats set in 2014-15 when they finished with a franchise-low 17 wins.
This season's Knicks team is now 10-46 -- the worst record in the NBA -- with 26 games to play.
The franchise's longest overall losing streak was over the course of two seasons, from March to November 1985.
Monday's 17th straight loss also tied the Knicks with the New York Mets -- who lost 17 in a row in their expansion season in 1962 -- for the longest single-season losing streak by any New York-area team in the past 100 years.
As one of the three teams with the worst record in the NBA, the Knicks right now have a 14 percent chance of getting the first overall pick in the NBA draft.
Their next chance to end this current skid comes Wednesday against the Philadelphia 76ers.

25940828,"The Washington Wizards traded forward Otto Porter Jr. to the Chicago Bulls for forwards Bobby Portis and Jabari Parker and a protected 2023 second-round draft pick, the teams announced Wednesday night.
Porter, 25, is averaging 12.6 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game this season. He is making $26 million this season and is owed $27.25 million next season, with a player option for 2020-21.
Portis will become a restricted free agent this summer.
What does this mean for the Bulls and Wizards? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
The Wizards traded Markieff Morris to the Pelicans for Wesley Johnson.
The Bulls have been trying to trade Parker, who has a team option for next season worth $20 million.
Portis and Parker left Chicago's United Center shortly before the Bulls tipped off against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday. Parker was expected to leave for Washington on Thursday morning, his father told ESPN.
Several Bulls players said they were sad to see Portis and Parker go. Bulls guard Zach LaVine called Parker ""the main glue of the team, a big-time voice.""
""It sucks. He's one of my best friends on the team,"" LaVine said. ""Jabari and me talk all the time. It sucks he didn't get the way he wanted to come here. A Chicago kid, I don't think he got the fair end of the stick on that one. It's the NBA, man.""
""Those two are great players, and they're gonna go out there, and they're going to be ready. Y'all know how I feel when I play against Minnesota,"" added LaVine, who began his career with the Timberwolves. ""They're going to feel the same way playing against us.""
News of the trade reached the Wizards' locker room about a half-hour before the team's game against the Milwaukee Bucks.
""It was a little weird,"" Wizards guard Bradley Beal said. ""But you have to be a professional about everything. Decisions are made. People come and go. It's unfortunate. Otto was a part of the franchise for a long time. All we can do is continue to move on.""
The trade comes one day after the Wizards announced that star point guard John Wall, already out for the season with a left heel injury, will miss most -- if not all -- of next season because he needs surgery on his left Achilles tendon.

Also Wednesday, the Wizards traded forward Markieff Morris to the New Orleans Pelicans for forward Wesley Johnson, the teams announced.
Washington's two trades will provide significant financial savings, moving the team $232,000 below the luxury tax threshold. Since the start of the season, the Wizards have saved $18.3 million toward the luxury tax.
Parker's $20 million team option needs to be exercised by June 29. Portis is on an expiring contract, and the Wizards will have until the end of June to submit a $3.6 million qualifying offer.
Beal said he is confident Porter will acclimate to his new team quickly.
""I know what he is capable of doing,"" Beal said. ""He has the ability to go lead a young team now. I know he will do well there. We will welcome Bobby, and we got Jabari too, right? So we will welcome both of them and keep moving forward.""
Wednesday's 148-129 loss to the Bucks dropped Washington to 22-32, four games behind the Miami Heat for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

25960935,"The All-Star center scored 14 points and grabbed 16 rebounds in the 99-90 loss. This after Davis sat out the fourth quarter of Friday night's home victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.
Met with boos and cheers in his return to the Pelicans' lineup Friday in New Orleans, Anthony Davis said he was surprised by the jeers but was ""just happy to be back on the floor playing the game that I love.""
The Pelicans decided to play Anthony Davis after talks with the NBA in which the league stressed that the team could be subject to a $100,000 fine for every game Davis didn't play, citing a two-year-old rest rule, sources say.
Some voices in the Pelicans organization supported not playing Davis after the team decided not to trade the All-Star by Thursday's trade deadline, sources previously told ESPN. The Pelicans, according to sources, were told by the NBA they would be subject to a fine of $100,000 per game if Davis were benched.
Davis and the team agreed that his minutes would be reduced and that Davis would consult with the Pelicans on which ends of back-to-backs he will play in the rest of the season, sources told ESPN.

25955080,"Randolph and young forward Justin Jackson were sent to the Mavericks in a deal that came together while Barnes was playing for Dallas in a 99-93 win over Charlotte on Wednesday. Jackson was active for Friday night's game against Milwaukee.
The 37-year-old Randolph never played for the Kings in his second season with them. He was a frequent Dallas foe during his eight seasons with Memphis. A day after the trade, Mavericks president of basketball operations Donnie Nelson said he didn't expect Randolph to play for the club.
Randolph has averaged 16.6 points and 9.1 rebounds in 17 seasons with five teams.
By trading Barnes, the Mavericks put themselves in position to acquire another front-line player to go with rookie sensation Luka Doncic and 2018 All-Star Kristaps Porzingis.
Dallas traded for Porzingis last week in a seven-player deal with New York that starters Dennis Smith Jr., Wesley Matthews and center DeAndre Jordan to the Knicks. Porzingis won't play this season as he continues to recover from a knee injury sustained last February.

25975618,"MIAMI -- Kevin Durant should have been called for a discontinued dribble on the Golden State Warriors' final possession of what became their 120-118 win over the Miami Heat, the NBA said Monday in a report detailing all calls made in the last two minutes of the game.
Golden State made a pair of free throws on that possession, the final points of the game.
The league, in its Last Two Minute Report that is released after close games, said it reviewed multiple video angles to determine that Durant's dribble was not interrupted by the ball making inadvertent contact with the foot or shin of Heat defender Justise Winslow and ""a discontinued dribble should have been called on Durant.""
Also, the league opted not to fine Heat coach Erik Spoelstra for his postgame comments about the officiating -- which were prefaced by Spoelstra beginning his remarks with ""Look, NBA, do not fine me. I'm allowed to say this.""
Spoelstra also said multiple times in his postgame news conference that he was not blaming referees for the loss.
As they exchanged jerseys following Sunday's game at Oracle Arena, Stephen Curry made a point to ask Dwyane Wade, ""Are you sure you don't have a couple more years left in there?""
Durant was being defended by Winslow with about 10 seconds left in a tie game, dribbling as Golden State's DeMarcus Cousins came to set a pick, the whole play unfolding not far from referee Kevin Cutler. Durant lost control of the ball and Heat assistant coach Chris Quinn -- standing just a couple feet from referee Jason Goldenberg -- was among those immediately lobbying for a violation to be called.
Goldenberg signaled that Durant's dribble was deflected by Winslow, which replays showed was not the case. The play continued, Durant missed a 3-point try, and Cousins got the rebound, was fouled and made two free throws with 5.4 seconds remaining in what became the final points of the game.
""It's a double-dribble. Everybody can see it,"" Spoelstra said after the game. ""Those are tough calls to make but everybody saw it. It's right there in front of everybody. That should be a violation and you can't miss those calls. But we had our chances. Like I said, it was back and forth. The officials -- so let's be clear about it, so I do not get fined -- that's not why we lost.""
Miami still had a chance to win, but Dion Waiters' 3-pointer bounced off the rim as time expired. The loss knocked Miami, which was playing at Denver on Monday night, out of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
The Warriors took 26 free throws to Miami's eight, which also irked Spoelstra.
""You hate to see 26-8 when our guys are going aggressively,"" he said.
The league's review included study of 26 different events that went on in the last two minutes, and the league said the 25 others were all handled correctly.

25942871,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant went off on the media's coverage of his pending free-agency decision this summer following a 141-102 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night.
Durant hadn't spoken to beat writers since before the New York Knicks traded away Kristaps Porzingis last week, thus clearing out the cap space to chase him and another free agent this summer. Durant sounded angry and frustrated Wednesday about recent stories speculating that a decision about his future had already been made and that he would be headed to the Knicks after the season.
""I have nothing to do with the Knicks,"" Durant said. ""I don't know who traded Porzingis. They got nothing to do with me. I'm trying to play basketball. Y'all come in here every day, ask me about free agency, ask my teammates, my coaches. You rile up the fans about it. Let us play basketball. That's all I'm saying. And now when I don't wanna talk to y'all, it's a problem with me.
""Come on, man. Grow up. Grow up. Yeah, you -- grow up. Come on, bro. I come here and go to work every day. I don't cause no problems. I play the right way, or I try to play the right way. I try to be the best player I can be every possession. What's the problem? What am I doing to y'all?""
Anthony Davis is still a Pelican, but big names like Marc Gasol and Markelle Fultz are on the move. Get the latest news and analysis, including trade grades and after-the-buzzer updates.
Which players and picks are on the move? We have a rundown of the latest deals.
Durant was particularly angered by a column in which The Athletic's Ethan Strauss noted that many around the league believe Durant is heading to the Knicks. Durant called out Strauss by name before adding how he doesn't trust the media.
""It's unnecessary,"" Durant said of all the noise surrounding his decision. ""You got a dude, Ethan Strauss, who comes in here and just gives his whole opinion on stuff and makes it seem like it's coming from me. And he just walks around here, don't talk to nobody, just walk in here and survey and write something like that, and now you gotta pile on me because I don't wanna talk to y'all about that.""
While Durant hadn't spoken to beat writers since before a win over the Indiana Pacers on Jan. 28, he had done a handful of interviews with other outlets before Wednesday night, including sitting down for a story on the Warriors that will air on CBS' ""60 Minutes."" The narrative of him not speaking to the media gained steam when the normally approachable Durant hadn't spoken to the assembled media since the Knicks deal went down and speculation surrounding his future intensified.
""I just don't trust none of y'all,"" Durant said. ""Every time I say something it's getting twisted up and thrown out and in so many different publications, trying to tear me down with my words that I say. So when I don't say nothing, it's a problem. I just wanna play ball. I wanna go to the gym and go home. That's all. Is that a problem? All right then.""
Asked by a Warriors PR official whether there were any questions related to the game, Durant rebuffed a question regarding how the Warriors have been playing.
""All right. I'm done."" Durant said. ""You know you don't care about that.""
Durant's postgame news conference lasted just over 3½ minutes before the abrupt ending. Initially, Durant asked reporters why they cared that he hadn't spoken but then acknowledged that he just didn't want to talk recently.
""I didn't feel like talking the last couple days,"" Durant said. ""I just ain't feel like it.""
Did it have anything to do with free agency?
""That's the conversation you gonna have,"" Durant said. ""I don't think about that type of stuff. That's your job.""
As hard as Durant and the Warriors have tried to push the speculation away, the reality is that his free-agency decision has hovered over everything the group has done this season. Durant told ESPN before the regular season that he planned to be transparent about the process, but he has shied away from most questions surrounding his future, especially after an emotional blowup between him and Draymond Green during a loss to the LA Clippers in November, an argument that centered at least in part on his future with the team.
Teammates and coaches have understood all along that the decision and speculation have weighed on Durant, but he hadn't allowed those feelings to come out this publicly until Wednesday.
""Honestly, I think it's more him not being able to control his own voice in terms of, obviously he's talked about it from time to time throughout the year, he's focusing on basketball,"" Warriors guard Stephen Curry said. ""And that's what he should do. We want to see that K every day. So what he can't control is B.S. that happens in the media or people making a decision for him or all this other stuff. So in terms of him just playing basketball, focusing on what happens out there on the 94 feet, being there for us as his teammates and us being there for him. That's what he can control, and I think he's doing a great job of that. So all the other stuff, I wouldn't call it a distraction, it's just more so from his standpoint frustrating. Again, the way that he plays basketball and the way he is a teammate, that's all we're worried about, and I think he's doing a great job of that.""
What also seemed to have triggered Durant's emotions was a column written by the Bay Area News Group's Dieter Kurtenbach, in which Durant's future with the Knicks was discussed. Durant, who is active on social media, spent Sunday liking many tweets that opposed the article.
""Why do I gotta talk to you?"" Durant said at one point. ""Tell me. Is that gonna help me do my job better? Nah. I didn't feel like talking.""

25975377,"As the Los Angeles Lakers get past the unpleasantness of last week and look to focus on the future, they'll need to decide on whether they want to be in the Anthony Davis business or not.
If they are not planning to re-engage the New Orleans Pelicans on a Davis trade after the season and want to focus on free agency, as team president Magic Johnson hinted Sunday, then it's pretty simple.
""That's not going to change our plans this summer,"" Johnson said. ""It's a great [free-agency] class, and we just want to get one of them.""
Lakers president Magic Johnson said the Pelicans didn't act in good faith in their negotiations involving Anthony Davis.
Here's what the teams still in the Anthony Davis sweepstakes can offer in the offseason.
If the Lakers do sign a max-level free agent this summer, as their plans indeed were before Davis became available, then they are most likely out of the Davis free-agency sweepstakes in 2020. It's not impossible, but it would be hard to clear enough cap space with LeBron James also on the roster.
But if they harbor a belief there's still a chance of landing Davis in 2019 -- perhaps when he comes back on the trade market around the draft -- the Lakers are going to have to change their approach. And as bleak as it might look now after a week of the Pelicans and Lakers tossing public and private jabs at each other, it's not out of the question.
It will take a tactical change from the Lakers and some hard work. And it might take some cooperation with the Pelicans, who might have different priorities and possibly different voices by summer.
New Orleans didn't like what was on offer from the Lakers for Davis, not unlike how the San Antonio Spurs felt last summer when there were brief Kawhi Leonard trade talks. The Lakers can steam about this or they can do something about it -- by changing what's on the menu.
If the Lakers don't have what the Pelicans want, then they need to go out and see if they can find what the Pelicans do want and try to bring it to them. This is how transactions at the highest level work in the NBA these days. Getting a player of Davis' quality might take some arbitrage, deals to set up other deals.
The communication between the Pelicans and Lakers was almost nonexistent leading up to the trade deadline. Saying there were negotiations might not even be accurate. By all accounts it was a one-way conversation, with the Lakers opening up their wallet and the Pelicans turning up their nose.
As such, there were no significant three-team deals discussed with the Lakers scouring the league to find connections to improve their offer. But there absolutely could have been. That is maybe the most realistic path to finding a way to make Davis a Laker, widening the trade talks to include options the Pelicans prefer.
Brian Windhorst, Jackie MacMullan and Tim MacMahon discuss the fallout behind the Pelicans and Lakers non-trade. Listen now!
The Pelicans didn't view Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma as a package good enough for Davis. But if the Lakers had offered the players around the league individually, they'd likely have been able to land draft picks and other young players, assets that then could be included in a reworked trade package.
Same for the draft picks the Lakers were willing to send to New Orleans. Shopping those around, especially with their pick headed for the early-to-mid teens this summer, could help land pieces that could get the Pelicans more interested.
To understand how this might work, take a look at the LA Clippers. They were on Davis' ""list"" of places where he had expressed a willingness to sign an extension, but would have had a difficult time assembling a deal because so many of their players were free agents-to-be.
Then the Clippers swung the Tobias Harris trade with the Philadelphia 76ers, picking up four draft picks and prospect Landry Shamet, and suddenly they're flush with trade assets in addition to the players still on their roster. If the Clippers choose -- and for the time being, they seem to be focused on 2019 free agency -- they could now make a more compelling offer for Davis.
It's not that the Lakers feel their young players are too precious; they were willing to trade all of them for Davis. Other than LeBron James, the Lakers don't seem too attached to any player on the roster at the moment.
As Johnson said: ""They're professionals. All of them. And this is how this league works. They know it, I know it -- that's how it goes.""
Right now, there are hurt feelings between the Lakers and Pelicans. But it will pass. If circumstances leave the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks, two teams expected to have interest in bidding for Davis after the season, unable to deliver what New Orleans wants, the Lakers will have a chance to get back in the game.
The Celtics aren't sure what will happen with Kyrie Irving and the Knicks don't know where their draft pick -- and therefore their best trade chip -- will land.
In the end, it might still not be enough. The value of the Lakers' young players might just not be what is needed, be it piecemeal or together. Swinging big in a deep free-agent market, even one stocked with other attractive bidders, might be the better course than going through all the possible angst.
But closing the door before getting more aggressive and creative might be a mistake. Davis is that good. And as the Lakers plot their summer moves, changing the Davis conversation with New Orleans ought to be one of their serious options.

25976766,"OKLAHOMA CITY -- As the crowd showered him with a raucous standing ovation, Russell Westbrook turned to the Portland Trail Blazers bench and gave a little wink.
A drive and kick to set up Paul George for a 3-pointer made NBA history Monday night: a 10th consecutive triple-double, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's mark of nine straight set in 1968.
""Definitely an unbelievable moment,"" Westbrook said. ""I don't know, because honestly, bro, I know what I'm capable of doing, and I just go out and compete and whatever happens, happens, man. I never even dreamed of playing in the NBA or standing here talking to you guys. So, each moment is a blessing for me. Each time I get to walk into this locker room and see my name up there, it's a blessing for me.
""That's an unbelievable moment in of itself. Just to be able to wake and be able to have a job, have a jersey, have a name on your back, because to me that's a blessing itself and something I never even dreamed about as a kid.""
Setting the new triple-double standard looked like a long shot for Westbrook, needing five assists in the final eight minutes of Monday's contest. But with a quick flurry of setups, the Oklahoma City Thunder point guard was up to nine assists with four minutes to go. On a pick-and-pop with George, Westbrook hit his All-Star teammate in rhythm, and the rest was ... well, history, as OKC topped Portland 120-111.
Russell Westbrook set an NBA record with his 10th straight triple-double, Paul George scored 47 points, and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Portland Trail Blazers 120-111 on Monday night.
""I thought he had it already,"" George said. ""Usually, Russ has that by the first quarter. I didn't know it was that close.""
Westbrook finished with 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists in 37 minutes. It was his league-leading 23rd triple-double of the season.
The triple-doubles didn't end there, though.
Westbrook returned the favor a few minutes later, hitting a deep 3 set up by George, giving George his third career triple-double -- with 47 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, featuring 15-of-26 shooting and 8-of-13 from 3.
""We talked about it right before that play, we talked about it,"" George said. ""I was clueless at that moment. But [Westbrook] told the situation, so it was cool to be on the other end of the triple-double.""
After Westbrook drained the 3, he and George met at midcourt, jumping and celebrating together.
""Nah, no pressure,"" Westbrook said of paying off George's pass to get him the triple-double. ""When it's time to do something for your teammate, for your brother, it's easy for me because I do that each and every night. I do what's best for everybody in this locker room. I put my body on the line and whatever it is needs to be done to make somebody else happy. That's the type of guy I am, and I live by it and I stand by it.""
George has been on his own tear as of late, averaging 39.7 points per game in February. With 45 points against James Harden and the Houston Rockets on Saturday, George has scored 92 points in his past two tilts.
""Everybody is going crazy for Giannis [Antetokounmpo] and James [Harden]. Everybody I probably went up against -- and no disrespect to other teams, they're unbelievable -- Paul is the best that we probably went up against all year,"" Trail Blazers forward Evan Turner said. ""He's at a completely different level. It's hard to even explain.""
Portland All-Star guard Damian Lillard offered a similar take on George.
""He's on a different level,"" Lillard said. ""After watching him over the last 10 games or so -- I catch a lot of their games, and then seeing him tonight -- that dude is MVP. If they keep this up, he's MVP.""
It is the second time this season that teammates have recorded triple-doubles in the same game (LeBron James and Lonzo Ball) and the ninth time in NBA history.
""It was special from the second the ball was tipped off; I don't know, just a really, really good vibe from amongst our team in this building,"" George said. ""Just felt amazing. The energy was awesome.""
Westbrook had two previous streaks of seven straight triple-doubles -- both in his MVP-winning 2016-17 season -- but he finally passed Michael Jordan and his own previous mark last week, then he caught Chamberlain on Saturday at Houston, before setting the new mark on Monday.
Westbrook is the modern triple-double king, breaking Oscar Robertson's mark for most in a season (42) and becoming the first player to average a triple-double for an entire season since Robertson in 1962 (following it up by averaging a triple-double again last season and currently again this season).
Westbrook is third all time on the career triple-double list at 127, just 11 away from Magic Johnson for second all time. Robertson is first with 181.
During Westbrook's streak, the Thunder are 9-1, and he is averaging 19.7 points, 13.2 rebounds and 13.8 assists per game.
""I just go play the game the right way,"" Westbrook said. ""That's what I do. Go out and compete, every night leave it on the floor. And whatever happens, happens. I'm very, very blessed to be able to go out and play, and I don't take it for granted.""

25906911,"Chandler played 21 minutes in Thursday's 113-104 victory, finishing with 8 points, 3 assists and 2 rebounds, before leaving in the third quarter with the injury. While he downplayed the injury after the game, the Sixers will now be without their starting power forward through next Thursday's trade deadline and beyond.
Who are the players and teams to watch as the trade deadline nears? Zach Lowe bounces around the league.
He's expected to be re-evaluated around the All-Star break.
Chandler, who Philadelphia acquired from the Denver Nuggets last summer using cap space, has already missed a handful of games this season even before this latest injury. He is averaging a career-low 6.7 points in 36 games this season, including 32 starts.
Philadelphia is in the midst of the hardest stretch of its schedule this season. Saturday's game against the Sacramento Kings is the Sixers' eighth -- having won five of the first seven -- in a stretch of 12 straight games against teams with winning records.

25983796,"After the Boston Celtics suffered a disappointing home loss to the LA Clippers on Saturday night -- a second straight game that saw Boston surrender a double-digit lead before going on to lose outright -- forward Marcus Morris decided he had some things to say.
""For me it's not really about the loss,"" Morris told reporters. ""It's about the attitudes that we're playing with. Guys are hanging their heads. It's just not fun. It's not fun. We're not competing at a high level. Even though we're winning, it's not fun. I don't see the joy in the game.
""I watch all these other teams around the league and guys are up on the bench, they're jumping on the court, they're doing all of this other stuff that looks like they're enjoying their teammates' success, they're enjoying everything, and they're playing together and they're playing to win. And when I look at us, I just see a bunch of individuals.""
And, just like that, the Celtics were plunged back into their latest state of full-on panic.
At least, that was the case until the Celtics -- without Kyrie Irving -- won on back-to-back nights in Philadelphia against the new-look 76ers and at home against the Detroit Pistons to head into the All-Star break on a high note.
Executive produced by Kevin Durant, The Boardroom will explore the most fascinating trends and innovative endeavors across the business of sports, featuring conversations with athletes, executives and business titans. Watch on ESPN+
This cycle, as topsy-turvy as it seems, perfectly encapsulates the way Boston's season has played out: Win a few games, and look like things are getting on track. Subsequently lose a game or two, allowing all hell to break loose. Then do it all over again.
It has been what has made this season so confusing not just for the Celtics, but for everyone -- from the media to the fans to other teams around the league -- trying to process just what this team will become. It also is why, with 24 games left before the playoffs, the Celtics -- despite all they have endured thus far -- should still be considered a force to be reckoned with once they get there.
Given the amount of drama that has surrounded the Celtics, it's easy to forget they still are on pace to win 52 games, and finish with home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. But given the expectations put upon them before the season, the fact Boston has lagged behind the Milwaukee Bucks and Toronto Raptors -- and, until the past couple of days, the 76ers, too -- has added to the underwhelming feelings surrounding this squad.
Boston's internal dynamics haven't helped. When a team has its own frustrations spill out into the public sphere as often as the Celtics have this season, it's hard for those outside of the team to take a longer view.
Over the course of an 82-game season, every team has moments when it gets frustrated. In Boston this season, though, it feels as though every loss has become its own existential crisis for the Celtics, and their fans, to deal with. The outburst from Morris following Saturday's loss was far from the first time Boston's players have had harsh words about their own play.
Irving is easily having his best individual season, but he has repeatedly taken aim at the team's younger players for not buying in to what needs to be done for the Celtics to have success. The younger players, meanwhile, (mainly Terry Rozier, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown) have at times bristled at Irving's criticism -- including, on some occasions, firing back through the media. Gordon Hayward's understandably uneven progress in his return from last season's gruesome leg and ankle injuries hasn't helped, as it has sapped away minutes and touches from those same young players who led the Celtics to within a few possessions of the NBA Finals last season.
Hayward goes through an extensive debriefing of the state of his game, and his recovery, after just about every game, with good performances signaling him turning a corner and bad ones highlighting how far he has to go. After close to three-quarters of a season of those, he's (also understandably) ready to be done having to go through daily discussions of his injury.
Meanwhile, all of that took a back seat over the past few weeks to the insufferable drama surrounding Anthony Davis, and whether he'd be traded by last week's trade deadline or whether he'd be available for Boston, which can't trade for him until Irving agrees to a new contract this summer.
The constant chatter of the Celtics having the most assets to send out in a Davis trade -- including not just draft picks, but young talent such as Tatum and Brown -- wore on the team. It arguably wore on Irving more than anyone else, as he showed during an interview session in New York on Feb. 1 when he cast doubt on his future in Boston.
""At the end of the day, I'm going to do what's best for my career, and that's just where it stands. That's just where it stands,"" Irving said. ""And my focus this season is winning a championship with the Boston Celtics. Obviously, we had goals coming into the season, and the primary goal is to win a championship. So that's where my focus is.""
When pressed further about his prior commitment to re-sign with the Celtics, Irving simply said, ""Ask me July 1.""
Jalen Rose says that this is the last season Kyrie Irving will be in a Celtics uniform, even though Boston will be worse without him.
But Davis wasn't traded, and now the Celtics have become the favorites to get the superstar forward. If they do, they expect to be able to pair him with Irving for years to come.
In the meantime, Boston still has aspirations of making it out of the Eastern Conference and back to the NBA Finals for the first time in almost a decade. For all of their very public issues this season, when the Celtics have played against top competition, they have looked every bit of the contender they were billed. In matchups with the Bucks, Raptors and Sixers so far this season, Boston is a combined 6-2 -- including 3-0 against Philadelphia after Boston won there Tuesday night with Irving sidelined because of a knee injury.
Toronto, meanwhile, is 5-6, and Philadelphia is a dismal 1-7.
""Good teams have clunkers, but good teams respond to those with the right effort and approach,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said after Tuesday's win in Philadelphia. ""That was a good one. ... I just thought the whole night we played the right way.""
After the Bucks (Nikola Mirotic), Raptors (Marc Gasol and Jeremy Lin) and Sixers (Tobias Harris) have made significant upgrades both prior to the NBA's trade deadline and in the buyout market, Boston is by no means a favorite to get through the Eastern Conference playoffs. But despite the Celtics failing to make a similar deadline upgrade -- instead continuing to hoard their assets for a run at Davis this summer -- they still easily have enough to remain a threat.
The Boston Celtics will be without both of their point guards -- Kyrie Irving and Terry Rozier -- in Wednesday's game against the Detroit Pistons.
They have a clear formula to win in May and June: Keep the game close until the closing minutes, and then let Irving -- arguably the best closer in the game today -- carry them home. That same formula already has provided several of those wins for the Celtics against their competitors atop the East this season.
And Tuesday's win in Philadelphia without Irving -- in which Al Horford and Hayward led Boston to the victory -- served as yet another reminder that the Celtics are going to need both of those veterans to be consistently playing that way if they want to fulfill their ambitions and reach the NBA Finals.
The Celtics will now take a week to rest and recharge before returning from the break for a showdown with the East-leading Bucks in Milwaukee to begin their 24-game run to the playoffs. Boston has already gone through so much that it seems hard to believe that much time is left in its regular season. But, despite it all, everything the Celtics were expected to do when this season began is still possible.
Now they just have to do it.

25969849,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry had a message for Dwyane Wade following the Warriors' 120-118 win over Wade's Miami Heat on Sunday.
Why are you retiring now?
As has been custom during Wade's farewell tour this season, the Heat guard exchanged jerseys with a player from the opposing team. On Sunday, that player was Curry.
No matter where he spends the rest of his career, Kevin Durant is determined to set himself up for success for the rest of his life.
Dwyane Wade knows something about superteams, and believes the addition of DeMarcus Cousins makes the Warriors' starting five perhaps the best the NBA has seen.
The Knicks used an image of rookie center Mitchell Robinson playing alongside Golden State's Kevin Durant in a pitch to season-ticket holders, then deleted the picture.
""It seems like he's got a lot more in the tank,"" Curry said. ""That's what I told him after the game. 'Are you sure? I know you got a lot of stuff going on off the court with your family and stuff. Are you sure you don't have a couple more years left in there?' Obviously, with him going to every road arena one more time, it's a different energy for sure.""
Wade, who finished with 10 points, received a nice ovation from the Oracle Arena crowd after a short video tribute was played on the video screen. Wade waved to the crowd in appreciation as highlights from his career played.
""Everywhere he's gone, you watch on TV,"" Curry said. ""It's a different energy when he gets the ball. You understand how important he's been to the game throughout his career. No matter who you root for throughout the league, you respect greatness in terms of what he's been able to do throughout his entire career. Tonight wasn't a loud night [in terms of performance], but he had some pretty influential plays.""
Curry's comments echoed those of many Warriors players and coaches who were appreciative of the production Wade, 37, has displayed in his 16-year career.
""Everything he has done for that organization, it's been amazing,"" Warriors forward Draymond Green said. ""And yet he's still out there this year playing well. It's good to see a guy, I think if you looked at D-Wade three years ago, you kind of worried, like, 'Ahh is it over?' And he's battled back from that, and it's good to see a guy who's great as D-Wade was close out on a strong note. The way he's playing this year, it's great to see him go out like that. You kind of hate to see a guy limp out of the game, and there are some kids that will see some of these older guys and be like, 'Oh man, he sucked.' No, if you knew that guy five years ago, like -- but that's just the nature of the business we're in. However, like I said, I think D-Wade is playing amazing this year. It's good to see him go out on a high note.""
Warriors star Kevin Durant echoed similar sentiments.
""I'm not surprised,"" he said of Wade's upcoming retirement. ""I wouldn't be surprised either way if he would have kept playing or if he would have retired. He's done and experienced so much in this league, and he's been really good as an older guy with all the younger guys as well. So I think he's invested so much into basketball spiritually and physically that it's just time to walk away and pursue what's next in his life. As a hooper from day one, I can appreciate that about D-Wade, especially battling him in the Finals and throughout my whole career. It's good to see guys go out the way they want to.""
For his part, Wade was appreciative of the ovation he received from the Bay Area crowd and seemed to enjoy his last trip to Oracle.
""It was great, man,"" he said. ""It was amazing. They really put some thought into that. Afterward, I said to my teammates that it was dope. It was a great tribute. I appreciate Steve Kerr and the Golden State organization and the fans for the ovation. It was a fun environment to play in.""

25925639,"As trade talks pick up between the Los Angeles Lakers and New Orleans Pelicans, LaVar Ball said he does not want to see son Lonzo Ball in New Orleans.
The Lakers have improved their offer to the Pelicans for Anthony Davis, but New Orleans has been made aware of a ""handful"" of teams Davis would be willing to sign with outside of the Lakers or Knicks.
""We want to be in L.A.,"" LaVar Ball told ESPN. ""But if he's traded, I don't want Lonzo in New Orleans. Phoenix is the best fit for him. And I am going to speak it into existence.""
As Thursday's trade deadline rapidly approaches, the Lakers are pursuing Anthony Davis, and ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Lakers are offering the Pelicans multiple young players, including Ball, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma, to go with draft picks and salary-cap relief.
The elder Ball wants the point guard, drafted second overall by the Lakers in 2017, to remain a Laker. He starred in high school at Chino Hills before playing one year at UCLA. But if Ball is going to be traded, LaVar Ball said he would rather see his son in Phoenix, where the Suns have been playing shooting guard Devin Booker at point guard. The Suns rank 17th in assists this season as they've tried different players at point guard. New Orleans has Jrue Holiday at the point.
In addition to having Booker as the franchise's star, Phoenix selected center Deandre Ayton with the top pick overall in last year's draft. Phoenix could be helped by an athletic, pass-first point guard like Ball.
The Suns' starting point guards average 8.6 points per game, the fewest among starting point guards in the league. That number drops to 6.9 points per game and 3.6 assists per game when taking out the games Booker started at point guard.
Ball has missed the past six games with a Grade 3 ankle sprain that will keep him out until late February at the earliest. He's averaging 9.9 points, 5.4 assists and 5.3 rebounds per game in his second season.

25975382,"TORONTO -- Jonas Valanciunas had been one of the faces of the Toronto Raptors the past several years. The gregarious, giant Lithuanian became a fan favorite as a mainstay of Toronto's rise from Eastern Conference afterthought to perennial power.
Valanciunas is a nice player, just like the Raptors had become a nice team. But in firing Dwane Casey and trading DeMar DeRozan for Kawhi Leonard, Raptors president of basketball operations Masai Ujiri made it clear that the days of settling for being a nice team with nice guys were over.
In the hours leading up to Thursday's trade deadline, Ujiri made his final push into the center of the table, sending Valanciunas, Delon Wright, CJ Miles and a second-round pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Marc Gasol.
In an eight-minute stretch to open the fourth quarter of his first home game with his new team, Gasol showed Toronto exactly why that was a move the Raptors had to make. By the time it was over, he'd gone 5-for-5 from the floor, scoring 11 points with two assists, another pass leading to a pair of free throws and a couple of key defensive stops in a 127-125 win over the Brooklyn Nets.
""I definitely got more comfortable,"" Gasol said. ""There are obviously a few things I can do at both ends of the floor.""
He did all of them in those eight minutes to start the fourth. It was a stretch of Gasol at his very best -- and an example of how he could be what puts Toronto over the top amid the bloodbath that will be the final two rounds of the Eastern Conference playoffs.
""It was pretty good, right?"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse asked with a smile.
It certainly was. It's that version of Gasol that the Raptors are going to need on a regular basis this spring if they want to make good on the message Ujiri was sending his team with both the moves he made last summer and the one he made to get Gasol on Thursday.
Being nice is no longer good enough. Being good is no longer good enough. For this to be a successful season for Toronto -- a team hoping to convince Leonard to stick around as a free agent this summer -- only making it to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history is going to be good enough.
The Raptors know that, too -- just as they know it won't be easy. They saw the Milwaukee Bucks (Nikola Mirotic) and Philadelphia 76ers (Tobias Harris) make deals at the deadline, and the Boston Celtics remain a threat -- even with their recent issues. All of that played a part in Toronto's chasing and landing Gasol, who looked like a man motivated by his new surroundings after spending the past few months mired in Memphis with a team going nowhere.
""Without a doubt,"" he said Monday morning when asked if the trade to a contender had given him a fresh jolt of energy. ""Obviously.""
Even before adding Gasol, though, the Raptors had been impressive this season, going 42-16 thus far -- good for the second-best record in the Eastern Conference and third in the NBA -- despite having played only two games with a full roster at their disposal.
The first time came Nov. 2 in Phoenix. The second came Saturday in New York against the Knicks -- after the team shed five players in about two hours leading up to the trade deadline.
The third such game won't be coming anytime soon after the Raptors announced Wednesday that Fred VanVleet will be out for at least the next three weeks with a partial ligament injury in his left thumb.
""Well, it's part of it,"" Nurse said of Toronto's myriad injury issues this season. ""I don't know if [it will], but I always try to keep a positive attitude that these things balance themselves out.
""We've been a little bit on the unbalanced side here going in, and maybe we'll be balanced just at the right time.""
Raptors guard Fred VanVleet will miss at least three weeks with a partially torn ligament in his left thumb. The team says VanVleet will wear a splint for approximately three weeks before the injury is re-evaluated.
Agents for Hawks guard Jeremy Lin told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski that a buyout with Atlanta is expected to be completed as soon as Monday, and Lin could sign with the Toronto Raptors by midweek.
Who wins this big trade? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
The Raptors would gladly trade a season full of injuries if it meant a guarantee of health come playoff time. (Narrator: That isn't how this works.)
In the interim, it was rather fortuitous that the Raptors agreed to a deal with guard Jeremy Lin once he clears waivers Wednesday afternoon, after Lin agreed to a buyout with the Atlanta Hawks. Lin has never quite reached the heights he hit during the peak days of Linsanity with the New York Knicks in 2012, which included his buzzer-beater to beat the Raptors in Toronto seven years ago this week. But he has carved out a good career for himself, thanks to the skill that led to his breakout: his ability to operate in the pick-and-roll.
Toronto's acquiring Lin, as well as Gasol, provides this team an influx of playmaking it can use. The Raptors would've liked to add more, but they missed out on wing shooter Wayne Ellington, who signed with Detroit to get more money and more minutes.
Even when playing at their best this season, the Raptors have often looked like two teams, playing one way when Kawhi Leonard is on the court and playing another when he isn't. Adding another pair of creative, offensive players such as Lin and Gasol should help balance those differences and allow the Raptors to keep the ball humming and the offense moving the way their coach prefers.
""I'm an unselfish player by nature,"" Gasol said. ""When I see a pass and somebody open, regardless of who it is, I'm going to throw it to them and keep encouraging guys to keep moving and moving without the ball. Because if they get behind their defender or their defender makes a mistake, we're going to make them pay for it.""
Executive produced by Kevin Durant, The Boardroom will explore the most fascinating trends and innovative endeavors across the business of sports, featuring conversations with athletes, executives and business titans. Watch on ESPN+
Gasol's arrival, though, creates more questions. Namely: Who will start? In the first two games since the Gasol deal, Toronto kept what has become its consistent starting five of Kyle Lowry, Danny Green, Leonard, Pascal Siakam and Serge Ibaka. That, however, will start to change -- beginning Wednesday against the Washington Wizards or, as is more likely, next week after the All-Star break.
Gasol could replace Ibaka in some matchups, as Toronto did with Valanciunas earlier this season. There also is a good chance Nurse will, at some point, try to go with a super big lineup, featuring Leonard at shooting guard, Siakam at small forward, Ibaka at power forward and Gasol at center (a lineup other East teams have said they won't mind seeing).
Regardless, the Raptors need to get their current starting group going. When Toronto got off to its hot start to begin the season, those starters went 14-2 in the 16 games they played together and outscored teams by 16.1 points per 100 possessions in 234 minutes on the court.
Since then, that group is 7-5 in 12 games and is being outscored by 3.3 points per 100 possessions in 245 minutes, including being outscored by four points in 25 minutes Monday. Whether it's fatigue (Toronto has played the most games in the NBA thus far), the injuries or some combination of the two, the Raptors need that to change.
""I think we got one eye a little bit on the [All-Star] break a little bit,"" Nurse said. ""I think they've played a lot of games and a lot of minutes. We need to get them a little bit juiced up. We're talking about it, too. We're trying to get some more movement in the start, maybe even scripting some plays to make sure we're moving because we'll stand around a little bit.
""That's a veteran group. Four of them are long-time vets that can get to be slow-moving at times and Pascal running around by himself. We just have to keep an eye on it and keep them fresh and energized.""
The upcoming break should help. The addition of Gasol should, too. Toronto will need the boost if it wants to escape the East and live up to the promise Ujiri's ambitions have created.
Being nice is no longer good enough. The Raptors hope what they are now is.

25956294,"PHOENIX -- For the second straight season, Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James used the first pick in the All-Star draft to select Golden State Warriors superstar Kevin Durant for his team. For the second straight year, Durant wasn't surprised at all.
""What else is he supposed to do?"" Durant said after Friday's 117-107 Warriors win over the Phoenix Suns.
Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Kevin Durant deserves a pass for his emotional news conference, and that, as a star in the league's ""soap opera,"" KD was ""just blowing off some steam.""
The exchange came toward the end of a cordial and professional four-minute news conference between Durant and reporters, which is notable given that following a Wednesday night win over the San Antonio Spurs, the usually media-friendly Durant aired his frustrations with some recent stories about his potential future with the New York Knicks and admitted that he didn't trust anyone in the media.
Durant, who is regarded as one of the most accessible stars in the game, answered questions and then spent a few minutes visiting with Suns guard Devin Booker after his postgame responsibilities were finished. Warriors teammate DeMarcus Cousins credited Durant with always being able to play at a high level on the floor, no matter what kind of distractions he was dealing with off of it.
""It's a credit to his mental toughness,"" Cousins said. ""I don't think he gets enough credit for how much bulls--- he deals with on the daily. He has his personal life. He's probably top-two, top-three guys in the league when it comes to ... just dealing with media -- him, Bron, maybe Steph [Curry].
""It's a tough life -- always having a camera in your face, never really having privacy -- and it's obvious how much he gets attacked just on the social media and from a fan standpoint. He deals with a lot, he has a lot coming at him, and he's still able to block that out and come out and produce on a nightly basis. So that's a credit to him. Like I said, I don't feel he gets enough credit for it.""
Durant finished the game with 21 points, 8 rebounds and 3 assists as the Warriors won for the 14th time in their past 15 games. As for the All-Star Game, Durant took a few playful shots at Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, the other captain in next Sunday's showcase game in Charlotte.
""Giannis is not from here,"" Durant said. ""So I understand next year he'll be better picking his team.""
Curry, who was Antetokounmpo's first pick, said he was looking forward to going up against teammates Durant and Klay Thompson.
""It's going to be like training camp practice type when you're on the second team every once in a while,"" Curry said. ""It will be fun. I'll probably have to guard him at some point. Hopefully I'll know their moves and be able to figure it out.""

25934645,"Amid all the Anthony Davis talk, the Lakers dealt guard Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and a second-round draft pick to the Detroit Pistons for guard Reggie Bullock.
Who wins this deal? Kevin Pelton grades the trade.
Tuesday's 42-point loss to the Pacers was the worst defeat in a game LeBron James has played in during his 16-year NBA career.
Lakers management, feeling like they are starting to bid against themselves, insist they'll add nothing more to an existing offer to the Pelicans for star Anthony Davis, sources told ESPN.
The deal gives LeBron James & Co. a much-needed 3-point threat.
Bullock, 27, is in his fourth season with the Pistons, averaging 12 points and shooting 38 percent on 6.6 3-point attempts per game.
According to Second Spectrum, Bullock is shooting 39.8 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers this season. That would rank first among Lakers players with at least 50 catch-and-shoot 3s.
Detroit will create a $2.5 million trade exception with the deal. Bullock is in the final year of his contract, and the Lakers will inherit his Bird rights this summer.
Mykhailiuk, 21, was drafted by the Lakers with the 47th pick last year, and he is in the first year of a three-year, $4.6 million contract. The Pistons have until July 5 to guarantee his $1.4 million contract for the 2019-20 season. The former Kansas star is averaging 3 points in 10.7 minutes per game this season.
The NBA's trade deadline is Thursday at 3 p.m. ET.
The Lakers have been in talks with the New Orleans Pelicans about Davis, the All-Star center. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Tuesday that Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson wants the Pelicans to start making counterproposals to offers on Davis, threatening to end talks unless New Orleans shows a willingness to engage in a back-and-forth on reaching a deal.
The Athletic first reported the Lakers and Pistons were nearing an agreement on the Bullock deal.

25902818,"There are really two separate NBA trade deadlines: the Anthony Davis/Kyrie Irving/LeBron James/Kristaps Porzingis nexus of superstar drama, and everyone else trying to do normal trade deadline things.
The superstar nexus will get even frothier in July. An underrated subplot: How teams fare in the postseason could have an unusual impact on superstar free agency. At least one of Philadelphia (Jimmy Butler), Boston (Irving), and Toronto (Kawhi Leonard) will lose before the conference finals. How will those star free agents react? What happens if catastrophe strikes Golden State (Klay Thompson, and more notably, Kevin Durant)?
Let's bounce around the rest of the league:
• We know the Hawks, Cavaliers, Bulls, and Grizzlies are selling their veterans with the zeal of Crazy Eddie. We know the Pelicans have been forced into holding trade talks for a future Hall of Famer; they have also made Nikola Mirotic, Julius Randle and E'Twaun Moore available, sources have told ESPN. We know that Bradley Beal, Kemba Walker, and Otto Porter Jr. probably aren't available, though Porter has drawn preliminary interest over the past few months from Utah, Portland, Dallas, and some other buyers, per league sources.
So which teams might swing the market?
• Some within the Magic -- their coach, Steve Clifford, and higher-ups who predate the Jeff Weltman/John Hammond front office -- are desperate to make the playoffs. Weltman and Hammond probably don't feel the same urgency; only the past two seasons are on their watch, and they appear to have a long runway. They are also five games out in the loss column.
They would likely deal Terrence Ross for a future asset, though it's unclear if they can snag even a heavily-protected first-round pick for him. (Two second-rounders might end up being the price.) They would demand much more for Nikola Vucevic, an All-Star heading toward a massive new contract. They face two alternatives in July: lose Vucevic for nothing, or pay him a giant amount to man the position they hope Mo Bamba assumes during the life of Vucevic's next deal. Given those parameters, they have to consider trading him.Editor's PicksLowe Post: Dirk on Porzingis and LukaZach talks to Dirk Nowitzki about the Porzingis trade, Luka Mania, and the highs and lows of his career.Lowe: Ten things I like and don't like, including Boogie's grooveThis week we highlight Philly making it work, Devin Booker's passing woes and All-Star snubs.1 Related
Zach talks to Dirk Nowitzki about the Porzingis trade, Luka Mania, and the highs and lows of his career.
This week we highlight Philly making it work, Devin Booker's passing woes and All-Star snubs.
As I've written before, Vucevic for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the Lakers' first-round pick -- potentially a late lottery pick -- is among my very favorite hypothetical deals. (So is Ross for Markelle Fultz, though it's unclear if the Magic might have to toss in something extra -- a second-rounder -- to make that happen. Fultz's trade value, like his injury, is a total mystery.)
The Magic might turn their noses up at receiving a middling first-round pick for their best player. The league as a whole has no feel for Weltman's plan. I'm not sure Orlando will get much better than that sort of pick and perhaps one other asset.
That raises the possibility they simply keep Vucevic. He just turned 28. Bamba is not ready; the Magic over the last month have split up Bamba and Jonathan Isaac because teams are destroying Orlando with those two on the floor.
I'd bet against a Vucevic deal, though the Magic's recent slide should have them more interested in selling than they were two weeks ago.
• A player-centric version of this question that is fun to bat around with executives and agents: Who might be available -- or at least gettable -- that we don't expect? I keep coming back to Aaron Gordon. The Magic designed his descending contract to make him ultra-tradable. Like Vucevic, he just doesn't fit a long-term vision that has Bamba and Isaac starting.
The Pacers sniffed around an offer sheet for Gordon. Utah could use one more infusion of talent. How fun would a Gordon-John Collins frontline look in Atlanta? Would Portland gamble on Gordon's long-term fit next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum? (They almost certainly wouldn't trade McCollum straight up for Gordon.)
The Blazers love Al-Farouq Aminu. They would aim to keep him. Aminu fits best at power forward -- Gordon's position. Then again, is there really a difference between a Maurice Harkless-Aminu forward combination and a Gordon-Aminu pairing? What about the Spurs? Dallas investigated Gordon's availability before the Porzingis deal, sources have said.
Gordon would mark a bold play for someone. But the Magic need him to stay competitive. They know his trade value will only increase as his contract declines and the salary cap rises.
• Portland stands a potential buyer -- an under-the-radar really good team with questions about its postseason viability. The Trail Blazers have put their first-round pick in play, per sources around the league. They have investigated Porter's availability. Taurean Prince makes some sense; he's up for an extension this summer, and the Hawks have made him available, sources say. As a free agent non-destination, the Blazers value players whose rights they can control.
But the Hawks are asking a lot so far -- a young player and a pick -- and haven't gotten much traction on Prince trades, sources say.
Another off-the-beaten path name from Orlando: Evan Fournier -- a wing who could give Portland or some other team some shooting and playmaking. He has two years and $34 million left on his contract; if the Magic aren't thrilled with that deal, they could suss out his value.
• Portland is also over the tax. Can the Blazers somehow improve their team and cut their current year's tax bill? Keep an eye on the Raptors making a move to trim their tax bill if they can find one that doesn't hurt their team.
• Charlotte will be over the tax next season as things stand now if they re-sign Kemba Walker, and it seems wildly implausible Michael Jordan will pay the tax for a mediocre team. Their ideal scenario is improving their current team and somehow trimming next season's tax bill. Good luck!
They have long been perhaps the most obvious fit for Marc Gasol, but it's unclear if they can send out enough bad long-term contracts -- to Memphis and/or a third team -- to make a deal.
There has not been much buzz about Gasol, though he is hoping for a trade, sources familiar with the matter say. Teams are waiting to see if the Grizzlies' asking price drops a bit, sources say. Memphis has not shown any real interest yet in Andre Drummond, sources say. Detroit might be saving other trade chips for someone else. Gasol's $26 million player option for next season brings a lot of uncertainty for any interested party.
• A ton of teams are set up to have major cap space this summer. Some of those teams are in markets with zero history of drawing A-level stars. The good teams among that group should think hard about cannibalizing some of that cap space now in deals that add good players.
The best current example: Utah's interest in Mike Conley, which is very real, sources say. Utah can build an offer around Ricky Rubio and Derrick Favors -- both on effectively expiring contracts -- and a lightly-protected future first-round pick. That is going to be Memphis' floor.
Utah would forfeit a max salary slot in that deal. They could still have significant room depending on a few other variables, but probably not enough to add even a second-tier free agent such as Khris Middleton or Tobias Harris. (The Jazz would have interest in Harris if they save space, per league sources.)
Memphis wants more than two veterans who can walk in a few months, plus a pick in the 20s, sources say. (One caveat: Memphis could try and flip Favors and Rubio for picks if they get them with enough time to spare before the deadline.) Utah can sweeten the pot with one of Dante Exum and Grayson Allen.
Utah is really good, and one upgrade from being potentially great. Rubio to Conley is one such upgrade. But there will always be some overlap in skill, and maybe some diminishing returns, pairing Donovan Mitchell with a ball-dominant point guard. Conley's 3-point shooting eases those concerns.2019 NBA trade deadlineWe've got you covered on the biggest deals going down at the NBA trade deadline.• All the trades, grades and intel

We've got you covered on the biggest deals going down at the NBA trade deadline.

• Trade tracker: Details on every move
• Davis is still a Pelican -- now what? 
• What's next for Markelle Fultz in Orlando?
• How good are the Raptors with Gasol?
• Trade machine: You be the GM
But an upgrade on the wing or at power forward brings more pop. I doubt Utah throws in a second first-round pick, so Conley talks could pivot on Exum. Utah might be holding firm on its floor offer (no Exum), betting no one beats it. The Jazz might be proven right. This weekend will be interesting.
• If Conley proves too pricey, the Jazz could move onto a cheaper rental -- someone like Mirotic.
• The same cap reasoning made Indiana an appealing Conley suitor before Victor Oladipo's season-ending injury: Who is Indiana signing in free agency that is better than Conley? (One potential answer, sources say: Middleton. But luring a good player away from a contending team like the Bucks is really hard unless Milwaukee gets too cute in negotiations with Middleton.) You could argue Oladipo's injury, and what it does to Indiana's playoff hopes, shouldn't really alter their plans -- even amid a losing streak. If they wanted Conley before they should want him now for the same reason: He sets them up to be very good next season.
Building an offer is tricky. To make the money work, Indiana can really offer only expiring contracts, and all of the movable ones are linked to primary ball handlers: Darren Collison, Cory Joseph, and Tyreke Evans. (The Pacers want to re-sign Bojan Bogdanovic, also working on an expiring contract, sources say.) They could toss in their 2019 first-round pick, but that might not be of much interest to the Grizzlies.
Adding Aaron Holiday gets you close -- and maybe all the way there -- but it also costs yet another ball handler. They could find a third team to supply some matching salary, so they could keep one of those point guards. In any case, the current buzz is that Indiana has stepped away from Conley talks, sources say.
• The Grizzlies probably would ask for Domantas Sabonis, and the Pacers don't appear ready to go there. I do think Indiana will eventually have to choose between Sabonis and Myles Turner. I'm not sure they will ever mesh quite well enough for Indiana to play them the sort of heavy minutes together -- like, say, 20-plus per game -- that would justify paying them something like $40 million combined per season. (Sabonis will be up for an extension this summer, and you can bet he wants -- and deserves -- a monster deal.)
Both should remain positive trade assets. Turner's four-year, $72 million extension already looks like a tidy deal. I don't expect a deal at the deadline, but you can never rule it out. Teams sometimes sell high before we expect it.
• Detroit remains my favorite Conley team, though Memphis would likely have to swallow Reggie Jackson's contract -- or reroute him to a third team -- to snare one or two nice assets from the Pistons (perhaps a lightly-protected first-round pick and one of Detroit's young wings.)
The teams have talked, but not gotten far, sources say. It's unclear if there are any other serious bidders. Everyone around the Conley sweepstakes expects it to heat up over the weekend.
• Some of Miami's veterans on long-term deals once fit this conceit, but most of the guys they'd be willing to move for some relief -- i.e., not Justise Winslow, Josh Richardson or Bam Adebayo -- have underwhelmed. Given their glut of rotation guys -- Wayne Ellington, essential last season, was out of the rotation until recently -- I'd expect Miami to try to recoup at least a second-round pick for someone who isn't playing as much as he'd like.
• Dallas was super-active before going all-in for Porzingis. The move carries enormous risk beyond Porzingis' injury history. Dallas will hold its own pick only every other year for at least the next half-decade. They ate way into their cap space. How are they going to build around Luka Doncic and Porzingis?
In a way, this trade is a bald admission from the Mavericks that they have botched or ignored both the draft and free agency for most of the past 15 years. (For a while there, Roddy Beaubois was the crown jewel of their post-Dirk first-round picks.) Why bother with tools that don't work all that well for you? But those are two of the three pathways toward team building. The other is trading players. But what do the Mavs have left to trade?
That's why I'm keeping an eye on both Harrison Barnes and Dwight Powell over the next few days. Dallas right now has about $99 million in salary committed for next season -- leaving the Mavs only $10 million in room. Barnes and Powell both hold player options for 2019-20: Barnes for $25 million, Powell for about $10.3 million. The Mavs will have a couple of windows to try free agency again before both Doncic and Porzingis cycle onto massive new contracts. (By the way: I'll believe Porzingis takes his one-year qualifying offer when I see it. Pure posturing.)
Unloading Barnes or Powell for an expiring contract would open up another such free agency window this summer. The Mavericks have sniffed around Barnes deals, including the possibility of flipping him for Otto Porter -- a move that would effectively work as a free agency signing, sources say. But that was before the Porzingis stunner, and Washington doesn't appear to have had any interest, sources say.NBA Trade Machine: You be the GMCould your team land a superstar?

• JaMychal Green, Justin Holiday, and Garrett Temple are all available, per league sources. The Grizz would surely like to recoup at least one of the second-rounders they flipped for Holiday.
• The Kings are still sitting there with the only meaningful chunk of cap room left -- about $11 million -- waiting to use it to pick up an asset, sources say. That could be a pick. It could be a player who helps them now. The Kings are so far trying to thread the needle: stay competitive in case they pull off a run for the No. 8 seed without taking on money beyond this season.
They haven't shown nearly as much interest in Gasol as has been reported, per league sources. They have a package that makes sense -- Willie Cauley-Stein, salary filler, and a future first-round pick -- but I don't get the sense the Kings are willing to part with a pick for Gasol. They already owe this season's pick to Boston. Gasol is an odd fit for their turbo style. His $26.5 million player option looms.
There are non-stars on long-term deals the Kings like enough to sacrifice future space. Porter has been one such player, per league sources. If they don't find one, they might step back and use their space to act as a facilitator.
• The Kings are willing to talk about Cauley-Stein separately, sources say. He's a restricted free agent this summer. Sacramento could bail if the market goes above a certain price point. (He shouldn't have that kind of market, but you never know.) In that case, they should search out what they could get for him now. Marvin Bagley III and Harry Giles are coming.
• Cleveland will keep trying to sell Alec Burks and any other indispensable asset until the buzzer. They are willing to take on more dead money for picks. Houston will peddle a future first-round pick attached to Marquese Chriss and Brandon Knight until the buzzer. The league might be devaluing Houston's future first-rounders -- Chris Paul is 33 and hurt all the time -- but the Rockets would surely push to slap lottery protection on picks stretching beyond James Harden's prime.
Houston has discussed sending Knight and a pick for Burks, but those talks have quieted, sources say. They will also monitor the buyout market. Houston still has about $3.9 million of its taxpayer midlevel exception to spend, giving the Rockets a potential leg there.
• The Bulls will listen to offers for anyone other than Lauri Markkanen and Wendell Carter Jr., sources say -- and that includes Kris Dunn and Zach LaVine. The biggest question about Chicago going into the season was whether any of their main ball handlers -- Dunn, LaVine, and Jabari Parker when the Bulls were pretending he was a wing -- would emerge as someone who could orchestrate an above-average NBA offense. The answer has been an emphatic no. I would not bet on Dunn or LaVine getting dealt; they are still young, the Bulls would ask for a ton, and they need, like, some guards on next season's team. But any rival enamored with them should call.
• I still think the Clippers should at least see what they could get for one of their veterans -- Patrick Beverley, Avery Bradley, maybe even Lou Williams. (They could 100 percent nab a future first-round pick for Williams.) They are making and taking calls like everyone else, but do not appear motivated to do much of anything, sources say. Again: We still have five-plus days. But the Clippers are deep enough that they could trade a veteran for something and not really hurt their current team.
Other teams have called about Tobias Harris, but the Clips have so far shown no inclination to deal him, sources say. They would happily re-sign him if July goes a certain way for them.
• All is quiet in Denver. The Nuggets have two sizable trade exceptions, and can take on $5 to $7 million without bumping back into the tax. They are open for business for smaller salary dumps if it helps two other teams make a deal, sources say.

25980977,"The NBA found that there was no tampering violation by Los Angeles Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson in relation to potential contact with Philadelphia 76ers point guard Ben Simmons.
""We have concluded that Magic Johnson's statements regarding Ben Simmons do not constitute a tampering violation,"" the NBA said Tuesday in a statement. ""The Philadelphia 76ers initiated the contact with the Los Angeles Lakers by requesting a meeting between Johnson and Simmons. Both organizations ultimately concluded that such a meeting did not make sense at this time but in that context, Johnson's response to a media inquiry regarding Simmons does not run afoul of league rules.""
Sixers general manager Elton Brand called Johnson on Monday afternoon to apologize for insinuating in a radio interview that the Lakers had called -- unprompted -- to ask permission for Johnson to speak with Simmons, league sources told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne.
In the interview with 97.5 The Fanatic on Monday morning, Brand said, ""[Lakers GM] Rob Pelinka called me and said that Ben [Simmons] wanted to talk to Hall of Famers after the season, Magic was on the list. He asked for authorization. ... I said no.""
He did not mention in that interview that someone from the Sixers had contacted Pelinka first, which is what prompted his call to Brand.
The Lakers issued a statement later Monday that read: ""To clarify, last November the 76ers sent an email to the Lakers asking if Ben Simmons would be able to speak with Magic Johnson about his Hall of Fame playing career. After receiving the email request from the 76ers, Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka contacted 76ers General Manager Elton Brand and informed him that Magic could only do so if the 76ers gave him pre-written approval. That was the end of the matter.""
NBA spokesman Mike Bass told ESPN on Monday: ""The league office is looking into whether any contact took place between Ben Simmons and the Los Angeles Lakers that violated NBA rules.""

Ellington, who cleared waivers Saturday afternoon, was one of the top available players in the post-trade-deadline buyout market.
The Pistons released forward Henry Ellenson to clear the roster spot for Ellington, who was waived by the Phoenix Suns after they acquired him in a trade with the Miami Heat.
The Pistons sold Ellington on taking a bulk of the playing time that opened up with the trade of Reggie Bullock to the Lakers, allowing him a chance to showcase his talent for summer free agency.
The 31-year-old guard averaged 8.4 points in 21.3 minutes per game for the Heat this season, both slightly above his career averages.
"
25982867,"Thomas, who was upgraded to questionable for the Nuggets game against Sacramento in Denver, will make a determination about playing earlier in the day on Wednesday, league sources said. Thomas practiced five-on-five again on Tuesday with the Nuggets.
Thomas, 29, would be making his first appearance with a Nuggets (38-15) team that is currently within 2.5 games of first place Golden State in the West, and employing a bevy of talented guards, including Jamal Murray, Gary Harris, Malik Beasley, Will Barton and Monte Morris. Thomas averaged 28.9 points per game for the Boston Celtics in 2016-17, a second-team All-NBA season that appeared to be clearing the way for a long-term, $100 million contract.
Nevertheless, an injury on the same right hip that cut short his playoffs in 2017 and cost him eight months of rehab, and a trade to the Cleveland Cavaliers last summer, upended his hopes for that kind of long-term deal. Thomas joined the Los Angeles Lakers last season as part of a trade-deadline deal with Cleveland, where he played only 15 games in 2017-18.
With the Lakers, Thomas played in 17 games and mostly came off the bench, averaging 15.6 points and 5.0 assists.
He signed a one-year, $2 million deal with the Nuggets in July.

25980554,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Michael Jordan said James Harden's streak of 30 straight 30-point games and Russell Westbrook's 10 straight triple-doubles are both impressive and tough to accomplish.
But the Charlotte Hornets' owner said Tuesday -- flashing a big grin -- that there is one accomplishment tougher than both of those feats: ""Which is harder from the player's standpoint? Six championships, by all means.""
Russell Westbrook made history Monday night with his 10th consecutive triple-double, passing Wilt Chamberlain's mark of nine straight set in 1968.
James Harden, limited to 11 points at halftime, got on a roll in the second half despite a bothersome shoulder to pull within one 30-point game of tying Wilt Chamberlain for the second-longest 30-point streak in NBA history.
Jordan, who won six titles with the Chicago Bulls in the 1990s, praised both players for what they're doing, noting that both streaks are hard to accomplish.
Jordan said the milestones show ""the talent that we have within the league.""
""It shows progression in the league,"" Jordan said during an interview at the Hornets' facility while discussing the upcoming All-Star Weekend. ""I am very proud of how both guys have done because they are making a mark for the league, and I think it really helps grow the league.""
Harden needed a late scoring spree on Monday night to extend his streak to 30 games, scoring 11 points in the final 100 seconds as the Rockets defeated the Dallas Mavericks 120-104. Harden, who is playing with a strained left shoulder, reached the 30-point mark by swishing a 30-foot pull-up jumper with 52.9 seconds remaining.
Westbrook finished with 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists to notch his 10th straight triple-double in the Thunder's 120-111 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, breaking a tie with Wilt Chamberlain for the most consecutive triple-doubles.
Both players will be in Charlotte this weekend for the All-Star Game.

25979484,"Sixty-three boys and girls, ranging in age from 16 to 18 and from 31 countries, will get measured, undergo athletic testing, practice, scrimmage and conduct drills under the watchful eyes of representatives of all 30 NBA teams. Participants will also attend daily seminars for life skills and attend the Rising Stars, dunk contest, 3-point shootout and the All-Star Game.
Despite being relatively new, this camp, which aims to pull together some of the most talented non-American prospects in the world, has quickly ascended to the top of NBA executives' calendars as a must-scout event. It's become somewhat of a ""rite of passage"" for internationals vying to join the NBA, something that is reflected in the number of players drafted since its inception in 2015.
Seven former participants from the initial camps in 2015 and 2016 have gone on to be lottery picks, including Deandre Ayton, Jamal Murray, Lauri Markkanen and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The likes of R.J. Barrett, Rui Hachimura and Sekou Doumbouya are projected to join them as 2019 NBA draft lottery picks from the 2017 and 2018 BWB Global camps.
This year's camp will be headlined by Deni Avdija (Israel), Amar Sylla (Senegal), Killian Hayes (France), Khalifa Diop (Senegal), Matej Rudan (Croatia) and others.
Avdija and Sylla are both projected lottery picks in the 2020 draft, with strong resumes at the FIBA national team level and with their respective club teams on the European circuit.
The 6-foot-9, 18-year-old Avdija is already seeing minutes playing professionally with Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel and the Euroleague. He led their junior team to the finals of the ANGT Munich a few weeks ago with impressive averages of 24 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and four steals. He also helped the Israeli national team win the U20 European Championship last summer, being named to the all-tournament squad despite playing up three years on the competition as a then-17-year-old. While the size of a power forward, he often plays point guard, showing deep shooting range, excellent ball-handling ability and high-level court vision and basketball IQ.
Seventeen-year-old Sylla, a Real Madrid product, helped defeat Avdija's team to win the ANGT Munich, posting 15 points, eight rebounds and three blocks in just 20 minutes per game. He established himself as a top-shelf long-term prospect at the inaugural NBA Global Camp in Treviso last June, showing elite potential defensively at 6-foot-9 with a 7-foot-2 wingspan, guarding all over the floor thanks to his impressive mobility, intensity and instincts. His skill level is still a work in progress, but he shows intriguing flashes of potential as a shooter and finisher.
Seventeen-year-old Killian Hayes will be returning to the BWB after an up-and-down showing at last year's camp in Los Angeles. The 6-foot-5, impressively built, Florida-born combo guard has been seeing quite a bit of playing time in the French first division with Cholet, averaging seven points and three assists in 19 minutes of action. He was named to the FIBA U17 World Championship all-tournament team in July after leading his French national team to the championship game, where they were defeated by the United States. Currently projected as the No. 15 prospect in the ESPN 2020 mock draft, Hayes still has something to prove to NBA scouts, as he's struggled at times to create his own shot against better athletes and has been a streaky shooter for much of his career.
A number of U.S.-based international players who are on the NCAA track will also be participating at the camp, including five star Canadian Addison Patterson, Puerto Rican Julian Strawther, Dutch forward Tristan Enaruna, Nigerian big man Cliff Omoruyi and Gonzaga-bound Russian Pavel Zakharov.
The camp also will give NBA scouts a chance to evaluate 10 players from the various NBA Academies scattered around the globe. Three of the participants are currently at the NBA Global Academy in Canberra, Australia; four are at the NBA Academy Latin America in Mexico City; two are at the NBA Academy Africa in Senegal; and one is at the NBA Academy in India. The headliner of this group is Malian big man Oumar Ballo, who averaged 21 points and 17 rebounds at the FIBA U17 World Championship this past summer, despite playing up as a 15-year-old. Ballo has missed much of the season with an ankle injury and may not be at 100 percent for this event.
Quite a few players on the list have never been seen by the majority of the NBA, though, meaning there are bound to be some surprises who emerge over the course of the weekend.
A host of NBA players and coaches will help run the camp and share their vast experience in professional basketball, including 2019 NBA All-Stars Nikola Jokic and Nikola Vucevic. Rising stars participants Deandre Ayton and Bogdan Bogdanovic will also meet with the prospects and help with on-court instruction alongside coaching staff members including Festus Ezeli, Adonal Foyle, Jennifer Azzi, Allison Feaster, Ashley Battle, Taj McWilliams, Astou N'Diaye, Andrea Stinson, Dutch Gaitley, Nate Mitchell, Ronald Nored, John Bryant, Michael Ray Richardson and Mark Madsen.
Portions of the camp will be livestreamed on the NBA's Facebook page at Facebook.com/NBA and FIBA's Facebook page at Facebook.com/FIBA.

25934196,"INDIANAPOLIS -- As the Indiana Pacers' lead ballooned into the 40s in the fourth quarter Tuesday, so too did the distance between LeBron James and his next closest teammate on the bench.
The Los Angeles Lakers' eventual 136-94 drubbing at the hands of the Pacers ended up being the worst loss of James' 16-year NBA career. And the optics of seeing the four-time MVP parked in the final spot on the sideline with three empty seats between him and Brandon Ingram might have been even worse, illustrating how far away this team seems from the contenders James is accustomed to being a part of.
Tuesday's contest in Indianapolis represented the worst loss in a game LeBron James has played in during his 16-year NBA career.
The Lakers already beat Indiana this season -- a 104-96 decision on Nov. 29 in Los Angeles -- when the Pacers were missing Victor Oladipo. But with Oladipo now out for the season -- and Indiana going 2-4 since the All-Star guard's injury and playing on the second night of a back-to-back -- the Pacers got their revenge and then some.
The Lakers are now 7-13 in their past 20 games -- playing 18 of those without James as he dealt with a left groin strain -- free-falling from fourth place to 10th in the Western Conference standings since Christmas Day.
And with just two days left before Thursday's NBA trade deadline, the team's cohesion stands at an even more tenuous position than its 27-27 record.
Following a loss at the Golden State Warriors over the weekend -- a game in which L.A. held a double-digit second-half lead before getting blown out -- Lakers coach Luke Walton and veterans JaVale McGee and Michael Beasley got into a verbal sparring match in the locker room, according to sources.
But that turned out to be better than Tuesday's performance, in which the Lakers didn't show any fight, trailing by as many as 46 points and never holding a lead.
Meanwhile, the Lakers' brass has been entrenched in serious trade talks with the New Orleans Pelicans surrounding their star center, Anthony Davis; and just about every player on the Lakers' roster has heard his name attached to a potential deal for Davis.
""The only players whose play hasn't been affected by the trade talks are James and Rajon Rondo,"" a team source told ESPN on Tuesday.
Walton tried to steer his team's focus away from the speculation before the Pacers game, saying, ""This is a big game for us. Our guys are locked in. They know that this is the only thing that matters right now is the game we're getting ready to play.""
But the crowd at Bankers Life Fieldhouse offered a loud reminder of what's at stake this week, chanting ""LeBron's gonna trade you!"" at various times when Ingram, McGee and Kyle Kuzma were shooting free throws.
""I heard it,"" Ingram said. ""I still made the free throws. I've been through and I've heard worse, way worse things in my life. But it is what it is.""
Even if the Lakers players blocked out the fans, James wondered aloud if they also are blocking out what gets to them through their phones.
""I know it has to be tough on a lot of our guys, especially our young guys,"" James said. ""Right now, they've just never been a part of it and they're hearing it every single day -- and I know that the worst thing that you can do right now is be on social media. And I know all young guys love social media. So, that definitely can't help.""
On a night when James became the fifth player in league history to hit 32,000 career points on a dunk over Indiana's Myles Turner -- his 18 points bringing him less than 300 points away from Michael Jordan for No. 4 on the all-time scoring list -- he also dealt with the lopsided defeat.
Before Tuesday, James' worst defeats were two games in which his club lost by 35 points: Jan. 16, 2017, when the Cleveland Cavaliers fell 126-91 to the Warriors in Oakland, California; and Nov. 28, 2007, when the Cavaliers lost 109-74 at the Detroit Pistons.
There are 28 games left in the regular season for the Lakers, and they're currently 2.5 games behind the LA Clippers for the eighth and final playoff spot.
The Lakers have agreed in principle to trade guard Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and a second-round draft pick to the Pistons for guard Reggie Bullock, a source told The Undefeated's Marc Spears.
Things already had started to shake up ahead of Thursday's deadline, with L.A. agreeing in principle to send Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and a future second-round pick to the Pistons for Reggie Bullock, as confirmed to The Undefeated's Marc Spears. And an earthquake-type shift could still occur if the Lakers land Davis.
ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Tuesday that L.A. was waiting on a counteroffer from the Pelicans after adding Josh Hart and Ivica Zubac to a trade package that already included Ingram, Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and two first-round picks.
Maybe the deal gets done in the next day and a half. But if it doesn't, can the Lakers pick up the pieces still left in L.A. and start to play like a cohesive unit once again?
""I don't know if it's that simple,"" Rondo said. ""It's not like the trade deadline happens and then everything is going to be back to normal. Guys are hearing it. It's a different mentality to have, obviously. Some of the young guys have never been through this situation.
""I can't speak up for them, but I know when I was that age, you may say it doesn't affect you, but it can mess with you a little bit mentally. It doesn't mean you're going to play bad, in the same sense, but it's part of the game.""

25960655,"If the past two games are any indication, this new version of the Philadelphia 76ers might spell trouble for the rest of the Eastern Conference. Coach Brett Brown has wasted no time implementing new forward Tobias Harris and showing the NBA the potential of his loaded starting lineup, dubbed the Phantastic 5 by NBA poet laureate Tim Bontemps.
In crunch time against the Denver Nuggets on Friday, the Phantastic 5 were marvelous. The lineup took over in a tied game with 4:09 remaining. Harris immediately drained a 12-foot floater, initiating a 14-7 game-ending run that turned a nail-biter into a breezy victory. Through two games and 30 minutes together, this unit is blitzing opponents with a plus-22.9 net rating.
Elton Brand and the Sixers' front office couldn't have asked for a better debut. Harris seemed to enjoy it too:
All of us rn. #HereTheyCome pic.twitter.com/QXrIxx58V7
- Philadelphia 76ers (@sixers) February 9, 2019
It's crazy to think that a journeyman who has bounced around five teams in his first seven years could make such a difference. But Harris has emerged as a bona fide star in this league. Check this out: There are only nine dudes in the NBA averaging more than 20 points per game with a true shooting percentage over 60: James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Karl-Anthony Towns, Kevin Durant, Buddy Hield and Harris. Those fellas aren't journeymen.
The guy has been one of the best volume scorers in the league. A quick look at Harris' shot chart should make Sixers fans swoon.
But impressive shot charts and elite shooting stats are only one part of the story. A deeper dive into the fit between Harris and the Sixers reveals a few challenges.
Great young NBA players rarely switch teams multiple times. So why has Harris logged so many area codes? Well, he hasn't been great for long. He has struggled to develop and find his place in the NBA. Harris never thrived in his first three stops, but that changed with the LA Clippers. Doc Rivers and the coaching staff turned Harris loose as a pick-and-roll ball handler. Harris loves to drive left, Doc loves ball screens and the Clippers designed sets that featured Harris attacking defenses from his favorite spots.
Tobias Harris scores 33 points on 11-of-19 shooting as the Clippers edge the Suns in overtime.
It was unprecedented. Harris was never featured in pick-and-rolls until this season. Coming into this campaign, Harris never averaged more than 7.8 picks per game, according to Second Spectrum data. But that figure suddenly surged to 17.1 this season, and so did Harris' star status around the league.
All those pick plays fueled the breakout season that turned Harris into a huge trade piece in one of this season's blockbuster deals. But here's the thing: As he moves from L.A. to Philly, Harris is leaving an environment where pick-and-rolls flow like rivers to one where they barely exist: Per Second Spectrum, the Clippers run the most picks in the league; the Sixers run the least. Take this for data:
Harris arrived in Philadelphia as the fourth-most active ballhandling forward in pick plays this season, but unless Philly suddenly changes its stripes -- and unless Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons suddenly disappear -- Harris' on-ball usage will crater. He'll derive most of his value in off-ball situations.
But fear not, Philly fans, Harris' off-ball powers will likely shine brighter than ever. He can quickly become one of the most dangerous stretch-4s in the NBA, and his impressive catch-and-shoot abilities from long range are going to be vital on a team desperate for shooting. Aside from JJ Redick, the Sixers' stars all have one thing in common: They don't thrive from 3. Butler, Simmons and Joel Embiid combine for just 2.4 3s per game and shoot 33 percent from downtown as a trio.
Together, Redick and Harris can deodorize some of that perimeter stank -- and bring spacing, to boot.
After Butler arrived in November, the Sixers MacGyvered acceptable 3-point offense with role players. Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet and Wilson Chandler represented three of Philly's top four 3-point shooters following the Butler trade. But those fellas were just sent packing in this Harris deal, meaning that Philly needs to reinvent its perimeter arsenal. Harris will be the centerpiece of that effort.Editor's PicksProjecting the impactful NBA buyout marketThe second transaction season is officially here.Do you even watch basketball?

The second transaction season is officially here.
Here we go: Ten multiple-choice questions on the All-Stars and snubs. Shoot your shot.
Harris is making an impressive 41.7 percent of his catch-and-shoot tries this season. The Sixers have to exploit that. Brown should pay special attention to the new guy's corner numbers. You know why? Because among the 86 players who have tried at least 50 corner 3s this season, Harris ranks second in efficiency. He has knocked down an incredible 52.9 percent of his corner looks, second only to Stephen Curry.
That's one reason this Harris acquisition represents a matchup nightmare. Opponents not only have to keep defenders close to Harris on the perimeter, they have to keep a skilled defender close to him. Harris is essentially replacing Chandler as Philly's starting 4. Chandler can shoot, but he is a statue compared with Harris. Teams used Chandler as a safe space to hide their weaker defenders. That's where the Boston Celtics stashed Kyrie Irving. But Irving can't handle Harris. That's a job for Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum. At 6-foot-9 and 235 pounds, Harris is too big, too skilled and too dynamic.
The arrival of Harris eliminates all the hiding places for weak defenders. The Celtics have one of the best defenses in the league, but with Harris on board, the Sixers can now hunt mismatches and target weak spots -- like, say, Irving or Gordon Hayward -- more easily than they could with Chandler in the starting group.
Within the Phantastic 5, Redick is probably the easiest guy to defend -- and he's terrifying, constantly running around, bouncing off screens and turning minor defensive lapses into frightening jump-shooting opportunities.
Nobody should be happier about the Harris acquisition than Embiid, whose new frontcourt mate -- and the threat of his jumper -- will thin out defenses and open up the paint for Philly's centerpiece.
Embiid not only remains the most valuable player on this team, he is beginning to look like the most valuable big man on the planet. Sorry, Brow, but Embiid is the best two-way big in the league, and the numbers prove it.
Even after the massive trades, Embiid is far and away the Sixers' most dominant scorer. Only one Sixer is averaging more than 21 points per game, and it's Embiid. His 27 PPG is unheard of for a center in the time of pace, space and small ball. The last center to hit that number was Shaquille O'Neal ... more than 15 years ago!
At just 24, Embiid is averaging career highs in points, rebounds, assists and free throws. He ranks second in the league in free throw attempts behind human foul magnet James Harden. The spacing and dynamic playmaking Harris brings to the table will only make Embiid a bigger problem.
Pairing Harris with Embiid immediately creates one of the best frontcourts in the whole league. Both dudes threaten opponents on and off the ball. Harris can act as a quintessential stretch-4 or take turns quarterbacking sets, while Embiid's youthful interior dominance manifests as a post threat and as a putback machine. Embiid already leads the league in tip-ins, and if Harris starts drawing opposing bigs farther from the rim, Embiid's putback game will get even more dangerous.
On defense, it is hard to overstate just how good Embiid has been. He is the best defensive rebounder in the league, and his rim protection numbers make him a Defensive Player of the Year candidate. Per Second Spectrum data, Embiid is defending more than 17 shots per game this season (second most in the NBA), and opponents are averaging less than a point per shot against him -- a better mark than that of Rudy Gobert.
Embiid's monstrous impact turns the Sixers into an elite defense. When Embiid is on the court, the Sixers' defensive rating is 102.1, which would be the NBA's best overall mark this season. When he is off the court, the defense leaks 108.9 points per 100 possessions.
On/off stats leave little doubt about who is Philly's most important player. Since the Butler trade in November, Embiid has the highest on-court net rating on the entire team, and he is the only Sixer with a negative off-court mark. When Embiid is on the court, Philly crushes on both ends. When he is on the bench, the Sixers lose.
If Brown can get this all to click in the next few months, the Sixers could enter the playoffs with a scary team. If it all meshes, the Harris acquisition could propel this team to the top of the East. If it doesn't, Philly will have some tough choices to make this summer. Will the Sixers drop maxes on Butler and Harris?
There's risk no matter what, but the next few months will provide a key glimpse into the long-term future of the Phantastic 5.

25968647,"PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia 76ers made almost 58 percent of their shots in Sunday's 143-120 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, but the most discussed shot after the game was one that didn't go in.
That was the 3-pointer Ben Simmons took less than a minute into the third quarter of Sunday's blowout win for the Sixers, their second in a row with their new-look starting five. But given the potential ramifications for this team if it becomes a regular occurrence, the shot could have been the most important one the Sixers took all game.
""I might as well come down and pull it,"" Simmons said of the attempt, which came in the middle of the shot clock. ""I didn't really think about it.""
The rest of the Eastern Conference might be in trouble.
Everyone else, though, couldn't stop thinking -- or talking -- about it.
""I loved it,"" Tobias Harris said. ""And it was in the basket, too.""
""A little bit like everybody's,"" Sixers coach Brett Brown said when asked what the bench's reaction was when Simmons took the shot. ""Like, 'OK.'""
When asked for his thoughts on the shot, Joel Embiid -- as usual -- was far more descriptive. After JJ Redick said he ""wasn't shocked"" by Simmons' shot, Embiid turned to him and said, ""You sure?"" Then, after the laughter died down, Embiid described the play from his vantage point.
""It actually was going in,"" he said. ""Me, personally, I was getting ready to run the play, and then I just literally, I just saw the ball go over, and I was like, 'Oh, s---.' It caught me off-guard, and then I was in the position where [I was thinking], 'What just happened?'""
He wasn't alone in being surprised. For all of the success Simmons has created for himself the past season and a half -- including winning Rookie of the Year last season and being voted into the All-Star Game as a reserve last month -- his lack of a jump shot often becomes the biggest talking point about his game. That comes from both how many things Simmons does well -- as a 6-foot-10 point guard who weighs 230 pounds, he has drawn comparisons to one man he was playing against (LeBron James) and one who was watching from the crowd (Magic Johnson) for a reason -- and how useful his jumper is compared to the rest of his game.
For example: Markelle Fultz, despite all the issues he has had with his jumper, has gone 4-for-14 from 3-point range in 19 games this season. Even after Sunday's attempt, Simmons has taken three of them in 55 games. All but Sunday's came at the end of a quarter or shot clock, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.
That lack of shooting from Simmons is what, according to Brown, prompted a discussion between the coach and his star point guard in the 24 hours leading up to Sunday's game. Brown, who likes to break Philadelphia's season into thirds, said he and Simmons discussed how they could use the final third of the season -- which began Sunday for the now 36-20 Sixers -- to prepare Simmons for the playoffs.
Simmons struggled against the Boston Celtics in Philadelphia's five-game loss in the Eastern Conference semifinals a year ago, and Sunday afternoon saw James practically dare Simmons into shooting by spending most of his time guarding him standing underneath the basket.
""We've talked about this a lot, and I thought it looked good,"" Brown said. ""The shot looked good. The rhythm of it looked good. It was close to going in. He didn't look uncomfortable shooting it. And he can tell you the story if he chooses, but he and I spoke about this notion for a little bit in the last 24 hours. What's going to happen in the third third of the regular season? What can we do to prepare you for the playoffs, and what's coming?
Joel Embiid describes his reaction to Ben Simmons' 3-point shot attempt and what his thoughts are.
""We all saw to an extreme LeBron not guard him, and we all have memories of the Celtics series, so somewhere in the middle, we have a window of 27 or whatever amount of games left, and I'd like to try some of this stuff in the final games here before the All-Star break and take off with it for the final third. It's a long explanation to your question, but the underbelly of the reason is significant.""
For Simmons, that conversation boiled down to one thing: growing more willing to take the shots that opposing defenses, like James and the Lakers, are going to give him.
""I think just being more aggressive, taking more open shots and just trying to grow my game in that way,"" he said. ""I think I'm getting there. It just takes time, but I'm going to get there.""
With Philadelphia's new-look starting five, the Sixers can attack that extra space in ways other than having Simmons shoot. One of them is using him in dribble handoffs with a sharpshooter such as Redick when a player such as James gives Simmons so much space. In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia ran a play out of a timeout that got Redick an open 3 that took advantage of how far James was from Simmons on a typical offensive set.
Even with the amount of firepower Philadelphia has at its disposal after acquiring Harris in a blockbuster trade with the Clippers last week, Simmons' complete lack of a perimeter shot is viewed as a potential Achilles' heel for this team's chances of making it out of the murderous final couple of rounds of the East playoffs and reaching the NBA Finals for the first time since 2001.
It should come as no surprise then that, to a man, everyone on the Sixers was publicly encouraging Simmons to keep shooting 3s -- regardless of whether they go in.
""I thought it was in,"" Embiid said. ""It was in and out. I wish he would've made it. But he's been working on that. Every day we tell him he's got to shoot it. There's nothing wrong with that.
""I'm a 30 percent 3-point shooter, and you've got guys that jump on my fake. I don't understand how that's possible, but they still do. So every day he works on it, and I think it's coming. That was the first step, and I hope that he keeps shooting.""
For his part, Simmons said he would -- but also that, even if he begins taking more 3s, he isn't going to allow it to take away from the other parts of his game that have made him into an elite player without having a credible threat of a jump shot.
""I will start pulling up,"" he said, ""but it's not one thing I am looking at. It's not everything. I'm not focused on just doing that. I am going to play my game, play to my strengths and continue to try to get better.""

25967153,"Kyrie Irving has been diagnosed with a strained right knee after an MRI in Boston, the team announced Sunday. The Celtics guard is listed as day-to-day.
Irving suffered the injury with about five minutes left in the second quarter of Saturday night's game against the Clippers. The Clippers outscored the Celtics 75-44 after Irving left, coming back from 28 points down to win 123-112.
Kyrie Irving hurt his right knee with about five minutes left in the second quarter while attempting to defend Garrett Temple. The Clippers outscored the Celtics 75-44 after Irving left to win 123-112 at Boston on Saturday.
Irving missed the end of last season and the playoffs after having surgery on his left knee to remove two screws from his patella that were inserted in 2015 to repair a fracture he suffered during that year's NBA Finals.
A bacterial infection was discovered at the site of the screws when Irving had surgery in March 2018 to remove tension wire in the knee. He had the screws removed in April.

25944936,"Let's revive an old Grantland tradition and ask who's on notice after the whirlwind of the last 48 hours.
Assuming Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Boston and Toronto all advance, I'm not sure there will have ever been a playoff round with more potential to swing superstar free agency than the conference semifinals in the East. Two of these four must lose. Lose badly, and eyes will wander.
• Even the placid Bucks have four starters entering free agency. Keeping all of them might vault Milwaukee into the luxury tax. Are the Bucks willing to do that if they lose in the second round? How would Giannis Antetokounmpo -- up for a supermax after next season -- react if Milwaukee were to let the wrong person walk?
Amid trade mania, the Bucks have quietly coalesced into a juggernaut. They know who they are. They have found the sweet spot where guys play with freedom and confidence but don't break from the team construct. They can shapeshift into any lineup type. They are No. 4 in offense and No. 1 in defense, with the scoring margin of a champion. Coaches and players say privately that they feel something special brewing -- something some of them have never felt.
Adding Nikola Mirotic makes them even more malleable. (Outbidding the Sixers, who offered two second-round picks, per sources, probably made it sweeter. The Sixers and Pelicans also discussed the general framework of a Mirotic-Markelle Fultz swap before Philadelphia acquired Tobias Harris, sources say. It is unclear how far those talks would have advanced otherwise.) He unlocks more Giannis-at-center lineups, and can even jostle with some centers himself to spare Antetokounmpo wear and tear.
• The other three teams have four combined max-level free agents in Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Kyrie Irving, and Kawhi Leonard. The last two -- along with Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant -- will determine the league's balance of power.
The vibes out of Toronto over the past six weeks have been just a little off. The relationship between Kyle Lowry and Masai Ujiri is clearly not hunky-dory. It never has been. Lowry misses DeMar DeRozan. I'm not sure any of that bleeds onto the floor. Lowry will play his game when it matters. But back injuries and Leonard's load management have short-circuited Toronto's chances to build chemistry. Marc Gasol is an undeniable upgrade, but he further unsettles their rotation.Editor's PicksNBA trade deadline: Deals, grades and intelAnthony Davis is still a Pelican, but big names like Marc Gasol and Markelle Fultz are on the move.

Anthony Davis is still a Pelican, but big names like Marc Gasol and Markelle Fultz are on the move. Get the latest news and analysis, including trade grades and after-the-buzzer updates.
Which players and picks are on the move? We have a rundown of the latest deals.
(Charlotte came close to acquiring Gasol before some last-minute haggling, per league sources. The Hornets had a lottery-protected first-round pick ready for most of this week, sources say. Losing Gasol hurts, but they get to keep that pick, and the East is so bad they might limp into the playoffs anyway. Just pray for Kemba Walker, who has zero help.)
Gasol brings a high-IQ game that can calm Toronto's offense in crunch time of playoff games. Toronto got him without sacrificing a first-round pick, or any essential part of their future. (Delon Wright could do well in Memphis, but he was a luxury for Toronto. The return beyond that is uninspiring for Memphis considering Gasol is a franchise icon. The Grizzlies in the end may have moved a year late.) He is one of the league's very best one-on-one post defenders -- an ideal antidote to Joel Embiid. He can drag Embiid away from the rim on the other end.
But does Gasol supplant Serge Ibaka as Toronto's full-time starting center? The Raptors have thrived with Ibaka there. He can play some alongside Gasol, but it might be too late to shift him back to power forward in the starting lineup. Doing that would slide Pascal Siakam to the wing, and Danny Green to the bench. Siakam can play any nominal position, but the Siakam-Ibaka-Gasol trio is a little antiquated. Toronto has gotten where it is by being rangy and fast, heavy with switchy wings. Some rivals are hoping they trade speed for size.
The right answer might be starting Gasol and Siakam, and I would guess that is where they land. Can they sell that to Ibaka?
Maybe the Raptors can toggle between Gasol and Ibaka depending on matchups, as they did with Ibaka and Jonas Valanciunas. Can they sell that to Gasol? Regardless, Toronto is all-in.
• Philly is too, having traded out of its war chest for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris. (They still have a bundle of extra second-rounders coming to them.) The Clippers did well to snare two first-rounders for Harris on an expiring contract. Teams could not acquire first-round picks, even for good players, without swallowing bad money.
New Orleans wanted a first-rounder for Mirotic; it got four second-rounders instead -- strong return, still. Washington had one Otto Porter Jr. deal on the table that would have brought back a low first-rounder, but only if it took on money extending beyond this season, sources say. The Nets and Grizzlies briefly discussed a swap of Allen Crabbe -- earning $19 million next season -- and Denver's first-rounder for the Garrett Temple/JaMychal Green pairing, sources say. Memphis, facing tax concerns, instead flipped those two for Avery Bradley's semi-expiring deal -- and no picks.
Given that it took zero first-round picks to get Mirotic, Gasol, Porter and Harrison Barnes, the Sixers probably overpaid for Harris. The price telegraphs that they view Harris as more than a rental. He is better than those other guys. Philly's new starting five is loaded. How wonderful to have Harris as your fourth-best player.
Big Fours are rare. The financial cost is enormous -- more than most teams can bear. Typical fourth starters don't handle the ball as much as Harris likes. He's a great shooter, and there are no diminishing returns on shooters. But there will be diminishing returns here, no matter how rigidly Philly staggers their five starters.
Golden State's Big Four works because one almost doesn't have to dribble (Klay Thompson), and a second is content averaging six points per game if he gets to pass a lot (Draymond Green). The fit in Philly will be trickier, and there is a lot riding on them figuring it out in short order. No matter what they say today, it is not a lock that they max out both Butler and Harris this summer. (Both are good bets, and maybe certainties, to get max contracts somewhere. There are just too many slots out there now.)
The playoffs will be pivotal.
• Boston did nothing, but it won the deadline by virtue of the Lakers and Pelicans doing nothing with Anthony Davis. The Celtics are 25-9 since their 10-10 start. Now all they have to do is perform well enough in the postseason to coax Irving into staying. That became an even taller order Thursday.
It's possible Boston has the lowest game-to-game ceiling of all four teams, though it's hard to tell until we've seen them all play a fair bit. But the Celtics feel like the team among this group with the lowest margin of error -- the one that needs to play every second at peak urgency.
Durant's bizarre, finger-wagging news conference laid bare that he is struggling with the frenzy surrounding his impending free agency. Durant joined a 73-win team and proceeded to sign two short-term contracts. His business partner tweeted, not entirely facetiously, that he would like to run the Knicks someday. This frenzy is what happens.
If Durant frets, it will seep into the locker room in some way. It has to. It already did, when Draymond Green unleashed an in-game tirade that fractured Golden State's chemistry.
This team should be too talented to lose four times in seven games to anyone. The Warriors are 32-6 in the postseason since acquiring Durant.
But all it takes is one two-game blip for a series to become A Moment. It happened last season against the Rockets, and Durant, existing almost outside of Golden State's offense and missing a lot, was at the center of some weird malaise. (Houston had a lot to do with that. Had the Rockets won that series, they would have earned it.) The league is waiting to see what happens if anyone manages to punch the Warriors in the mouth early in a series -- if adversity exposes lingering tension. How will they react if they are down 2-1, facing Game 4 on the road?
I mean, they'll probably win. They have two of the league's three best players and three other All-Star types. But that is the league's hope -- that they might break apart at the wrong moment.
The outcome will determine the degree to which Boston and the Lakers have competition for Davis. If the Knicks win, New York has a decision to make. If the Clippers miss the playoffs, they will have a 2 or 3 percent chance to vault into the top five. If the Kings miss the playoffs and somehow land the No. 1 pick -- chances of that range from 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent -- that selection slides from Boston to Philadelphia, creating another potential out-of-nowhere Davis suitor.
The Pelicans will be watching Kevin Knox, Frank Ntilikina, and Dennis Smith Jr. Knox looks the part. He's shooting a hair below league average from deep, but on a diet of attempts -- curling off screens, semi-contested -- that suggests a good shooter who can survive in highly competitive contexts. He can attack a bit off the bounce, and has a nice floater. Knox has a long way to go defensively, but that was expected.
Smith has passed Ntilikina as a prospect. The league got too far down on Smith too fast. He has issues -- dancing with the ball, so-so decision-making, lax defense -- but those are typical of young point guards. Smith is a legit athlete who can do some rare things.
Ntilkina's defense, solid across multiple positions, will get him only so far if he remains one of the worst offensive players in the league.
If the Knicks don't get the No. 1 pick and have dreams of Davis, they need the Pelicans to love one of these guys.
The Bulls will crow that they have a frontline of the future in Porter, Lauri Markkanen, and Wendell Carter Jr. The Markkanen-Carter duo is going to be good -- perfect for the modern NBA. Porter is solid. Some front offices think he's much better than that, though they worry about his hip; it depressed Porter's trade value.
He's also four and six years older than Markkanen and Carter, respectively. I didn't mind Chicago cutting into its cap space to sign a winning player. No one big was going there. Cap room has loosened around the league; absorbing someone else's bad money won't be as profitable.
But Porter is a complementary player paid like a star. He completes a good team. He does not make a bad team good even if his salary suggests he should be able to.
The Bulls need someone to wrest control of their team. Porter can't do that. Chicago's biggest on-court problem is that their guards have shown no indication they will grow into the sort of players who might.
Dunn shows flashes, but he can't shoot; no one guards him when LaVine has the ball. He's an average playmaker. LaVine averages four assists per game despite having the ball all the time. In Year 5, he is still lazing into off-the-dribble long 2s like this:
It is lost on no one within the Bulls that they are 4-2 under Jim Boylen when LaVine has been out and 3-21 otherwise. That stat could mean nothing, but it has been noted.
Dunn was there to be had at the deadline, sources say. LaVine was not, but the Bulls probably would have listened had someone overwhelmed them -- which no one was going to do.
Over six weeks, the Wizards made a win-now move -- Kelly Oubre Jr. for Trevor Ariza -- and then pivoted into semi-tankery to duck the tax. They effectively salary-dumped a 25-year-old wing -- Porter -- who literally days earlier was supposedly borderline untouchable. Only 19 months ago, they matched a max contract offer for Porter -- and weren't all that mad! Now they've traded him for two guys on expiring deals. (By the way: In that same summer, Washington let Bojan Bogdanovic go to retain Porter. Bogdanovic then signed a two-year, $21 million deal with Indiana that looks like a joke. You think the Wizards would like to have that one back?)
Bobby Portis will help Washington now. Jabari Parker probably won't. Portis will be a free agent this summer; the Bulls don't need to meet his desired price with Markkanen and Carter in front of him.
You can't pin Washington's lack of coherence just on John Wall's sad injuries. Every move is intertwined.
Getting out of tax prison is fine in a vacuum. There was not a great Porter trade out there to make, and they can't do much of anything with Wall set to take up 35-ish percent of the cap going forward. They can build a decent team (by East standards) if they re-sign Tomas Satoransky. Hooray.
It's everything up to this point that hurts. Finding a way to navigate the next three or four years without tanking is going to be really hard.
So what do you do now? Roll over and die like you did in Indiana on Tuesday, when the Lakers looked like the zombie pre-trade-deadline Cavaliers from last season? The Clippers could still make the playoffs, but I'm not sure they want to. The Kings are puppies, even if they are rising. The Lakers with LeBron and trade chips they view as worthy of netting Anthony Davis can't beat out those two teams for the last playoff spot?
The Lakers are behind, with the toughest remaining schedule of those three. I don't care. LeBron has never made excuses. He played a role, directly or indirectly, in destabilizing his team. Fix it. Thursday's thrilling win in Boston is a good start.
Barnes will have to find a happy medium between the 3-and-D spot-up role he played for the Steve Kerr Warriors and the iso-tastic midrange alpha dog he strived to be in Dallas. More of the former is better, but that player type shouldn't take up 25 percent of a team's salary cap -- and almost never does on a contender. The Kings don't need to worry about that -- yet.
They managed to thread the needle of acquiring a player who helps them win today without compromising much future cap space, or sacrificing a first-round pick. (The Hornets chased Barnes too, but any Charlotte offer including its first-round pick would have come with money the Mavs didn't want, sources say.) The real decision point will come if Barnes declines his $25 million option for next season in hopes of negotiating a long-term deal.2019 NBA trade deadlineWe've got you covered on the biggest deals going down at the NBA trade deadline.• All the trades, grades and intel

Barnes will have to play a ton of small forward given the logjam of bigs on this roster. (The Kings sniffed around some deals that would have sent out Willie Cauley-Stein, but it's unclear how far they got.)
• The Mavs, meanwhile, enter the max contract derby by sloughing Barnes. That has gone poorly for them since Mark Cuban broke up a title team to chase Howard and Deron Williams. It's hard to see the top-tier guys -- Durant, Leonard, Irving -- giving Dallas a real hearing. Much of the next tier might be too old for the Luka Doncic/Kristaps Porzingis timeline. Unfortunately for Dallas, the restricted free agency crop -- the guys on the Doncic/Porzingis age curve -- is pretty thin.
But those two guys are precocious. They contribute to winning now -- provided Porzingis is healthy. Dallas wiggled its way to another bite at the free agency apple. I bet they are aggressive.
• Keep an eye on the Nets. They have caught the eye of agents representing high-profile players. They are getting ambitious -- with good reason.
• The Clippers have done incredible work over the past two years.
If the Pelicans eventually trade Davis for a package heavy on rebuilding assets, keep an eye on Holiday. He wants to be in a place where he can compete in the postseason and is waiting to see the Davis return, sources say.
I'm not sure any team needs a role player to be good as badly as Detroit needs Kennard to be good after jettisoning both Stanley Johnson and Reggie Bullock. I'm optimistic -- at least on offense. Kennard can shoot, and has good feel handling and passing. He makes mistakes on defense, but Dwane Casey can't yank him at the first opportunity anymore. There is no one else to play.
Denver stood pat, understandably happy to ride the good vibes of this season. But the Nuggets are down to 14th in points allowed per possession, and they're 25th since Dec. 1. They are hemorrhaging corner 3s.
They need some core players to get healthy, and to right their defense if they want to do postseason damage.
• The first big trade of the Jeff Weltman/John Hammond era was a low-risk flier on the 2017 No. 1 pick who plays a position of severe need for Orlando -- a no-brainer. Markelle Fultz is long and he can't shoot, which means he was destined to play for the Magic.
They held onto Nikola Vucevic, Aaron Gordon, and Terrence Ross, and insisted in talks over the past few weeks that they would not part with Ross for anything less than a first-round pick, sources say.
(It's possible a straight Fultz-for-Ross swap -- one of my pet fake trades all season -- was never on the table. Perhaps the teams could not agree on draft compensation within the Fultz-Ross construct.)
Those are all fine decisions. Gordon is a good, young player on a declining contract. Vucevic is their best player, and only 28.
They just seem aimless. There are nights when you see what the Gordon-Jonathan Isaac-Vucevic super-big trio can be, but in the aggregate, Gordon still looks miscast as a pseudo-wing. What is this team's identity, beyond being tall? How does it want to play?
• Minnesota did nothing, and had very little to do. There was no real market for Taj Gibson on an expiring deal, or for Jeff Teague, carrying a $19 million option for next season. A couple of teams kicked around trying to swipe Andrew Wiggins on the cheap, but the Wolves expressed little interest in going there, sources say.
Wiggins is back to being unproductive and inefficient after a brief post-Butler bounce. Dario Saric is finding his way. Josh Okogie is going to stick as a rotation guy. But what do these guys really have that moves the needle long term beyond Karl-Anthony Towns and maybe Robert Covington as a nice supporting guy?

25958883,"Thanks in part to the NBA's loosened color rules, the current San Antonio Spurs scorer unveiled the Kobe 4 Protro in vivid teal and purple accents, tying back into the upcoming All-Star Weekend's host city of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Bryant's original draft day colors, after the Hornets selected him 13th overall in the 1996 draft.
""I grew up watching him and idolizing his game, then playing against him and playing in his last All-Star game with him,"" DeRozan said. ""It's a shoe [series] I've worn my whole career. To have that really come full circle is definitely something I can't even put into words.""
While Air Jordans have been rereleased relentlessly over the years as near-replicas of their original designs, Bryant's quest for his relaunches filters through a different approach. ""Protro,"" as he dubbed it, blends both performance and retro, upgrading decade-old technology with more cushioning, lighter materials and sleeker constructions thanks to today's modern manufacturing.
The ""Draft Day"" colorway donned by DeRozan will be fittingly launching during All-Star Weekend beginning Friday in Charlotte. He's expected to have his own player-exclusive colorways of the model as the season continues, and Nike will be releasing even more Kobe 4 Protro editions, diving through draft-inspired storytelling.
With the return of the Kobe 1 Protro over the past year and now the low-top leading fourth edition, the return of the starting points of the long-loved Kobe line feels possibly overdue.

""I was always wondering what it'd take for them to start retroing [Kobes],"" DeRozan said. ""So many dope early-on Kobes haven't been rereleased. I think it was the perfect time for them to be able to come back out, for a new generation to be able to adapt, and for the older crowd that understands, to get them, too.""
While DeRozan and several others around the league have been carrying the torch now that Bryant has left the game, Kelly Oubre Jr. has found himself enjoying one of the more unique sneaker deals around the league. The only active player currently signed to Converse, the Phoenix Suns swingman has been sifting through his own collection of Kobe sneakers on the court, with Converse not producing performance sneakers for now while being a subsidiary of Nike.
The crux of Oubre's impact for the brand has been felt off the court, as he's become arguably just as known for the style and sneakers he brings on a nightly basis to the heightened visibility that is the arena entry. Last week, Oubre debuted Converse's new Black History Month edition of the iconic Chuck Taylor.
""Every game since my rookie year, I kind of came in and just always wanted to look nice and always wanted to outdo myself,"" Oubre said. ""[Style is] not about anybody else, it's about how you feel in what you're wearing. That's kind of been my mantra coming into the league, just wanting to always look my best. Now that it's taken off, I'm just happy to be the freshest person in the NBA.""
As Black History Month continues, players on each team have been proudly wearing current patterned and special themed pairs from several brands, such as Memphis Grizzlies point guard Mike Conley's kente cloth-accented Air Jordan 33. Sacramento Kings speedster De'Aaron Fox has been dipping into a batch of pairs from the very beginning of Nike's annual ""BHM"" launches in 2011, such as the Kobe 6 and KD IV.
Along with a look at his own assortment of ""BHM"" options, PJ Tucker has started to pull out a variety of rare All-Star themed sneakers from years ago, leading into this season's showcase weekend. Unboxing a pair of Nike Kobe 3s made for the 2008 All-Star Game in New Orleans, the red and gum sneaker is highlighted by a white, curling heel swoosh and laces.
""That's the best part!"" Tucker texted. ""The white laces make the shoe.""
Before he takes part in his very first All-Star Weekend in the Rising Stars game, Kings rookie Marvin Bagley III had yet another player-exclusive edition of the Puma Clyde Court to debut, this time inspired by his draft day suit.
While his look last June incorporated a subtle shimmer charcoal-grey jacket and matching bow tie, styled along with a black shirt and pants, it was the inside of the Boushra AlChabaoun-designed jacket that added some flair and personality.
""I just wanted to do something that was a little bit different than everybody else,"" Bagley said at the time. ""Not too flashy, but something that was a little bit different.""
Along the polka-dotted right inner lining of the jacket was his own screaming face, along with a repeat pattern of the acronym ""J.R.E.A.M.,"" a remix of the early 1990's Wu Tang classic song ""C.R.E.A.M.""
""Jesus Rules Everything Around Me,"" Bagley explained. ""That's something that I live by every single day.""
Puma incorporated his face into the shoe's sockliner, and added in the J.R.E.A.M. acronym underneath the clear outsole. As Bagley and the rest of his Puma Hoops rookies take to the Rising Stars game Friday, you can expect to see them debut the brand's newest silhouette for the second half of the season.

25972347,"Stauskas was briefly with the Cavs, who acquired him from the Portland Trail Blazers in a deal for forward Rodney Hood. He never appeared in a game before Cleveland sent him two days later to the Houston Rockets, who promptly traded Stauskas at the deadline to Indiana. The Pacers then waived him, allowing the rebuilding Cavs to scoop him up.
Stauskas, 25, averaged 6.1 points, 1.8 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 44 games as a reserve for the Blazers. He has also played for Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Sacramento, which selected him with the No. 8 overall pick in 2014.
Cleveland, which recently welcomed back All-Star forward Kevin Love following foot surgery, is 11-45 going into Monday's game against the New York Knicks.

25911205,"Malone clinched his first All-Star coaching nod Saturday night, when the Nuggets beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 107-106. The All-Star coaching gigs were determined by which teams have the best records in each conference through Sunday, and Denver (37-15) has clinched a tiebreaker over Golden State (also 37-15) by having a better record against Western Conference opponents.
Denver star Nikola Jokic is also going to the game, as one of the reserves. The All-Star Game is Feb. 17 in Charlotte.
""Obviously any time you can be a part of the All-Star weekend, that's an honor not only for yourself but for your entire coaching staff and for your organization,'' Malone said. ""And that's why we feel tremendous pride that Nikola was voted an All-Star reserve this year. His first time and our first All-Star since Carmelo Anthony. So we take great pride in that.''
His players were especially proud after the game, dousing him with water in the locker room in Minnesota to celebrate.
Coach Malone got quite the celebration from the locker room after tonight's win and him being named a coach of the All-Star game!#MileHighBasketball pic.twitter.com/PIZF6KuNK4
""There was a very small part of me that wanted just to relax with my family and be a husband, be a father for a few days,'' Malone said. ""But any time you can represent, your team, your city, your fans at the All-Star game is an honor. ... Our staff deserves a ton of credit. They work their butts off. Very thankful for everything they do for me every single day.''
Malone will become the third Denver coach to work an All-Star Game: Larry Brown did in 1977, and George Karl did in 2010.
If Denver had lost to Minnesota, Golden State's Steve Kerr would have been the All-Star coach for the third time in five years. He and his staff will get a few days off instead of going to Charlotte for the festivities -- although Warriors stars Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson will be heading there to play in the game.
A beaming, laughing and fist-pumping Kerr said, ""Take care, guys, have fun in Charlotte,'' as he left the postgame interview room after hearing the Denver score.
Curry posted video on Instagram of members of the coaching staff after they had watched the Nuggets close out their win.
""These dudes really don't want to go to Charlotte,"" Curry said. ""They're hating on my city! They're hating on my city!""
Milwaukee's Mike Budenholzer already wrapped up the other spot, with the Bucks atop the Eastern Conference. He'll coach the team that will be selected by the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo.
James and Antetokounmpo will choose their teams Thursday night.
James will pick first in the opening round, where the pool of eight other starters will be divided. Antetokounmpo gets the first pick of the second round, where he and James will choose from the 14 reserves. And James then gets the first pick of the third round, where he'll decide between Dwyane Wade and Dirk Nowitzki -- the two special additions to the game by order of NBA commissioner Adam Silver.

25946881,"The Knicks had talked to teams about potential trades for the past several weeks, sources said, but Kanter's $18.6 million expiring contract proved too difficult to move at Thursday's deadline.
""From the moment he arrived in New York, Enes passionately embraced our franchise and our city,"" Knicks general manager Scott Perry said in a statement. ""He is a courageous individual and we thank him for his many contributions both on the court and in the community. We wish him the absolute best moving forward, personally and professionally.""
Zach Lowe breaks down the teams and players on notice after a whirlwind trade deadline.
After a flurry of trades, which teams are looking worse and which ones got stronger?
Kanter, a vocal critic of Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Turkish government, skipped the Knicks' game in London last month over fears for his safety.
The 26-year-old issued a statement after his release on Twitter, saying he wishes ""nothing but the best"" for the Knicks.
""Each day I spend in the NBA is a blessing and I look forward to my next adventure,"" Kanter posted. ""... As grateful as I am [to the Knicks], I am also excited to continue playing basketball and showcasing that I can be one of the most dominant forces in the paint. New York will always have a special place in my heart and I look forward to returning here and playing in front of these amazing fans again.""
The Boston Celtics are among the teams opposing executives expect to have interest in Kanter.
Matthews, who has an expiring contract, plans to sign with the Indiana Pacers, sources told ESPN. He was traded to New York by the Dallas Mavericks as part of the Kristaps Porzingis deal. He averaged 13.1 points in 44 starts for the Mavericks this season, his 10th in the league.
The Houston Rockets were among the playoff teams who had interest in signing Matthews after his buyout, sources said.

• Davis is still a Pelican -- now what? 
• What's next for Markelle Fultz in Orlando?
• How good are the Raptors with Gasol?
• Trade machine: You be the GM
The Athletic first reported the planned agreement between Matthews and Indiana.
Kanter, 26, had appeared in just three of the Knicks' past 12 games and had been vocal about his displeasure over his reduced role.
Coach David Fizdale has prioritized playing and developing younger players in recent weeks. Newly acquired DeAndre Jordan has started ahead of Kanter, and Fizdale said he wanted Jordan to help younger players Luke Kornet and Mitchell Robinson learn how to defend.
Kanter has averaged 14 points and 10.5 rebounds -- tied for 12th in the league -- in just 25.6 minutes per game this season, but he ranked last out of 68 qualified centers in ESPN's defensive real plus-minus metric. He is tied for third in the NBA in offensive rebounding (3.9 per game) since the start of the 2017-18 season.
The Knicks (10-43) acquired Kanter in a 2017 trade that sent Carmelo Anthony to the Oklahoma City Thunder.
New York didn't execute any trades before Thursday's deadline. The Orlando Magic expressed interest in Frank Ntilikina but were told that New York was not trading the second-year guard, sources told ESPN. The club also received interest in recent days for big man Noah Vonleh, sources said. Vonleh, a free agent this summer, is having a strong season (8.6 points, 8.5 rebounds per game) in New York.
The Knicks also decided to keep Jordan, despite suggestions that the veteran would be bought out. The club now has three open roster spots. New York also has roughly $70 million in cap space this summer -- enough for two max contracts.
Opposing teams expect the Knicks to be aggressive in pursuing the top free agents in the coming offseason, a group that includes Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving.
Some close to Durant see New York as a possible landing spot for the back-to-back NBA Finals MVP if he chooses to leave the Golden State Warriors, according to league sources.

25941838,"DALLAS -- Harrison Barnes watched the fourth quarter of the Mavericks' 99-93 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday from the bench after learning that he was being traded to the Sacramento Kings.
Who wins the trade sending Harrison Barnes from Dallas to Sacramento? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
The Kings sent second-year forward Justin Jackson and veteran forward/center Zach Randolph to the Mavs for Barnes.
The official announcement of the trade came after the game, but news of the agreement broke early in the fourth quarter of the Mavs' win. Barnes, who scored 10 points through the third quarter, chose to remain on the bench and support his soon-to-be-former teammates.
Barnes' agent, Jeff Schwartz, told ESPN's Paul Pierce that he and the Mavericks were working on a trade and Barnes knew that something was in the works with Sacramento. The timing was agreed upon during the game, according to Schwartz, and Barnes wanted to play.
""He's a better man than me, for sure,"" said Dirk Nowitzki, the longtime face of the Mavs who frequently raved about Barnes' character and work ethic. ""Everybody else would have bounced. He's just a generally good dude. He's obviously got bonds with some of these players here for life, and that's the kind of guy that he is.""

LeBron James took to Instagram on Wednesday to point out the hypocrisy of teams trading players vs. players requesting trades.
""So let me guess this is cool cause they had to do what was best for the franchise right???"" James wrote. ""Traded this man while he was literally playing in the game and had ZERO idea. I'm not knocking who traded him because it's a business and you have to do what you feel what's best but I just want this narrative to start to get REAL/CHANGE and not when a player wants to be traded or leaves a Franchise that he's a selfish/ungrateful player but when they trade you, release , waive, cut etc etc it's best for them! I'm ok with both honestly, truly am. Just call a ♠️ a ♠️!!""
The post was liked by Anthony Davis, who has been at the center of trade talks for almost two weeks since he requested to be dealt by the New Orleans Pelicans.
The Barnes deal came on the eve of the NBA trade deadline and a week after Dallas' blockbuster with the New York Knicks to acquire Kristaps Porzingis. Rookie star Luka Doncic is the lone regular Mavs starter left after the two deals.
Barnes left the American Airlines Center without talking to the media but did post on social media later Wednesday.

After the game, Mavs coach Rick Carlisle thanked Barnes in front of the team for ""being the model professional and a great example.""
""I am going to miss him an awful lot,"" Carlisle said. ""We'll miss him an awful lot, but I believe he's going to have a great situation where he's going and we'll just go forward from here.""
Mavs owner Mark Cuban took to Twitter later Wednesday to salute Barnes.
You have been first class on the court and off.  Your voice and actions  in the community have  made a difference    Thank you HB https://t.co/l3drTkJIgr
The Kings want to make a long-term play to keep Barnes, who has a player option on his $25 million deal for the 2019-20 season, sources told ESPN.
The 26-year-old Barnes, who led the Mavs in scoring the previous two seasons, is averaging 17.7 points per game this season but is shooting 40.4 percent from the field, the second-worst mark of his seven-year career. He will join a Sacramento team (28-26) on the cusp of a playoff spot in the Western Conference.
""I don't know too much about Harrison,"" Kings center Willie Cauley-Stein told reporters Wednesday night. ""But just from [scouting], he's always on the scouting board. He's a professional, so I'm sure he's going to fit in perfect.""
The Kings have been active in the lead-up to the deadline, also agreeing Wednesday to acquire Alec Burks from the Cleveland Cavaliers as part of a three-way deal with the Houston Rockets.
After the deals, Sacramento won't have a player on its roster over the age of 30. Nemanja Bjelica is the oldest and doesn't turn 31 until May.
The deal has significant financial ramifications for Dallas, as it positions the Mavs to be aggressive in free agency this summer, despite taking on the combined $31 million in salary owed next season to Tim Hardaway Jr. and Courtney Lee in the Porzingis deal.
The Mavericks now have $13.1 million in room to use at the trade deadline or up until June 30. They project to have $30 million in room for 2019-20, and that number could increase to $40 million if Dwight Powell opts out of his contract.
The Kings will use their remaining $10.5 million of cap space to acquire Barnes. The small forward has an 8 percent trade bonus in his contract valued at $686,443 (as of Thursday). The cap hit for Sacramento is $24.8 million this season and $25.1 million for 2019-20. The Kings will have $21 million in room if Barnes opts in or $45.2 million if he declines his option.

25974418,"He is uncertain if the two are related. At this point, the star guard for the Indiana Pacers doesn't really think it matters.
For now, Oladipo remains in Miami, on crutches, working his way back into shape so he can return to Indianapolis before the end of this season after rupturing the quad tendon in his knee.
""I'm a positive butterfly,"" Oladipo said during a conference call. ""Sure, it might be connected, but who knows. I'm not focused on the past because I have no control over that just like I have no control over the future.
""I've got rehab at 4:30 today. I'm focused on making that the best rehab session I've had.""
There is no timetable for his return to the court.
In his first public comments since hurting the knee on Jan. 23, Oladipo acknowledged that the soreness he felt in November and December was in the same general area as the more serious injury -- just above the right knee. A few days before he went down, while scrambling back on defense against Toronto, Pacers fans openly questioned whether Oladipo was 100 percent and cited, in part, Oladipo's statistical decline.
He averaged 23.1 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.4 steals, all career bests, in 2017-18, when he made his first All-Star appearance and was named the league's Most Improved Player. This season he was averaging 18.8 points, 5.6 rebounds and 1.7 steals. He was selected to his second All-Star team following the injury.
While Oladipo declined to draw a direct link between the initial pain and the ruptured quad tendon, he acknowledged the surgeons removed all ""unnecessary things"" in the right knee.
""In the quad tendon area, yes, very similar. [I was] just doing the necessary things they felt was best to get stronger,"" Oladipo said, describing his rehab regimen from the sore knee. ""It was just a freak accident.""
After beating Toronto on the night Oladipo was taken off the court on a stretcher, the Pacers lost their next four games -- their longest skid in more than 12 months. Oladipo told reporters Monday he was disappointed and felt as if he had let down his teammates.
But Oladipo helped turn things around when he met with his teammates before they played at Miami on Feb. 2.
Indiana beat the Heat 95-88, the first victory in a five-game streak going into Monday's home game against Charlotte. The Pacers are still No. 3 in the Eastern Conference standings, and Oladipo still hopes to play an active role in Indiana's fate.
""If I have my two cents or if I see something, I might text the players or coach,"" he said. ""But for the most part, when they came and visited me in Miami, I told them what I thought they needed to hear. The team is very capable of doing special things without me.""

25974607,"Agents for Hawks guard Jeremy Lin told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski that a buyout with Atlanta is expected to be completed as soon as Monday, and Lin could sign with the Toronto Raptors by midweek.
VanVleet has a partial ligament injury and will wear a splint for approximately three weeks before it is re-evaluated.
He suffered the injury in the second quarter of Saturday's win in New York.
VanVleet is averaging 10.5 points, 4.6 assists and 2.7 rebounds. He averages 26.8 minutes off the bench.
This is expected to make the addition of Jeremy Lin more impactful for Toronto, as he'll immediately step into a key role.

25902807,"Kristaps Porzingis will probably not play for the Dallas Mavericks this season as he continues to recover from a torn ACL in his left knee suffered a year ago, owner Mark Cuban told ESPN.
The Mavs acquired Porzingis as the centerpiece of a blockbuster trade with the New York Knicks on Thursday, believing that the 23-year-old power forward/center who was an All-Star last season can form an elite duo with 19-year-old rookie star Luka Doncic for years to come.
Porzingis, who indicated to Knicks management Thursday morning that he wanted to be traded, will be a restricted free agent this summer. The Mavs made the trade with the plan of signing the 7-foot-3 Porzingis to a long-term deal this offseason. Sources said the organization is confident Doncic and likely-to-retire legend Dirk Nowitzki, one of Porzingis' idols, can help sell him on staying in Dallas.
Team president Steve Mills said the Knicks feel like they did the right thing by trading former first-rounder Kristaps Porzingis. ""You don't want to commit a max [contract] to a player who clearly says to you he doesn't want to be here,"" Mills said.
Mavericks mainstay Dirk Nowitzki said Thursday that the addition of Kristaps Porzingis might give the team a franchise-type player. Nowitzki and Luka Doncic both said they plan on trying to convince Porzingis to remain with the team for years to come.
The Knicks have traded Kristaps Porzingis, Trey Burke, Courtney Lee and Tim Hardaway Jr. to the Mavs in return for Wesley Matthews, Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan and two future first-round picks.
""He loves Luka and Dirk,"" one source said of Porzingis, whose other option would be to play next season on a qualifying offer and become an unrestricted free agent in 2020, an unprecedented move for a player of his caliber that would cost him millions of dollars. The qualifying offer is $4.5 million, while the Mavs can offer a maximum contract worth $158 million over five years.
Dallas sent second-year point guard Dennis Smith Jr., wing Wesley Matthews Jr., center DeAndre Jordan and two future first-round picks to New York for Porzingis, shooting guard Tim Hardaway Jr., wing Courtney Lee and point guard Trey Burke.
The trade opened up enough salary-cap space for the Knicks to pursue two maximum-salary free agents this summer. Hardaway and Lee are owed a combined $31 million next season, while Matthews and Jordan have expiring contracts.
The Mavs deemed Porzingis' potential to be worth the price, considering him a franchise-caliber player whose game complements Doncic's. Porzingis, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2015 draft, was an All-Star last season, when he averaged a career-best 22.7 points as well as 6.6 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game before injuring his knee.
""We obviously think Porzingis is a great young talent, similar in many ways to Dirk,"" coach Rick Carlisle said Thursday on the Mavs' flagship station, 103.3 FM ESPN. ""This is kind of a Dirk-and-[Steve] Nash type of situation, only these guys are taller.""
Porzingis was evaluated in January by the Knicks' medical staff, which confirmed his knee is healing well. He recently worked out with a coach on the court for roughly 45 minutes. The workout included Porzingis shooting pull-up 3-pointers and dunking.
Porzingis will have an introductory news conference in Dallas on Monday.

""At the end of the day though, it is a business. The NBA is a business, and the NBA is going to look out for the best interest of the team and create a team that is going to try and win a championship. At the end of the day, it is a great opportunity for Thon in Detroit.""
Johnson, 22, is averaging 7.5 points and 3.6 rebounds in his fourth NBA season with Detroit. Johnson was the eighth overall pick in the 2015 draft.
Johnson gives the Bucks, who have the NBA's best record at 39-13, another strong wing defender as they prepare for a playoff push. He can become a restricted free agent this summer.
The 7-foot-1 Maker, who is eligible to negotiate a rookie contract extension this offseason, has shown stretches of promise in the league, but he has been in and out of the Bucks' rotation throughout the season. He was part of the team's second unit when Ersan Ilyasova was injured, but forward D.J. Wilson has usurped more of Maker's minutes in recent weeks.
Sources told ESPN in January that Maker, who is averaging 4.7 points and 2.7 rebounds while averaging 11.7 minutes in 35 games this season, had told Bucks management that he would prefer to be traded to a team that would provide a larger role. He'll get an opportunity for playing time with Dwane Casey.
Maker, 21, was the 10th overall pick in the 2016 draft.

25993641,"PORTLAND, Ore. -- Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr was ejected from Wednesday's 129-107 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers after arguing with official Kenny Mauer when a Draymond Green common foul was upgraded to a flagrant foul 1 late in the fourth quarter.
The play in question occurred with 3 minutes, 54 seconds left in regulation and the Warriors trailing 110-103. Green fouled Blazers big man Zach Collins as he was going up to the rim. After the play, officials gathered to review the play and make the upgrade to the more severe foul.
Warriors star Stephen Curry, who spent most of his childhood in Charlotte, is looking forward to serving as an ambassador for the city during this weekend's All-Star festivities.
No matter where he spends the rest of his career, Kevin Durant is determined to set himself up for success for the rest of his life.
That's when Kerr tossed his clipboard and launched into an expletive-filled defense of Green to Mauer. Kerr, who playfully threw out a couple more expletives on his way to meet with reporters after the game, said he still couldn't believe the review occurred in the first place.
""I was just shocked that it was called a flagrant foul,"" Kerr said. ""That was head-scratching that could be called a flagrant foul. I mean, the guy's going to go up for a dunk, you got to make sure he doesn't dunk it. So I told Kenny I beg to differ.""
Warriors star Kevin Durant had to hold Kerr back after the ejection, and Green was whistled for his own technical foul. Blazers guard Damian Lillard hit all three technical free throws, and Collins hit the two free throws from the flagrant foul. With Portland retaining possession of the ball, Blazers forward Jake Layman knocked down a 3-pointer, completing an 8-0 swing of momentum in the span of 20 seconds and ending any hopes of a Warriors comeback on a night when they were playing short-handed without veterans Shaun Livingston, Andre Iguodala and DeMarcus Cousins, all of whom were sitting out to rest.
Green expressed frustration with how he is officiated, after watching the Blazers outscore the Warriors 35-12 in the fourth quarter.
""I got a lot of ball,"" Green said about the play for which he was assessed a flagrant foul. ""I don't know. It's the Draymond rule.""
Green said he appreciated the way Kerr stood up for him at the end of the game.
""I loved that too,"" Green said. ""That was amazing. It's great. He set the tone for us to close the game the way we did. It was good. I got a tech also for standing there; that probably should be a delay of game, not a tech. You can't give somebody a tech because they're standing there. That's a delay of game. But whatever. Probably a Draymond Green rule too.""
Green, who has been among the league leaders in technical fouls for several years and has racked up 11 this season, isn't the only one who thinks he is officiated differently than others in the league.
""Honestly, I think that has something to do with it,"" Warriors guard Stephen Curry said. ""I looked at the replay of that play and the amount of ball that he got. I understand how they classify stuff like that as excessive or whatever, but nothing was excessive about it. He got all ball. I know there's a lot of chirping with Zach involved, there's probably a little sensitivity to it, trying to put out some fires. But I thought it was a terrible call. We obviously pay the price for it with how everything unfolded after that.""
The good news for the Warriors is that they head into the All-Star break playing their best basketball of the season. They were in good spirits heading out of the locker room, as players laughed and joked before departing for a few days off. Durant, Curry and Klay Thompson will head to Charlotte, North Carolina, for the All-Star festivities while the rest of the team gets time to relax.
After all the drama that has surrounded this group on and off the floor at various points in the season, Green said he is confident that the Warriors' best days are ahead.
""It was very trying,"" Green said of the first half of the season. ""We fought through some things, which happens. We're trying to win a, what, third straight championship? It's not easy. So s--- happens, and s--- did happen, and we got through it. Sucks for everybody else. I know everybody else was hoping we didn't. Like I told you all months ago, everybody on this team isn't gonna stop this run. Someone else gotta be lucky enough to do it. And luck might've run out.""
Curry echoed similar sentiments.
""We're locked in on what the goal is,"" Curry said. ""Regardless of the storylines and headlines that have been on our team since October, at the end of the day you understand who's in that locker room, how much we appreciate each other, the true potential we have as a team. And honestly now, with 25 games left, just going to lock in and focus on working out the kinks and raising the level of play so that when the playoffs comes around we feel like we've really hit our stride. We've had two losses, I think, in the last 17 or 18 games. So winning mentality, but there are still things we need to do to get better. And we're all pretty committed to it on a daily basis. That is a good feeling. And it's about basketball and nothing else.""
The Warriors' next game is Feb. 21 against the Sacramento Kings.
""I think we're in a great place,"" Green said. ""We're not playing our best basketball, but I think our chemistry is great and that's the most important thing for us. We got a lot of talent, we got a great team. So long as our chemistry is great, no one can beat us, for real. We're in a great place heading into this break. We got to clean some things up when we come out of the break, but that's the perfect time to clean it up heading into the playoffs strong. So I'm excited about where we're at.""

""Game action photos are used all the time for marketing purposes, but given everything going on, we took the precaution of taking the photo down,"" the Knicks said in a statement Sunday night. ""To be clear, it was one of several rotating photos on the website.""
It is not unheard of for teams to use stars from opposing teams in marketing material. The Knicks, though, have been closely linked to Durant, a two-time NBA Finals MVP, in free agency. The association caused a stir when a Knicks season-ticket holder pointed out the photo in a social media post.
Knicks are asking season ticket holders for renewals by Feb 28 and using this image to get them to opt in. @IanBegley @SBondyNYDN @Schmeelk @TommyBeer pic.twitter.com/Rz3oPZnZMW
The photo was part of a pitch to season-ticket holders to renew their packages for the 2019-20 season. It included a link to learn more about renewal information. The deadline for season-ticket renewals is later this month, and the Knicks (10-45) have tied a single-season franchise record with 16 consecutive losses.
New York hopes to turn things around quickly, beginning in the offseason. The Knicks will likely have a high pick in the 2019 NBA draft and project to have roughly $70 million in cap space this summer -- enough for two max contracts.
No matter where he spends the rest of his career, Kevin Durant is determined to set himself up for success for the rest of his life.
Opposing teams expect the Knicks to be aggressive in pursuing the top free agents in the coming offseason, a group that includes Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving.
Some close to Durant see New York as a possible landing spot for the back-to-back NBA Finals MVP if he chooses to leave the Warriors, according to league sources.

25960564,"Abrines has appeared in only two games since Dec. 23, sitting out because of personal reasons. The team and Abrines mutually decided for the 6-foot-6 guard to be released, with Abrines determining it best to step away from basketball to focus on his personal issue.
Abrines played six minutes against the Magic on Jan. 29, and nine minutes against the Heat on Feb. 1. He was around the team while dealing with the undisclosed personal matter, with the Thunder organization offering as much support as possible.
The second transaction season is officially here.
From choreographed dance moves at the 3-point line to heaving pinpoint passes through traffic, The Beard is putting on a historic show. Are you not entertained?
""He's still battling through some things and wasn't able to be here tonight,"" coach Billy Donovan said Tuesday after Abrines was included on the active roster but was not at the game. ""Honestly, we go day by day with him and continue to be supportive with him. He's around the team, we always talk and communicate.""
Abrines, 25, was selected 32nd overall in the 2013 draft by the Thunder after playing professionally in Spain. He signed with the Thunder in 2016 after four seasons with FC Barcelona, where he was named the EuroLeague Rising Star.
Known for his perimeter shooting, Abrines struggled to find a rhythm from 3 this season, though he hit a career-high seven 3s against Atlanta in November. He was expected to be a significant role player for the Thunder, providing floor spacing alongside Russell Westbrook and Paul George.
Abrines is set to be a restricted free agent this summer, though it's unknown what's next for him in his professional basketball career.
After trading Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot to the Bulls last week, the Thunder are now down to 12 guaranteed roster players. By rule, they will need to add two players within the next two weeks. It's likely they will use 10-day contracts to fill the void while waiting on the buyout picture to clear. Players are eligible for the playoffs as long as they are waived by March 1.
In 31 games this season, Abrines is averaging 5.3 points and 1.5 rebounds per game. For his career, Abrines has appeared in 174 games, averaging 5.3 points and shooting 36.8 percent from 3.

25924855,"Los Angeles Lakers president Magic Johnson made a more robust bid for New Orleans Pelicans All-Star Anthony Davis on Monday, offering multiple young players, including Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma, as well as draft picks and salary-cap relief to the Pelicans, league sources told ESPN.
Johnson and Pelicans general manager Dell Demps had multiple conversations on Monday, league sources said.
The details were not immediately clear on the Lakers' latest offer, but it was an attempt to start moving closer to satisfying the several elements that New Orleans would want in a deal for Davis. The Lakers want to strike a deal before Thursday's 3 p.m. ET trade deadline, but it is still unclear whether the Lakers possess the full complement of assets to make New Orleans act before opening up the process to a broader array of teams, players and draft pick possibilities after the season.
Davis, who is seeking a trade, prefers a move to the Lakers, league sources said.
Here's what each team can really put on the table in trade talks.
Anthony Davis can rejoin the Pelicans in practice after missing seven games with a sprained left index finger.
Our experts pitch their best deals, featuring multiple first-round picks and young players with star potential.
The Pelicans learned on Monday of a new extended list of teams that Davis is willing to stay with long-term upon a trade, including the Milwaukee Bucks and LA Clippers, league sources said. Those teams have yet to make offers for Davis and may not possess the assets to make a trade happen, sources said. The New York Knicks were already on that list, although they were rejected in their offer of a package centered on Kristaps Porzingis before his trade to Dallas, league sources said.
The list doesn't include the Boston Celtics, league sources said. The Celtics are unable to trade for Davis until July 1 as long as Kyrie Irving is on the team's roster. Nevertheless, the Celtics remain determined to acquire Davis after the season and have encouraged the Pelicans to wait until the offseason to engage them on a deal, league sources said.
There appears to be an effort on the part of Davis and his agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, to facilitate a deal before Thursday's trade deadline, and spare a prolonged stay into the offseason for Davis with the franchise. Davis, who requested a trade a week ago, can't become a free agent until July 2020.
Davis informed the Pelicans that he wouldn't sign a five-year, $239 million supermax contract this summer.
The Lakers and Pelicans are expected to talk again soon, league sources said.

#RipCity⁠ ⁠ pic.twitter.com/4dTLXyZedg
The Blazers were Kanter's choice over several serious suitors, including the Los Angeles Lakers, sources said.
The New York Knicks waived Kanter, 26, at the trade deadline last Thursday.
""We're getting a guy who can really score and rebound,"" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said before Wednesday's game against the Golden State Warriors. ""And he'll help us be a better team.""
Stotts said Kanter will be Portland's backup center behind Jusuf Nurkic.
""He's a bona fide player in this league,"" Stotts said. ""You look at his body of work. He's a great rebounder, a great offensive rebounder. He can score and get rebounds in a short amount of time. And I think the role that we have for him will really be good for him, but it will really be good for us, as far as providing a different dimension off our bench.""
Stotts said Kanter will join the Blazers in Brooklyn after the All-Star break.
After Wednesday's 129-107 win over the Golden State Warriors, Portland is 34-23, one game ahead of the Houston Rockets for fourth in the Western Conference standings.
The Blazers signed Kanter as a restricted free agent to a four-year, $70 million offer sheet in 2015. The Oklahoma City Thunder matched the offer, retaining Kanter before eventually trading him to the Knicks as part of the Carmelo Anthony deal in 2017.
New York talked to teams about potential trades of Kanter prior to the deadline, but his $18.6 million expiring contract proved too difficult to move.
Kanter's role with the Knicks decreased in the weeks leading up to the deadline, which led him to express displeasure about his limited role.
He averaged 14 points and 10.5 rebounds, the latter tied for 12th in the league, in 25.6 minutes per game this season for the Knicks. He appeared in 44 games.
In eight seasons with Utah, Oklahoma City and New York, Kanter has averaged 11.9 points and 7.6 rebounds.

25931922,"Los Angeles Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson wants the New Orleans Pelicans to start offering counter proposals to offers on All-Star Anthony Davis, threatening to end talks unless the Pelicans show a willingness to engage in a back-and-forth on reaching a deal, league sources told ESPN on Tuesday.
The Lakers on Monday night added two more young players -- Josh Hart and Ivica Zubac -- to a trade package that already included Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and two first-round picks, sources said.
Johnson and Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka felt like they were beginning to bid against themselves in the process, but insist they'll add nothing more to a deal without Pelicans GM Dell Demps showing an increased engagement with the Lakers, league sources said.
The NBA's trade deadline is Thursday at 3 p.m. ET. New Orleans has listed Davis as questionable for Wednesday's game against the Chicago Bulls.
Anthony Davis is a superstar, but the Lakers have reasons to stop short of a blockbuster trade.
The Pelicans are engaging with the Lakers in talks on a trade for Anthony Davis, but president Magic Johnson must overcome significant support within the Pelicans organization to let Thursday's deadline expire with Davis remaining on the roster.
Our experts give six deals that work, including 10 teams and multiple contenders.
The Pelicans haven't countered the Lakers' offers but do have expectations that Johnson will overwhelm them with young players and a historic haul of draft picks. To New Orleans, that means four first-round and second-round picks as part of a trade package, league sources told ESPN.
The Pelicans want to be compensated -- perhaps even overcompensated -- for bypassing the chance to open up the process in the offseason and delivering Davis to the Lakers now.
The Lakers are fighting both the clock on Thursday's trade deadline and the Pelicans' ability to hold onto Davis into the offseason, when there could be several new scenarios available to them.
Davis' agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, seems to have made some inroads into tightening the trade market on the Pelicans, limiting what some rivals might be willing to offer based on the fear of losing Davis as a rental in 2020 free agency. Paul has worked to keep the process moving toward a perception of inevitability on Davis' preferred future destination, the Lakers, where he could join another Klutch client, LeBron James.
The Pelicans did learn Monday of a new, extended list of teams that Davis is willing to stay with long term upon being traded, including the Milwaukee Bucks and LA Clippers, league sources said. Those two teams have yet to make offers for Davis and likely don't have the assets to make a deal happen, league sources said.
While Paul is providing the Pelicans with clear options beyond the Lakers, questions still remain about those teams' ability to make compelling offers to the Pelicans.The New York Knicks were also on that extended list, but they were rejected in their offer of a package centered on Kristaps Porzingis prior to his trade to Dallas, league sources said.
Absent from the new list are the Boston Celtics, league sources said. The Celtics are unable to trade for Davis until July 1 as long as Kyrie Irving is on the team's roster, based on the fact that they both are under the provision of the designated rookie extension.
Nevertheless, the Celtics remain determined to acquire Davis after the season, and Celtics GM Danny Ainge has directly urged Demps to wait until the offseason, when the Celtics have promised to be aggressive with their wealth of draft and player assets to try to acquire Davis, league sources said. Ainge is eager to trade for Davis and pair him with Irving, sources said.
Boston's plan to pursue Davis remains unaffected by whatever decision Irving might make in summer free agency, league sources said. Irving, 26, previously said he planned to re-sign with the Celtics in the summer but has recently wavered in public on that promise. Although the Celtics can't be sure about Irving's forthcoming decision in July, they remain confident that he'll choose to stay in Boston, sources said. The Celtics also believe that a deal for Davis will help solidify his confidence in re-signing with the organization, sources said.
Still, Davis' camp has been engaged in an aggressive campaign to push back on the possibility of the All-Star center's future in Boston, encouraging the Pelicans to do a deal with the Lakers or another preferred team before Boston has a chance to become active in deal talks in the offseason. The best chance Davis has to force his way to the Lakers is by creating a level of chaos and uncertainty in the marketplace about his privately stated wishes. The league's landscape is certainly feeling the tremors of the campaign by Paul and Davis.
The Celtics could have access to four first-round picks in the June draft. New Orleans is determined that any deal for Davis will include a young player returning to them who has the potential to become an All-NBA performer -- a first-, second- or third-team player, sources said. The Pelicans could wait until the draft lottery in May, when they'll have a better idea of when and how Boston's protected picks in deals with Philadelphia, Memphis and the Clippers could be conveyed in a deal.
Also, the Pelicans could risk improving their draft status and costing themselves the ability to get a higher pick in the draft by bringing back the core of young Lakers players. There's a real possibility that the Pelicans and Davis could agree on a limited playing schedule post-trade deadline, but that's undetermined.
What's more, there's a small possibility that the Knicks could win the draft lottery and become viable candidates for a trade. There are also always three- and four-team trade scenarios that could open up new player and draft-pick possibilities to the Pelicans in the offseason. The Pelicans believe that the Lakers' bid at the trade deadline will still be available to them in the offseason, sources said. Several rival GMs believe that New Orleans could use the Lakers' final offer at the deadline as the baseline for offers in the offseason.
Davis, who requested a trade a week ago through Paul, can't become a free agent until July 2020. He has no plans to sign an extension with any team this summer, expecting to do so when he becomes a free agent. Davis informed the Pelicans that he wouldn't sign a five-year, $239 million supermax contract this summer or next.

The team president and Hall of Famer spoke with reporters at Michigan State, where he and the 1979 national championship team he led were celebrated before the ninth-ranked Spartans beat Minnesota.
The Lakers were in pursuit of disgruntled New Orleans superstar Anthony Davis, and many of their players were mentioned as possibly being dealt before the deadline Thursday. The franchise ended up trading Michael Beasley, Ivica Zubac and rookie Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk in a pair of deals to acquire Reggie Bullock and Mike Muscala.
The two storied franchises have battled for championships through the decades. With the backdrop of a thrilling finish Thursday night, their next battle will come this summer as both teams try to land the coveted Pelicans star.
""I love our team. I love the guys,"" Johnson said. ""It's a tough part of our business whether you're mentioned in trade talk, or you get traded. It's a tough part of professional sports, but they came together and played great against Boston.

25992042,"MINNEAPOLIS -- Houston Rockets star James Harden put himself in rare company Wednesday night, scoring at least 30 points in his 31st consecutive game to tie Wilt Chamberlain (1962) for the second-longest such streak in NBA history.
Harden's dominant 42-point effort, however, was not enough to fend off the Minnesota Timberwolves, who defeated Houston 121-111.
Harden took no solace in his offensive performance. The Rockets are now 0-2 against the Timberwolves this season. Houston is 16-6 when Harden scores 40 or more and 21-10 during his 30-point streak.
""We lost, man,"" Harden said when asked about his performance. His answers to other questions about the Rockets' defensive struggles and intensity issues were clipped.
Unlike the previous game, when it took Harden well into the fourth quarter to reach the 30-point mark, his 30th point Wednesday came in the third quarter on a 3-pointer from the top of the key. He was fouled by Timberwolves guard Josh Okogie on the play and earned a trip to the free throw line.
Early on, it looked like Harden's streak could be in trouble. He was forced to give up the ball often in the first quarter, thanks in part to Okogie's energetic defense. Harden finished the first quarter with just five points.
""We made it hard on James,"" Timberwolves big man Karl-Anthony Towns said. ""Got a little spooky at the end. He's one superb talent in the league. But for the most part, we did a great job. And I think Josh Okogie was fantastic. Our rookies stepped up in a big way.""
An explosive 15-point second quarter put Harden back on pace to keep his streak alive. As he began to heat up from the field, fans began to boo Harden every time he touched the ball. When Okogie sat, Luol Deng was given the assignment of locking down Harden.
Before the game, Timberwolves coach Ryan Saunders said part of Minnesota's defensive strategy for Harden would be limiting his trips to the free throw line. Saunders said that even if his players keep their hands up, there is only so much they can do to limit Harden.
""For the most part, you know you are not going to stop a guy like that -- fully stop him,"" Saunders said. ""You are not going to hold him to zero points. It would be great if you could. Playing without fouling is a big thing.""
Through the first three quarters, Harden shot just four free throws, making all four.
Harden, who was the first player back on the floor warming up after halftime, scored on the Rockets' opening two baskets in the third quarter before sealing his 30-point performance.
After the game, Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said the loss hinged on the Rockets' defensive woes.
""Our offense is the least of our problems,"" he said.
The streak was barely mentioned in the Rockets locker room after the game as the players dressed quietly.
""We sucked on the defensive end tonight,"" point guard Chris Paul said.
Harden would have to keep scoring at this rate for 34 more games to match the NBA's 30-point record of 65 straight games, also held by Chamberlain (1961-62).

1. Golden State Warriors
Record: 40-15
The Warriors will have two starters in the All-Star Game for the fourth time in five years on Sunday in Charlotte. Golden State will have at least three All-Stars for the fourth straight season and first time since 1960-63. Stephen Curry is the first Warriors player to be an All-Star in six straight seasons. -- Spears
2. Milwaukee Bucks
Record: 41-14
After notching six victories in a row -- all by double digits -- the Bucks scored just 83 points in their worst defeat of the season Saturday, a 20-point home spanking at the hands of the Magic. But between Giannis Antetokounmpo not playing and the fact deadline pickup Nikola Mirotic will soon join the rotation, it seems fair to expect that this team will enjoy far more offensive explosions than it will have droughts going forward. -- Herring
3. Toronto Raptors
Record: 41-16
Not to cede any ground in the Eastern Conference arms race, the Raptors added Marc Gasol at the deadline at a relative bargain. What might be just as auspicious for Toronto was Kyle Lowry's week, one of his most productive of the season as the Raps picked up three road wins. Lowry averaged 18.3 points, 8.0 assists and 4.3 rebounds for the week on an effective field goal percentage of 57.7. -- Arnovitz
4. Oklahoma City Thunder
Record: 36-19
The Thunder have won 10 of their past 11 games, including a huge comeback victory at the Rockets on Saturday. Russell Westbrook has stepped into history by notching nine triple-doubles in a row and counting, a span during which teammate Paul George has bolstered his MVP claims by averaging 34.3 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 4.2 APG and 2.6 SPG. -- Snellings
5. Philadelphia 76ers
Record: 36-20
Whether you believe the Sixers gave up too many assets or you believe the moment is now, no team had a more impactful deadline than Philadelphia. The new Philly Phive lineup with newcomer Tobias Harris outscored the Lakers and Nuggets 85-68 in his inaugural week with the Sixers. After a slow start, JJ Redick has been sizzling from beyond the arc in 2019 -- 45 percent on 8.6 attempts per game. If he can sustain it, he has a chance to finish above 40 percent for the fifth consecutive season. -- Arnovitz
6. Denver Nuggets
Record: 37-18
The Nuggets started the calendar year with wins in 14 of their first 18 games but have lost three straight to fall multiple games behind the surging Warriors. Their recent losses align perfectly with the three-game (and counting) injury absence of defensive anchor Paul Millsap, as they allowed 127 PPG without him last week. -- Snellings
7. Boston Celtics
Record: 35-21
The Celtics find themselves at another crossroads this week. They largely stood pat at the trade deadline despite competitors in Milwaukee, Toronto and Philadelphia making big moves that seem to improve their teams on paper. The Celtics are still considered one of the most talented teams in the Eastern Conference, but they might have to adjust to life in the short term without offensive engine Kyrie Irving, who is day-to-day due with a sprained knee. -- Snellings
8. Portland Trail Blazers
Record: 33-22
Will center Skal Labissiere finally get a chance to show what he can do with Portland? The 6-foot-11, 235-pounder averaged 2.8 points, 1.8 rebounds and 8.7 minutes in 13 games this season with Sacramento before being traded to Portland recently. The Haitian did not play for the Blazers in his potential debut in a 102-101 loss to the Mavericks on Sunday. -- Spears
9. Houston Rockets
Record: 32-23
James Harden can extend his streak of 30-point performances to 30 consecutive games on Monday against the Mavericks. For a little perspective on that accomplishment, take a look at the active players who have managed to score 20 points in 30 straight games. It isn't a very long list: Kevin Durant (four times), LeBron James (twice), Harden (twice), Isaiah Thomas, Dirk Nowitzki, Carmelo Anthony and Blake Griffin. -- MacMahon
10. Utah Jazz
Record: 32-24
As Donovan Mitchell noted after Saturday's blowout win, the matchup against the Spurs and All-Star big man LaMarcus Aldridge was personal for snubbed Jazz center Rudy Gobert. It's too bad for Gobert that the Western Conference coaches didn't vote this weekend. He was dominant (21 points on 8-of-10 shooting, 13 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 blocks, plus-15) in a win that kept the Jazz above the Spurs in the standings. Gobert was also a factor in Aldridge's off night (15 points, 5-of-16 shooting). -- MacMahon
11. Indiana Pacers
Record: 37-19
Just when it looked like Indiana was shell-shocked by Victor Oladipo's season-ending injury, with its offense sputtering badly for a week and a half, the Pacers now own the NBA's longest current winning streak at five games. The timing of their solid play couldn't come at a better time, given how tough the Pacers' schedule will become about a month from now. -- Herring
12. San Antonio Spurs
Record: 32-26
Uh, the Spurs have had better weeks. San Antonio dropped its past four games by an average margin of 20.8 points -- all to potential West playoff teams. That's a rough way to start the annual Rodeo Road Trip that still has stops in Memphis, Toronto, New York and Brooklyn. -- MacMahon
13. Sacramento Kings
Record: 30-26
The playoff-hopeful Kings won their 30th game of the season on Sunday against the Suns. Sacramento won only 28 games last season and didn't reach 30 wins in eight of its past 10 seasons. Sacramento is on pace to have its best season since 2005-06, when the team had 44 wins and made its most recent postseason appearance. -- Spears
14. LA Clippers
Record: 31-26
The Clips underwent yet another wholesale makeover, then notched the NBA's biggest comeback in two seasons, knocking off the Celtics in Boston on Saturday despite trailing by 28 in the second quarter. The popular notion is that the Clippers bowed out of the playoff hunt at the deadline as they readied their spreadsheet for the future. But a peek at the roster shows the Clippers to still be a relatively deep team. If Danilo Gallinari and Lou Williams can stay healthy, can the Clips hang around in the race for No. 8? -- Arnovitz
15. Brooklyn Nets
Record: 29-28
Friday night marked the return of Caris LeVert to action, which gives the Nets both a morale boost and some depth in backcourt to compensate for the absence of Spencer Dinwiddie. The Nets have lost by double digits three times in the past nine days. They now enter a crucial stretch in their playoff drive ahead of a brutal, road-heavy March schedule, with Detroit now looking as if it might have some interest in postseason basketball. -- Arnovitz
16. Los Angeles Lakers
Record: 28-28
If not for Rajon Rondo's heroics at the buzzer in Boston on Friday night, the Lakers would be in a free fall, having dropped two games by a combined 65 points to Indiana and Philadelphia. In the four games since his return, LeBron James has averaged 22 points, 10.8 rebounds and 9.8 assists -- numbers indicative of Facilitator LeBron. -- Arnovitz
17. Charlotte Hornets
Record: 27-28
Kemba Walker has scored 30-plus points in four straight games. The Hornets' lone All-Star has scored at least 30 points 17 times this season. Walker has scored a franchise-record 11,285 points, and no other player in franchise history has scored more than 10,000. -- Spears
18. Dallas Mavericks
Record: 26-29
The Mavs' makeover before the trade deadline clearly was focused on the future, but Dallas definitely isn't tanking. The Mavs want to convey the top-five-protected pick they owe to the Hawks from the Luka Doncic deal, and they don't necessarily think trading every starter except Doncic damages their chances, considering that group had the worst plus-minus (minus-58) of any starting five in the NBA. Dallas has won three of four games in which Doncic has played since the blockbuster deal with the Knicks. -- MacMahon
19. Detroit Pistons
Record: 25-29
Detroit, in the midst of a three-game win streak, enjoyed one of its better victories of the season a week ago when it blew out a short-handed Nuggets club. The Pistons shook up their roster, dealing away swingman Reggie Bullock and forward Stanley Johnson and cutting Henry Ellenson to add Wayne Ellington, Thon Maker and Svi Mykhailiuk for the homestretch of the season. After Miami's loss Sunday, the Pistons now sit in a tie for the eighth playoff spot in the East. -- Herring
20. Miami Heat
Record: 25-29
The Heat are halfway through a grueling, six-game road trip in which they already have faced the Warriors, Trail Blazers and Kings and will challenge the Nuggets, Mavericks and 76ers before they return home. The All-Star break will give them a respite before the last game of the trip, which they might need to regroup as they enter this week losers of five of their past six games. -- Snellings
21. Washington Wizards
Record: 24-32
Looking at the writing on the wall following the news that John Wall had ruptured his Achilles tendon during a fall at home, the Wizards dealt Otto Porter Jr. to the Bulls in exchange for Bobby Portis, Jabari Parker and a second-round pick. The move essentially allowed Washington an opportunity to wipe a big contract off the books (Portis is a restricted free agent, and Parker has a team option for next year) while still monitoring whether it would like to keep either player around beyond this season. -- Herring
22. Orlando Magic
Record: 25-32
The Magic took advantage of their unique situation to take a low-risk, huge-reward swing at the trade deadline with the acquisition of Markelle Fultz. Fultz ranked as the best draft prospect and went with the first overall pick in 2017. If he is able to regain his health and form in Orlando, outside of the spotlight and expectations of the larger Philadelphia market, then the Magic could have the future perimeter leader they have needed to complement their talented, young crew of big men. -- Snellings
23. Minnesota Timberwolves
Record: 25-30
The Timberwolves have posted a 6-9 record with four straight losses since Ryan Saunders became interim head coach, replacing Tom Thibodeau on Jan. 6. To Saunders' credit, however, the Wolves have been plagued by injuries since he took over, playing mostly without starters Jeff Teague and Robert Covington and reserves Tyus Jones and Derrick Rose. The schedule doesn't ease up before the All-Star break, with the Clippers and Rockets next. -- Spears
24. New Orleans Pelicans
Record: 25-32
Anthony Davis' playing time will be a central storyline in the Pelicans' soap opera the rest of the season. It's a no-win situation for New Orleans with it all but a certainty that Davis will be traded this summer. There is the obvious injury risk, and Davis is too dominant for the Pelicans to improve their lottery odds much if he's in the lineup, as evidenced by the plus-24 in 59 minutes since the trade deadline passed. -- MacMahon
25. Memphis Grizzlies
Record: 23-34
One factor in the Grizzlies' not pulling the trigger on trading Mike Conley -- aside from teams not meeting Memphis' high asking price -- was his value as a mentor for Jaren Jackson Jr. The rookie is the future face of the Grizzlies franchise, and Conley is willing and able to provide guidance as Jackson grows into that role. Unlike Marc Gasol, who wanted a chance to contend for a title, Conley wanted to stay in Memphis. -- MacMahon
26. Atlanta Hawks
Record: 18-38
Though his shot selection remains league average for an NBA guard, Trae Young has assembled his most efficient stretch of his rookie season over the past nine games. Young has compiled a true shooting percentage of 62 over that span, including a 43.3 percent clip from beyond the arc. All the while, he's distributing more assists and committing fewer turnovers. Next on the agenda? Defense, where Young is the league's least effective player according to ESPN's real plus-minus. -- Arnovitz
27. Chicago Bulls
Record: 13-43
Realizing they wouldn't be a player for the NBA's most coveted free agents this summer, the Bulls swung a deal for forward Otto Porter Jr., who will take up considerable cap space by making more than $53 million over the next two years. But as a two-way talent who doesn't require many shots, he could be a great fit next to Lauri Markkanen (who had three straight 30-point games this past week for the first time in his career) and Zach LaVine (three straight games of 20 points and five assists for the first time). -- Herring
28. Phoenix Suns
Record: 11-47
The Suns lost their 14th straight game of the season at Sacramento on Sunday and are one loss shy of the franchise record for consecutive defeats. Next up for the Suns are the Clippers in the second game of a five-game road trip, which ends with post-All-Star dates in Cleveland, Atlanta and Miami. -- Spears
29. Cleveland Cavaliers
Record: 11-45
Cleveland's matchup with the Knicks on Monday night marks a meeting between a pair of clubs that have combined for just three victories in their past 50 games. But if there was a bright side for the Cavaliers this past week, it was that they got franchise player Kevin Love back from a 50-game absence (because of surgery on his left foot) in Friday's loss to Washington. He played only six minutes but figures to see more time this week against New York or Brooklyn, if not both. -- Herring
30. New York Knicks
Record: 10-45
The Knicks have lost 16 games in a row, and they followed up their huge trade with the Mavericks by cutting veterans Enes Kanter and Wesley Matthews. They did retain DeAndre Jordan, whom they have tapped as the veteran who can help lead the young players on the team. Jordan has averaged 11.0 PPG on 69.6 percent shooting with 12.3 RPG in 27.3 MPG during his first four games as a member of the Knicks, providing the efficient scoring and defense that make him valuable even to a team that is otherwise in full-on youth mode. -- Snellings

25914812,"Thanks, NFL, but we'll take it from here. It's NBA trade deadline week!
Will the Los Angeles Lakers add Anthony Davis for their playoff push? Could Memphis Grizzlies mainstays Mike Conley and Marc Gasol join a contender? We'll find out before the 3 p.m. ET Thursday deadline.
For now, let's see which teams are rising or falling this week, led by the Boston Celtics jumping into the top five after Sunday's win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.
Throughout the regular season, our panel (ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz, Tim MacMahon and Andre' Snellings, The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears and FiveThirtyEight's Chris Herring) ranks all 30 teams from top to bottom, taking stock of which teams are playing the best basketball now and which are looking most like title contenders.

1. Golden State Warriors
Record: 37-15
Steve Kerr has coached in the All-Star Game twice since becoming the head coach of the Warriors. Kerr and his staff were tied record-wise with Mike Malone and the Denver Nuggets to coach LeBron James' All-Stars but lost the tie-breaker. Kerr and his staff are probably not too sad about it, as they could use the break after playing in the NBA Finals the past four years. -- Spears
2. Milwaukee Bucks
Record: 38-13
Milwaukee effectively cut the head off the snake twice this week, limiting Blake Griffin to 18 points (on 16 shots) and Kawhi Leonard to 16 points (on 20 shots) in easy victories over Detroit and Toronto, respectively. Wizards star Bradley Beal got closer to his scoring average with 24 points against the Bucks on Saturday, but it was moot, as Giannis Antetokounmpo poured in 37 in Milwaukee's winning effort. -- Herring
3. Denver Nuggets
Record: 37-15
The Nuggets have been playing this week without Jamal Murray, who is missing time with a sprained ankle, but they continue to prove very robust in the face of injury. They have won six straight games and have caught the Warriors again for the best record in the Western Conference. The Nuggets are led by starting center Nikola Jokic, who earned his first All-Star nod this season and currently ranks third overall in the NBA in Real Plus-Minus. -- Snellings
4. Toronto Raptors
Record: 38-16
When Kyle Lowry was gratuitously snubbed as a reserve for the 2014 All-Star Game, word around the league was that he was being penalized by coaches for his reputation as a difficult customer. Five years later, he was selected as a bubble candidate, as he's not having a particularly impressive season statistically. This demonstrates how far Lowry has come as one of the game's most highly respected game managers, one who impacts play in numerous areas on both sides of the floor even when he's not scoring. -- Arnovitz
5. Boston Celtics
Record: 34-19
The Celtics entered Sunday's game still ensconced in fifth place in the Eastern Conference, but with their win over the Thunder, they left Sunday tied for the third seed with an inside track for home-court advantage in the playoffs. The Celtics still have the third-best scoring margin in the NBA at plus-6.9, just behind the Bucks and Warriors, and with nine wins in their past 10 games, they are trending strongly positive in their quest to better their Eastern Conference finals appearance last season. -- Snellings
6. Oklahoma City Thunder
Record: 33-19
The Thunder had won seven games in a row, including signature wins over the Bucks and at the 76ers, before losing in Boston on Sunday. While Paul George has stepped forward as the MVP candidate from this season's Thunder, former MVP Russell Westbrook has quietly broken out of the worst of his shooting slump. After making only 36.1 percent of his field goal attempts and 24.1 percent of his 3-pointers in 13 games from December to early January, Westbrook has made 44.4 percent of his field goals and 33.3 percent of his 3-pointers in his past six games. -- Snellings
7. Philadelphia 76ers
Record: 34-19
The Sixers and Bucks are the only two teams in the league to rank top-five in both true shooting percentage (Sixers are No. 4) and rebounding rate (Sixers are No. 5). Who will be the Sixers' 2019 Ersan Ilyasova and Marco Belinelli, indispensable contributors who shored up Philadelphia's depth issues during their second-half surge last season? Will those mystery guests surface this week, or will the Sixers wait for the buyout market, where they nabbed that pair last February? -- Arnovitz
8. Portland Trail Blazers
Record: 32-20
The Blazers added some scoring and depth with the arrival of guard Rodney Hood via trade from Cleveland. The fifth-year guard averaged 12.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 45 games with the Cavaliers this season. Hood also got some postseason experience last year playing in the NBA Finals. -- Spears
9. San Antonio Spurs
Record: 32-22
""I wasn't the hero tonight,"" LaMarcus Aldridge said after a 25-point, 14-rebound night in Saturday's win over the Pelicans. He had to give credit to the Coyote, the Spurs' mascot who -- dressed in a Batman costume -- made a diving stop to net yet another bat flying over the AT&T Center court during the game. It was the highlight of a five-game win streak in which Aldridge has averaged 26.4 points and 12.4 rebounds. -- MacMahon
10. Houston Rockets
Record: 30-22
Sure, James Harden still occasionally looks to rest on defense, which is understandable considering how hard he works on the other end to score at historic rates. But Harden is also averaging career highs in steals (2.2 per game) and blocks (0.8). ""He has great hands. He has great anticipation,"" Mike D'Antoni said after Harden's six-steal, four-block night in Utah, a dual feat only Draymond Green and Anthony Davis have accomplished among active players. -- MacMahon
11. Utah Jazz
Record: 30-24
The Jazz roared into the week with nine wins in their previous 10 games and then got blown out twice by potential Western Conference playoff foes missing core pieces -- Portland without Jusuf Nurkic and Houston without Chris Paul and Clint Capela. Do those disappointing results add a sense of urgency in Utah's discussions with Memphis about Mike Conley? -- MacMahon
12. Brooklyn Nets
Record: 28-26
Less than two years after Magic Johnson declared he wasn't a leader and traded him to Brooklyn, D'Angelo Russell was named an Eastern Conference All-Star reserve. Russell becomes the first player since Joe Johnson in 2014 to represent the Nets in an All-Star Game. He's a primary factor in the Nets' surge, posting an effective field goal percentage of 56.9 since the calendar flipped to 2019, up from 49.0 prior to New Year's Day. -- Arnovitz
13. Indiana Pacers
Record: 33-19
Since Victor Oladipo went down on Jan. 23, Indiana has struggled mightily on offense. The Pacers have scored 99.4 points per 100 possessions since Jan. 24, the second-worst offensive rating in the league, ahead of only the Knicks in that span. Domantas Sabonis, in particular, has had a rough go, shooting just 33 percent in those five games, down from 62 percent for the season prior to that. -- Herring
14. Sacramento Kings
Record: 27-25
Keep an eye on center Willie Cauley-Stein, who could be a restricted free agent after the 2019-20 season, as Thursday's trade deadline arrives. The 7-foot, 240-pound center is averaging 13.2 points and 8.7 rebounds. The Kings have two young big men to keep an eye on for the future in rookie Marvin Bagley III and Harry Giles. -- Spears
15. LA Clippers
Record: 29-25
The Clippers are in a fascinating spot as they approach the trade deadline sitting in the No. 8 seed. They will keep their draft pick only if they fail to qualify for the playoffs (where they'd be heavy underdogs against an elite opponent) and have one of the most valuable commodities in the marketplace -- quality players on reasonable expiring contracts. In a sellers' market, would the Clippers entertain dealing Tobias Harris, the heartbeat of this season's overachieving squad? How about Patrick Beverley, a defensive bulldog and proficient long-range threat who could undoubtedly help a contender? -- Arnovitz
16. Los Angeles Lakers
Record: 27-26
Chaos has overwhelmed a Lakers organization with an embattled coach, a superstar at considerably less than 100 percent, grouchy veterans, an itchy front office and a young core that has been told to have a packed bag ready, should the team be fortunate enough to dispose of their services. Amid this, the Lakers find themselves in a fight for the No. 8 seed with not only the Clippers but also the resilient Kings and a Wolves team playing with more confidence. -- Arnovitz
17. Charlotte Hornets
Record: 26-26
When the Hornets host the Clippers on Tuesday, it will be their last home game before the NBA All-Star Game on Feb. 17. Charlotte will then play four road games before All-Star Weekend. Even with the trade deadline coming Thursday, it seems doubtful that the Hornets would trade their only All-Star in free-agent-to-be Kemba Walker. -- Spears
18. Minnesota Timberwolves
Record: 25-27
The Timberwolves and their fans continue to see a roller-coaster ride from greatness back to average with Andrew Wiggins. Wiggins' past six games featured scoring of 10, 31, 16, 28, 40 and 17, respectively. ""We'd love to have more from him than what we had tonight,"" interim coach Ryan Saunders said of Wiggins after a 107-106 loss to Denver on Saturday. -- Spears
19. Dallas Mavericks
Record: 24-28
""We about to have some fun, lil bro!!"" Kristaps Porzingis commented on Luka Doncic's Instagram post after the rookie's 35-point, 11-rebound, six-assist performance in Saturday's win over Cleveland. The plan is to err on the side of caution and allow Porzingis -- a year removed from tearing the ACL in his left knee -- to continue rehabbing the rest of the season, so he'll have to wait to play with Doncic. But the kid is a lot of fun to watch. -- MacMahon
20. Miami Heat
Record: 24-27
The Heat have lost three straight games and seven of their past 10. They maintain the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, but that's mostly because the three teams behind them in the playoff race are a combined six games under .500 in their past 10 games. The Heat have been struggling on offense, failing to reach the 100-point mark in six of those seven losses, which has been too much for even their strong defense to overcome. -- Snellings
21. Washington Wizards
Record: 22-30
At 22-30, Washington isn't where it'd like to be this late in the season. But don't expect the disappointing first half to result in anything big as the trade deadline approaches. Owner Ted Leonsis said this past week that none of the team's three max players -- Bradley Beal, John Wall or Otto Porter Jr. -- will be moved. It's also worth remembering that the Wizards already dealt for Trevor Ariza in December, trading Kelly Oubre Jr. and Austin Rivers to get him. -- Herring
22. Detroit Pistons
Record: 22-29
Coach Dwane Casey has been trying an array of starting lineups, hoping to find a rotation that can produce more scoring (the Pistons are tied for the NBA's second-lowest effective field goal percentage). But it hasn't exactly worked. In fact, Detroit has played three games in a row in which a starting wing player has failed to score. -- Herring
23. Orlando Magic
Record: 22-31
The Magic have won two straight games against the Nets and Pacers, both teams ahead of them in the playoff race. They sit three games out of the last playoff spot but have a tough schedule this week, with games at the Thunder and Bucks that will make it difficult for them to make up any ground in the short term. -- Snellings
24. New Orleans Pelicans
Record: 23-20
It's Anthony Davis trade deadline watch week in New Orleans. The Pelicans either begin what could be a long, painful rebuilding process -- see the post-Kevin Garnett-trade Timberwolves -- or enter an extremely awkward purgatory stage for the rest of the season. But no amount of awkwardness should sway New Orleans to take a low-ball offer from the Lakers instead of waiting for the Celtics to make a bid this summer. -- MacMahon
25. Atlanta Hawks
Record: 17-35
Since New Year's Day, Trae Young and John Collins rank third among the NBA's most common pick-and-roll combinations, and they're converting chances at a healthy rate: 12th among the 58 combos with 100 such possessions. (Young and center Dewayne Dedmon rank third in efficiency.) If the Hawks could clean up their turnover epidemic, they'd have an efficient half-court offense that would rank in the top half of the league. -- Arnovitz
26. Memphis Grizzlies
Record: 21-33
Mike Conley and Marc Gasol are doing their parts to help the Grizzlies get value for them in the trade market. They have excelled since Memphis' plan to shop the longtime franchise cornerstones became public, with Conley averaging 23.8 points, 4.8 rebounds and 7.8 assists and Gasol putting up 18.6 points, 9.3 rebounds and 4.6 assists. -- MacMahon
27. Cleveland Cavaliers
Record: 11-42
Cleveland strung together back-to-back wins for just the second time all season this past week, as backup guard Jordan Clarkson enjoyed showings of 18, 28 and 19 points. If there was a downside, it was that rookie Collin Sexton struggled, logging more shot attempts than points in all three games last week. -- Herring
28. Phoenix Suns
Record: 11-43
When asked about the trade deadline, Suns second-year forward Josh Jackson told The Undefeated last week, ""Anything is possible at this point just because of the record."" It would be shocking if the Suns considered dealing young stars Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton. The Suns do, however, need a veteran point guard. -- Spears
29. Chicago Bulls
Record: 12-41
Forward Wayne Selden has played well lately since replacing injured rookie Chandler Hutchison in the team's starting lineup. He logged 15- and 20-point games against Cleveland and Miami, respectively, and has shot 54 percent from the field and 53 percent from deep in that four-game span. -- Herring
30. New York Knicks
Record: 10-42
The Knicks pulled off the biggest trade in the NBA thus far this season, sending Kristaps Porzingis, leading scorer Tim Hardaway Jr. and Trey Burke to the Dallas Mavericks for a package that includes Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan and Wesley Matthews. Though the move was made more for the future, each of the three new Knicks could represent an upgrade at a starting position for the Knicks. They've lost 13 straight games and 21 of 22, but they could be mildly more competitive moving forward if the vets get minutes. -- Snellings

25927937,"NEW YORK -- Giannis Antetokounmpo peeled back the curtain on his All-Star Game draft strategy Monday night, beginning with his desire to pick Golden State guard Stephen Curry if the two-time league MVP is still on the board.
""I might pick Steph because he picked me first last year, so I have to return the favor,"" Antetokounmpo said after putting up 30 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists in a rout of the Brooklyn Nets. ""After that, I think it is going to be random.""
Per ESPN's Bobby Marks, Rudy Gobert also will miss out on a $1 million bonus for not being selected to the All-Star Game. He will not receive the bonus if selected as a replacement player.
Nikola Jokic of the Nuggets, Ben Simmons of the 76ers, Nikola Vucevic of the Magic and Khris Middleton of the Bucks were chosen for their first All-Star Games.
The 2019 All-Star Game saw Team LeBron rally past Team Giannis at MJ's house. Here's everything you need to know after All-Star Weekend took over Charlotte.
Antetokounmpo, who became one of two All-Star team captains after securing the most votes of any Eastern Conference player, said he plans to sit down and make a list of all the players he intends to select ahead of Thursday's draft. The two-time All-Star will draft second because Los Angeles Lakers Star LeBron James garnered the most overall votes.
Antetokounmpo said he would place an emphasis on drafting first-time All-Stars and teammate Khris Middleton, the only other Milwaukee Buck to be selected as an All-Star.
The team was in Toronto when Middleton found out he had secured a spot in the All-Star Game. At the time, Antetokounmpo joked he would draft his teammate only if Middleton promised to pass him the ball.
""I am going to try to make a team that is going to play hard,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""I think I am going to go with the young players.""
Last year, the All-Star draft was kept secret. This year, it will be broadcast on TNT. The draft will take place on Feb. 7 at 7 p.m. ET. Mike Budenholzer and the Milwaukee Bucks' staff will coach ""Team Giannis"" in Charlotte. Denver coach Michael Malone and the Nuggets' staff will coach ""Team LeBron.""

25913556,"Three days after he was traded from the New York Knicks to the Dallas Mavericks, All-Star big man Kristaps Porzingis suggested in an Instagram post that his ex-team's fans should ""stay woke.""
Kristaps Porzingis will probably not play for the Dallas Mavericks this season as he continues recovering from a torn ACL in his left knee suffered a year ago, team owner Mark Cuban told ESPN.
With the trade deadline just days away, players are taking control of their own destinies more than ever before, and the league's teams are scrambling to keep up.
Team president Steve Mills said the Knicks feel like they did the right thing by trading former first-rounder Kristaps Porzingis. ""You don't want to commit a max [contract] to a player who clearly says to you he doesn't want to be here,"" Mills said.
""The city deserves better than that.... My suggestion for Knicks fans is to STAY WOKE!! Peace,"" Porzingis wrote on his verified account early Sunday morning.
Knicks president Steve Mills said that Porzingis, a restricted free agent this summer, informed him that he ""no longer wanted to be a part of our group"" during a Thursday morning meeting. The meeting lasted less than five minutes, league sources told ESPN.
Hours later, New York traded Porzingis to the Mavericks in a deal that brought back two future first-round picks, Dennis Smith Jr. and two veterans on expiring contracts in Wesley Matthews and DeAndre Jordan.
There has been a strong disconnect between Porzingis and Knicks management in recent years, and it culminated in Thursday's meeting. Porzingis expressed concerns on the state of the franchise and his future with the organization in the meeting, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
Knicks GM Scott Perry said the Knicks were aware of Porzingis' displeasure with the direction of the franchise in recent weeks.
Mills cited Porzingis' time spent at the team facility -- which had decreased recently -- as one sign of his disconnect from the franchise.
""When you try to think about how you want to build your team for the long term, you don't want to commit a max [contract] to a player who clearly says to you he doesn't want to be here,"" Mills said Thursday. ""That would be a disservice for our organization and disservice to our fans.""
Mills noted that both parties seemed to be on the same page at the beginning of the season after New York elected not to extend Porzingis' rookie contract, before Porzingis began showing signs of a disconnect.
New York began to speak to teams about different trade scenarios involving Porzingis in the days leading up to Thursday.
""When the meeting occurred this morning, we'd already been having many conversations with a number of teams,"" Perry said Thursday. ""So we decided to act upon one.""
In doing its due diligence, New York contacted the New Orleans Pelicans about an Anthony Davis trade in recent days. There was uncertainty about Porzingis' desire to play with the Pelicans long term, sources said.
At the time of their trade of Porzingis, the Knicks had several offers for the 23-year-old big man, league sources told ESPN.
But multiple teams interested in making an offer for Porzingis said that they were unable to do so before New York traded Porzingis to Dallas, league sources said.
The Knicks were looking for salary-cap relief and young players or future first-round picks in a trade. So while the Knicks could have fielded more offers for Porzingis -- possibly increasing their return in the process -- the transaction with Dallas seemingly accomplished their objectives.
By clearing their books of the money owed to Tim Hardaway Jr. and Courtney Lee -- who were both moved to Dallas in the Porzingis trade -- ESPN's Bobby Marks projects the Knicks to have a league-high $71 million in salary-cap space this summer. That's enough cap space to attempt to sign two maximum-salary free agents.
New York will target the top players on the market, who are expected to include Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving and Kemba Walker.
Some close to Durant see New York as a possible landing spot for the back-to-back NBA Finals MVP if he chooses to leave the Golden State Warriors, according to league sources.
In addition to Smith, the Knicks will get the Mavericks' unprotected first-round pick two years after they send one to the Atlanta Hawks to complete their draft-day deal for Luka Doncic and another protected first-round pick two years after that, sources said.
Those picks could come as soon as 2021 and 2023 if Dallas does not move into the top five this year.
The Mavs deemed Porzingis' potential to be worth the price, considering him a franchise-caliber player whose game complements 19-year-old rookie star Doncic.
Dallas is hoping to re-sign the 7-foot-3 Porzingis to a long-term deal this summer, and it is confident that Doncic and veteran Dirk Nowitzki -- a player Porzingis grew up idolizing -- can play significant roles in making that happen, a source told ESPN's Tim MacMahon.
Porzingis, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft, was averaging a career-best 22.7 points per game before he suffered a torn ACL in his left knee during a breakout All-Star season in 2017-18. He also was averaging 6.6 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game.
Porzingis will probably not play for the Mavericks this season as he continues to recover from the injury, owner Mark Cuban told ESPN's Tim MacMahon.
Porzingis was evaluated in January by the Knicks' medical staff, which confirmed his knee is healing well. He recently worked out with a coach on the court for roughly 45 minutes, during which he was shooting pull-up 3-pointers and dunking.
Porzingis will have an introductory news conference in Dallas on Monday.

25974240,"Philadelphia 76ers general manager Elton Brand would love to see point guard Ben Simmons reach his full potential and learn at the feet of Hall of Famers, but he's not going to let Magic Johnson do the teaching.
Speaking on 97.5 The Fanatic in Philadelphia on Monday, Brand said the Sixers have not granted permission for Simmons to work out with the Los Angeles Lakers' president.
""[Lakers general manager] Rob Pelinka called me and said, 'Hey, we're hearing Ben wants to talk to Hall of Famers, championship-level players, and Magic is on the list. We need authorization for him to meet up.' And I said 'No.' This is over a month ago, so I said no,"" Brand explained.
Philadelphia's first-year GM was responding to a comment Johnson himself made Sunday.
Lakers president Magic Johnson said the Pelicans didn't act in good faith in their negotiations involving Anthony Davis.
The Lakers have been fined $50,000 for comments made by president Earvin Johnson regarding the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo.
The NBA announced it has fined the Lakers $500,000 for violating the league's anti-tampering rule as a result of the team's actions regarding Paul George.
""[Simmons] reached out to me, not to me directly, to the Lakers to find out if we can get together this summer,"" said Johnson, who was an oversized point guard like Simmons is. ""I said, 'Hey, you got to clear it with the league,' and if everybody -- the Sixers sign off, we sign off, the league sign off -- fine, I will do that. But if everybody doesn't sign off, then we can't get together.""
After Sunday's win over the Lakers, Simmons said he isn't focused on speaking to Johnson ""right now,"" but he touched on why that conversation could be beneficial.
""He's been in multiple situations where he's had to play the 5, and he won a championship that way, and just a Hall of Famer, one of those guys who is in the position I'm in ... I think he can help,"" Simmons said.
Brand seems to be of the mind that things have been made clear to Johnson, whose brief tenure in the Lakers' front office has been marked by accusations of tampering.
In 2017, the NBA fined the Lakers $500,000 for violating the NBA's anti-tampering rule, as Pelinka was found to have had contact with Paul George's agent after the team had already been warned.
The Lakers were again fined in 2018, this time for $50,000, over comments Johnson made about Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo.
More recently, the Lakers actively attempted to trade for New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis, who is represented by Rich Paul of Klutch Sports -- the same agency that represents Los Angeles' LeBron James. Paul and James have been friends since childhood, which led some to wonder if Paul was attempting to align two of his star clients together in L.A. Paul also represents Simmons.

25903463,"NEW YORK -- After the Boston Celtics beat the New York Knicks 113-99 at Madison Square Garden on Friday night, Celtics star Kyrie Irving delayed his walk-off interview to make sure his father, Drederick, could come down to the court and receive Irving's black No. 11 game jersey.
The symbolism of the moment was inescapable. Just a few short months ago, Irving both declared he was going to re-sign with the Celtics this summer and filmed a commercial with his father in which he professed his hope that same No. 11 would be hanging from the rafters a couple of hundred miles northeast at TD Garden someday.
But only a few short hours earlier, Irving, seated not far from where he waited for his father after the game, essentially told the Celtics they were going to have to endure a wait of their own.
""Ask me July 1,"" Irving said, when asked if he remains committed to Boston beyond this season.
Kyrie Irving finds his dad after the Celtics' win vs. the Knicks and gives his jersey to him after his interview with Cassidy Hubbarth.
With less than a week to go to the NBA trade deadline, the NBA has essentially turned into an escalating series of all-in poker hands, with all of them centered on the same mindset: The players, not the teams, control all levers of power in the NBA.
From Rich Paul's public declaration that Anthony Davis wanted to leave the New Orleans Pelicans, to the Knicks trading Kristaps Porzingis to open the door to signing Kevin Durant and Irving as free agents this summer, to Irving declining to recommit to his pledge to remain in Boston long term, it is the players, and their agents, dictating what is happening next.
As for the league's teams? They're scrambling just to try to keep up.
The Davis talks, in particular, have thrown the league into flux in a way it rarely has been before. That has come to include Irving, whose name has been thrust into the middle of all that has happened with Davis and the Pelicans, as well as Porzingis and the Knicks. As the rumors of where Davis might wind up -- and what New York might do with its sudden massive amount of cap space -- picked up speed, Irving's name was continually linked to both of them.
But while Irving said all the right things before this season began, things haven't gone according to plan during it, as virtually everyone involved with the Celtics has been some combination of disappointed and frustrated by how this season has played out so far. That has been especially true with regard to Irving, multiple sources said, due to a variety of factors.
Irving is undoubtedly playing the best basketball of his career -- but it hasn't translated to wins. The Celtics are, in theory, more talented than the team that reached Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals without Irving and Gordon Hayward last season. But Boston is in fourth place in the East, getting there only after Friday's win thanks in part to the Indiana Pacers plummeting after losing Victor Oladipo for the season because of a torn quad tendon.
Irving's frustrations have spilled over to other members of the team. He has repeatedly aired his grievances with Boston's young players -- Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier -- through the media, including after a loss in Orlando last month. It was after that same loss that Irving confronted coach Brad Stevens in the huddle for not calling the potential game-deciding shot for him, and Hayward on the court afterward for passing the ball to Tatum instead of him.
The young players have, in turn, been frustrated with Irving. Hayward, meanwhile, was supposed to be Irving's co-star when he signed with the Celtics in 2017. Instead, his Boston tenure began with the devastating broken leg and ankle he suffered in last season's opening game, and he has spent this season trying to get back to the player he was before, leading to frustration being directed at him (as unfair as it might be) from all sides. The result has been Irving often having to try to carry the Celtics to wins on his own against Boston's toughest opponents.

Even after his declaration last fall that he'd be staying in Boston, Irving indicated that he would have been very intrigued by the Knicks in free agency. So after New York opened up the space to potentially sign both him and Durant, with whom he's friendly, in July, the level of concern about Irving's future in Boston has justifiably increased.
""At the end of the day, like I said, I've spent the last eight years trying to do what everybody else wanted me to do in terms [of] making my decisions and trying to validate through the media, through other personnel, managers, anybody in this business,"" Irving said.
""I don't owe anybody s---.""
The idea of Durant and Irving playing together in New York had been whispered about previously. But now that the Knicks have cleared a path to signing both of them outright, it has quickly exploded into full-on speculation. It has been thought for months that Durant's most logical destination, should he choose to leave Golden State, would be to come East and join the Knicks. Several rival teams this week said that is their full expectation -- and that was before the Knicks, clearly feeling confident about their chances, used Porzingis to push all their chips to the center of the table.
None of this, of course, has any impact on Golden State's thinking, sources said. Even if Durant went to team brass and said there was no chance he was coming back this summer -- and, to be clear, that hasn't happened -- it's not as if the Warriors would consider the possibility of trading him. Their plan, as it has been all season, is to go win a third straight title this spring, see what happens this summer and then act accordingly.
With all that said, July is far away, and there are many Knicks fans here who woke up Friday feeling like the equivalent of Charlie Brown trying to kick the football, only to have Lucy rip it away again. And, truthfully, who could blame them? Remarkably, the Knicks have not signed a first-round pick to a second long-term contract since Charlie Ward -- whom they drafted 25 years ago. In a league full of mind-boggling numbers, that might be the single most unbelievable one.
Porzingis was supposed to, finally, change that. But then came the frayed relationship with the organization under Phil Jackson, then the torn ACL that knocked him out for the final months of last season and all of this one, which set the stage for Thursday's stunning events, even by Knicks standards.
It has been an open secret in the NBA for months that the Knicks have been exploring every avenue to create max salary slots for this offseason, in pursuit of landing Durant and a second star this summer. Rival executives were salivating over the possibility of the Knicks securing a commitment from Durant and another star this summer, only for them to then have to find a way to create the space necessary to actually sign them. Some thought the price for doing so could be up to as many as three future first-round picks, which fits right in line with the roughly $18 million to $20 million rate per pick the league has essentially come to when determining the value of a first-rounder to dump salary.
So the Knicks had a choice: use their young players and draft capital to create the space to pair two stars with Porzingis, or use Porzingis to create the space -- and add additional assets on top of it.
And, for all of The Garden's spin Thursday that this was about Porzingis declaring he wanted to leave New York, in reality, it was the opposite: The Knicks, rightly or wrongly, clearly were not convinced Porzingis was worth offering a max contract this summer. No player in NBA history has turned down a max contract offer coming off a rookie scale contract. It seems unlikely that Porzingis, no matter his level of frustration with the Knicks, would have become the first while coming off a torn ACL that Mavericks owner Mark Cuban told ESPN's Tim MacMahon probably would keep Porzingis sidelined all season.
Instead, the Knicks decided the better option was to use Porzingis to not only clear $50 million in unwanted salary but also to bring back Dennis Smith Jr. and two future first-round picks, assets that could be used in future deals to secure talent, should their free-agent plans play out as they hope they will.
Doing so also opens up another -- albeit extremely complicated -- scenario in which the Knicks could land not only Durant and Irving this summer, but Anthony Davis as well.
First, the Knicks would need to get lucky in the lottery, winning it for the first time since getting Patrick Ewing in 1985.
Second, they would then have to secure commitments from Durant and Irving when they become free agents July 1.
Finally, once they had the two free agents in hand, they'd need Davis to either still be in New Orleans, or be with some other team that would be open to trading him. They then could use the lure of Zion Williamson, coupled with Smith, Frank Ntilikina, Mitchell Robinson and Kevin Knox and whatever other picks the Knicks would potentially have to add to the mix to land Davis in a trade.
Celtics guard and pending free agent Kyrie Irving received a warm welcome from the Madison Square Garden crowd on Friday night, hours after he strongly implied that he isn't fully committed to re-signing in Boston.
Kyrie Irving insists his focus is on winning a championship with the Celtics this season and not on his future. As for re-signing with Boston, he said: ""Ask me July 1.""
Kyrie Irving's future in Boston is now in doubt, and it's having a huge impact on the trade deadline.
New York would've been able to make all of those moves at once had it not stretch-waived the final year of Joakim Noah's contract already. Instead, in this scenario, the Knicks would have to wait to officially trade for Davis until the waiting period before signed draft picks can be traded is complete, so they can include that salary in the deal to make the money work (much as Cleveland did with Andrew Wiggins in 2014).
Even setting that long-shot scenario aside, the Knicks obviously would still be thrilled to land Durant and Irving as free agents in July. And, while sitting courtside Friday morning, Irving did nothing to dispel the notion that was possible.
All of this puts the Celtics in an exceedingly uncomfortable position with just a few short days before next Thursday's deadline. Boston's belief has been that, despite Irving's frustrations and the protestations of Davis' camp that he would only consider Boston as a rental, if the Celtics can land Davis in a trade in June, both he and Irving will happily be in Celtics uniforms for a long time to come, and Boston will have a chance to create a new NBA dynasty.
If not for CBA rules preventing Boston from trading for Davis now, the uncertainty probably would be a moot point, and the deal would already be done. The same holds true for the Lakers, the preferred destination of Davis and his agent: If the Lakers had the assets to get such a deal done, it would already be done. Instead, their collection of middling young talent is seen by few around the league as enough to get this deal done. Therefore it isn't, and it seems unlikely to get done anytime soon.
So now all sides will continue to attempt to project strength, and declare they hold the winning hand, for the next six days until the deadline comes and goes. And as they do, the league will continue to be driven by its players in a way it never has been before.

25956029,"""I guess God is telling me something,"" Wall said Friday of the ruptured Achilles tendon that will force him to miss at least the majority of the 2019-20 season. ""To sit down and get yourself fully healthy. I've played through injuries my whole career. I know a lot of people who played through injuries and don't sit down. That's one thing I don't like to do. If something that's nagging or not broken, I want to play. I guess it kind of caught up to me.""
Wall was already out for the season after having surgery to repair bone spurs in his left heel. The rupture in his tendon was discovered by a team doctor during a follow-up procedure to clean out an infection. His recovery time has been estimated at 11 to 15 months.
""I didn't want to hear it,"" Wall said of the diagnosis. ""I'm kind of glad it happened now instead of when I'm four or five months ahead in recovery, trying to get back on the court, and it happens then.""
It's not clear what the injury will mean for a point guard who relies so heavily on his speed and athleticism. But Wall, whose $170 million ""supermax"" contract extension kicks starting next season, is optimistic about his future.
""All the people that talk negative, like, 'You're not coming back,' that just motivates me even more,"" Wall said.
Wall suffered the Achilles injury after slipping and falling at home.
""I understand I had an infection and getting off antibiotics, I felt like something wasn't going right,"" Wall said. ""I slipped, but I don't think that's the main reason. ... My pain was still the same. I didn't have discomfort.""
Wall averaged 20.7 points and 8.2 assists in 32 games this season. He played in only 41 games last season, during which he had an operation on his left knee. Wall also had surgery on both knees in 2016.
The injury prompted the Wizards to shake up the roster and shed salary by trading away Otto Porter Jr. and Markieff Morris. In Wall's absence, Bradley Beal has thrived as Washington's top scoring option.
""I felt like he should have been an All-Star starter, with the numbers he's put up and carrying this team throughout the year,"" Wall said of Beal. ""You don't see too many other guards doing that other than probably James Harden.""

He shot 1-for-5 from the field and missed all three of his 3-point attempts. Love made two free throws and had a rebound and an assist. He left the game midway through the first period and did not return.
""I was moving well,"" Love said. ""Just rushed a couple of my shots, but just felt really good to be back out there. Our plan all along was to give me one quick blow and get me out of there.""
Love won't play in the second half of a back-to-back at the Indiana Pacers on Saturday.
""Kevin got a quick burn,"" Cleveland coach Larry Drew said. ""The plan all along was to play him about six or seven minutes, and we knew coming into this game that that was going to be the plan. And now, we see how he responds tomorrow.""
Love signed a four-year, $120 million extension with the Cavaliers in July. He played the first four games of the season, averaging 19 points and 13.5 rebounds, before undergoing surgery.
""I don't think I missed this much time, consecutively, in my entire career,"" Love said. ""So, there's going to be no semblance of rhythm or anything like that getting back, especially in six minutes, but the ball was finding me.""
After Saturday's game in Indianapolis, Cleveland will play two home contests -- on Monday against the New York Knicks and Wednesday against the Brooklyn Nets -- before the All-Star break.
""It was fun to be out there,"" Love said. ""I almost felt a little -- this is my 11th year, I've seen a lot, done a lot, but like coming back off the bat, that was a great feeling. It was good to be back out there, for sure.""
Love was naturally getting eager to play.
""I have enough suits to get me through three months, but damn, I'm tired of wearing a suit every game and sitting out there,"" Love said. ""I was happy to wear some different street clothes in here today and put a jersey on and kind of see how it fit, go out there -- and I know it was only six, seven minutes, but it felt good.""

How much of an upgrade is Hood in Portland? Kevin Pelton grades the trade.
Hood had to agree to the trade because his signing of a one-year, $3.4 million qualifying offer last summer with Cleveland granted him veto rights. He'll lose his Bird rights in summer free agency, but his enthusiasm for joining the Blazers on a playoff push allowed for his approval of the deal, league sources said. Portland can still re-sign Hood using one of its exceptions. The Blazers are 32-20 and fourth in the Western Conference.
The Cavaliers are continuing to add draft assets and are still pursuing trades for guard Alec Burks and JR Smith before Thursday's trade deadline. With in-season trades of Hood, Kyle Korver, George Hill and Sam Dekker, Cleveland has acquired seven draft picks -- including a first-rounder and six second-round choices.
Hood, 26, has started 45 games for the Cavaliers this season, averaging 12.2 points, just under his career average. He spent three-plus seasons with the Utah Jazz before getting to Cleveland a year ago as part of a three-team deal.

25952567,"CAMDEN, N.J. -- After reshaping his roster with a series of moves this week, most notably landing forward Tobias Harris in a trade with the LA Clippers, 76ers general manager Elton Brand declared Friday morning that Philadelphia's time to win is now.
""We believe we are in position to contend now,"" Brand said, ""and our moves reflect that belief.""
Philadelphia sent out four players -- including Markelle Fultz, the first overall pick in the 2017 draft -- and brought back five others in three trades, completing a dramatic roster overhaul that Brand hopes will allow the team to return to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2001.
He paid a heavy price to acquire Harris, center Boban Marjanovic and forward Mike Scott from the Clippers. Brand traded two first-round picks -- the Sixers' own lottery-protected pick in 2020 and the Miami Heat's unprotected 2021 first-rounder -- plus the Detroit Pistons' second-round picks in 2021 and 2023, along with forward Wilson Chandler, rookie guard Landry Shamet and forward Mike Muscala.
The Magic have acquired 2017 No. 1 overall pick Markelle Fultz from the 76ers for Jonathon Simmons and two draft picks.
In just 20 months, the Sixers' title timeline shifted so drastically that it left the enigmatic former No. 1 pick behind, then led him out of town.
Can Fultz be the answer at point guard in Orlando? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
""We had to add a player like that when we had the opportunity,"" Brand said of Harris, who averaged 20.9 points and shot 43.4 percent from 3-point range for the Clippers this season.
""We had targeted him as a player we would want if he became available, and we coveted him. We know he fits great into our system and he'll do well.""
With the move for Harris and the one three months ago to land Jimmy Butler, Brand has pushed most of his chips into the center of the table for a team that ended a five-year playoff drought last season and is built around two young All-Stars: Joel Embiid, 24, and Ben Simmons, 22.
""[Simmons and Embiid] rapidly improved over the last season, so the window is now,"" Brand said. ""The opportunity is now. So, once I saw that, we discussed taking a shot at it now, because who knows how long that window is going to be open?""
Harris had 14 points and eight rebounds in 32 minutes in his debut Friday night, helping the Sixers top the Denver Nuggets 117-110.
Speaking before the game, Sixers coach Brett Brown echoed Brand's sentiments.
""I think it is,"" Brown said when asked if reaching the NBA Finals is a realistic goal.
""It's different,"" he said with a laugh. ""But I would feel ... I would feel borderline cowardly to not look at you and say yeah, that's what needs to be the goal. That's what I'm telling the team. That's what our goal should be.""
Harris and Butler can be unrestricted free agents this summer. Keeping both players will be expensive -- almost certainly to the tune of max contracts for each of them.
If Philadelphia were to do that -- along with granting Simmons the max extension Brand has already said he'll get this summer -- the Sixers would soar far into the luxury tax. (Embiid signed a massive deal last summer.) But when asked if ownership had committed the funds to keep this team together, Brand didn't hesitate.
""Absolutely,"" he said. ""I've gotten all assurances from the managing partners that we can bring them back and sign them for what we need to sign them for. A lot of things need to happen before that, but we are all on board to keep this core together long term.""
Before worrying about that, though, the Sixers have more pressing matters to deal with -- namely, sorting out how these players are going to fit together. Brown lost three members of his core rotation -- Chandler, his starting power forward, and rotation players in Shamet and Muscala -- while gaining Harris and four players who should immediately receive minutes off the bench: Scott, Marjanovic and forwards Jonathon Simmons and James Ennis.
One player who won't be part of that mix is Fultz, whose time in Philadelphia came to an end Thursday afternoon when he was sent to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Jonathon Simmons, the Oklahoma City Thunder's protected 2020 first-round pick and the Cleveland Cavaliers' 2019 second-round pick. Moving on from Fultz capped a 20-month saga that saw him play in only 33 regular-season games and spend much of his time away from the team while dealing with repeated issues with his shooting form.
""We expected him to be back some time this season,"" Brand said when asked about the decision to trade Fultz. ""That was our hope. But right now we had a chance to add a player, wing depth, and so we had to go do it now.""
In response to a follow-up question, Brand said that potentially having to reintegrate Fultz during the stretch run, along with the opportunity to at least partially restock some of the draft picks sent out to acquire Harris, were key factors in making the decision.
""Just where we are in the season, integrating him in a month or so when we are hoping he'd come back in two [or] three weeks, whenever that was,"" Brand said. ""To add a piece now, get ready for the playoffs and add some assets, a first-round pick and a high second-round pick, it just felt like the time to do it now.""
Brown said he got the news that Fultz had been traded while seeing it on NBA TV, having missed several messages from Brand leading up to the move happening because he had been talking on the phone. Brown admitted that, in recent weeks, he'd begun to wonder if things would ever work out for Fultz in Philadelphia.
""Toward the end I wondered, and I would be lying if I didn't start wondering a lot,"" Brown said. ""I'd be lying if I didn't feel sad. I felt that. It was two emotions. Sad personally, selfishly, I suppose, that i never really felt like I got a chance to coach him. I never really felt like the city got a chance to see him. I felt sad for that. And I was pleased for him that he had a new start, a fresh start, another opportunity.""
Philadelphia's move to get Harris in the early hours of Wednesday morning sparked a frenetic final couple of days before the deadline for the teams atop the Eastern Conference. The Toronto Raptors added Marc Gasol on Thursday while also clearing several roster spots for potential buyout market opportunities, and the Milwaukee Bucks made one of the more surprising moves of deadline day by getting forward Nikola Mirotic from the New Orleans Pelicans.
Although the Boston Celtics didn't make any significant moves, they did get a boost simply with the possibility of getting Anthony Davis this summer. The Pelicans chose to let the deadline pass without trading the All-Star forward.
""It was an arms race,"" Brand said. ""Teams were trying to get better. I think four of the best teams are in the Eastern Conference. They wanted to get better and I'm glad we took a shot to get better early. We'll be prepared.""

25992982,"DALLAS -- As Dwyane Wade walked to the scorer's table in the first quarter, greeted by a mix of boos and cheers, Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle summoned Dirk Nowitzki to also check into the game for the first time.
The two-time NBA Finals foes whose relationship used to be ""frosty,"" as Nowitzki puts it, stood next to each other and shared a laugh before entering the game together with 5:11 remaining in the first quarter. Nowitzki broke the ice by cracking a joke about Wade wrapping up his pregame warm-up by recreating the rebound and ball-throwing celebration from the last seconds of the Heat's title-clinching victory in Game 6 of the 2006 NBA Finals on this floor.
""I was like, 'That's bringing some bad memories back,'"" Nowitzki said. ""He was like, 'I had to do it. This was the building where everything started for me.' It was basically his coming-out party, the '06 Finals, and he hasn't looked back since. It's been a great career for him.""
Wednesday also was a great night for Wade, who bid farewell to the American Airlines Center by scoring 22 points in 22 minutes to lead the Heat to a 112-101 win in their finale before the All-Star Game, when Wade and Nowitzki will meet again after being appointed as special additions by NBA commissioner Adam Silver.
Wade's final moments on the American Airlines Center court, where he has fond memories from 2006 and bitter memories from the Finals rematch with the Mavs five years later, were spent swapping jerseys with Nowitzki.
""I appreciate this, man,"" Wade told Nowitzki during the exchange. ""It's an honor. It's an honor, man. Thank you for everything that you've done for my career.""
Their rivalry grew icy after the Heat won the 2006 title, when Wade took offense to the Mavs' implication that officiating decided the series and snapped back months later by declaring that Dallas would have won the series if Nowitzki had been the leader it needed.
Wade added to the animosity when he, along with LeBron James, pretended to cough in front of cameras during shootaround before Game 5 of the 2011 Finals, mocking Nowitzki after he played with a 101-degree fever in the Mavs' Game 4 win.
But the hard feelings are water under the bridge, according to both future Hall of Famers. The jersey swap, a routine Wade is carrying out with opponents throughout the league during the retirement tour he has dubbed ""One Last Dance,"" provided proof of the mutual respect that has developed between the rivals.
""One of my best jersey swaps of the year,"" Wade said. ""To be able to have that, he's a Hall of Famer, somebody that obviously I've grown to have so much respect for. So, I'm just thankful that he didn't turn me down and say no, so I appreciate it.""
Nowitzki joked that he felt ""naked"" while wearing only his tank-top undershirt on his upper body during the first on-court jersey swap of his career. Nowitzki, 40, has gone to great lengths to avoid an official farewell tour, acknowledging that he is leaning toward retiring at the end of this season, his 21st campaign, but delaying the decision until the summer. But he was glad he played a role in Wade's.
""It's a long time coming knowing that he's been doing that,"" said Nowitzki, who scored 12 points in 17 minutes on Wednesday. ""I'll cherish his jersey, obviously, knowing the great competition we've had for a long, long time. He's a great, great player, one of the greatest guards we've had in our league.
""Like I said, there was some rough, rocky times in our relationship after '06. It went both ways. There was some stuff said we both didn't like, but at the end of the day, we're both competitors. You don't love most of your competition. But we're in this together. We're all family, and I'm happy for him. He had a heck of a career.""
Wade was listed as questionable against the Mavs because of an illness after missing shootaround, but the 37-year-old admitted that Heat coach Erik Spoelstra basically just allowed him to stay at the hotel and get a little extra rest. Wade arrived at the American Airlines Center especially energetic, excited to play for his final game in an arena that was the site of extreme highs and lows in his career.
""It's one of those bittersweet kind of vibes,"" Wade said. ""I've obviously had a lot of great memories here and a lot of not-great memories here, as well. Definitely bittersweet, but I enjoyed the environment tonight. There was a lot of support, a lot of fans, a lot of love, and I appreciate it.
""It was fun, man. It's moments where you go through this, for me this last dance, there's certain games that they are games. Then there are certain ones that are a little bit more special. To be able to play against Dirk and to be able to come here, where there are a lot of memories, this was different than some other games that I've played and that I probably will play. I had fun with tonight.""
There were many Mavs fans with long memories who booed Wade -- considered a villain in Dallas since 2006 -- every time he touched the ball.
But there also were hundreds of fans wearing No. 3 Heat jerseys in the sellout crowd. They cheered loudly for Wade throughout the game and chanted, ""We want Wade! We want Wade!"" in the final minutes.
All of the fans were treated to vintage efforts by both all-time greats after they checked in together in the first quarter, with Wade scoring seven points and Nowitzki scoring six points in the frame. There was an especially memorable sequence featuring the two legends, with Wade swishing a corner 3-pointer over Nowitzki on one end and Nowitzki hitting a turnaround jumper after posting up Wade on the ensuing possession.
""There's a great karma to each one of them,"" Spoelstra said. ""They are both winners, but humble winners. They have tremendous class. And as soon as Dwyane got his opportunity to go one-on-one against him in the corner, you just knew that somehow Dirk was going to get him with an opportunity on the other end.
""They are both ultimate winners, and they are the faces of winning franchises for a reason. They've both won at the highest level with dignity and grace, which is different than most. Fans root for that.""

""As a global celebration of basketball, our All-Star Game is an ideal setting to salute these first-class NBA champions and Finals MVPs,"" Silver said in a statement.
Wade, a Miami Heat mainstay, has said this will be his final season, calling this year ""one last dance.""
""I appreciated my fans for voting for me, but I didn't want to be put in position to take a roster spot from someone who's getting their first opportunity to go to the All-Star Game or their second or third,"" Wade said. ""I've had 12 chances at it. For the commissioner to create that opportunity for Dirk and myself, it's cool. I appreciate it more getting in this way, so I'll be there.""
Nowitzki, the leading scorer in NBA history among foreign-born players, has suited up this year for a record 21st season with one franchise, the Dallas Mavericks. Unlike Wade, Nowitzki has not publicly stated whether this is his final season.
The 40-year-old German now comes off the bench for the Mavs and is averaging career lows of 4.4 points and 1.6 rebounds per game.
Wade, 37, is averaging 13.8 points and 3.7 rebounds per game as he continues to contribute for the Heat as a reserve.
The two have twice faced off in the NBA Finals, with Wade's Heat winning in 2006 and Nowitzki's Mavs claiming the title in 2011.
""I'm glad I can share this opportunity with Dirk, one of the game's greatest players, someone that I've had battles against,'' Wade said. ""It's only right.''
""We've been competing together for a long, long time,"" Nowitzki said of Wade while appearing on ESPN's The Lowe Post podcast with Zach Lowe. ""I think this is special for both of us.""
Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who is planning a beach getaway over the All-Star break and wasn't thinking about watching the All-Star matchup, said he might have to amend his plans and be in front of a television for the game.
""I thought it was great,'' Spoelstra said of Silver's gesture. ""Very cool.''
James has the top pick in the third round, which will be the one that includes Nowitzki and Wade -- his former teammate in Miami, close friend and fellow 2003 draft alum.
""He better pick me,'' Wade said.

25947088,"Before Tuesday's game against the Toronto Raptors, Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown was asked if Markelle Fultz was going to return to the rotation sometime this season.
""Right now I'm hoping to be pleasantly surprised with how he arrives back with us, more than assume he's going to be there,"" Brown said.
What Brown couldn't say was what everyone in the room already knew: Fultz's time in Philadelphia was all but over. The 76ers' timeline no longer allowed for Fultz to work himself back into anything even remotely resembling the form that made him the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2017.
Hours later, Philadelphia made that abundantly clear by trading a bundle of players and picks for Tobias Harris -- the team's second all-in move in less than three months. Adding Harris gave the Sixers one of the best starting lineups in the NBA. It also left them with a second big-money free agent to have to potentially re-sign this summer, and the same problem they had before trading for either Jimmy Butler or Harris: a weak bench.

Fultz, in his current state, was a factor in both of those problems. The $10 million in salary he is owed for next season would have made it difficult to give both Butler and Harris big contracts as free agents while avoiding the luxury tax. Meanwhile, while working his way back from his thoracic outlet syndrome diagnosis, Fultz was taking up a roster spot, limiting the Sixers' ability to improve their bench either in a trade or on the buyout market.
After going all-in by trading for Butler and Harris, keeping Fultz simply didn't make sense. So less than a half-hour before Thursday's 3 p.m. trade deadline, Sixers general manager Elton Brand made the only decision he could by trading Fultz to the Orlando Magic for forward Jonathon Simmons, Oklahoma City's 2020 first-round pick and Cleveland's 2019 second-round pick.
And, just like that, the Markelle Fultz era in Philadelphia was over -- in far different fashion than anyone could have imagined when it began.
June 19, 2017, was supposed to mark the dawn of a new era in Philadelphia.
It was that day that the 76ers agreed to a massive trade with the Boston Celtics, sending the third pick in that year's draft and a future first-rounder to Boston in exchange for the No. 1 overall pick. Philadelphia did so to take Fultz, the dynamic combo guard out of Washington who was almost universally seen as the top pick in the draft and, more important, looked to be an ideal fit alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, the team's two other young anchor talents.
That trio was supposed to carry the Sixers forward for the next decade, be the foundation of a new Eastern Conference powerhouse and serve as the culmination of ""The Process"" -- the moniker given to former general manager Sam Hinkie's systematic teardown of the franchise in an effort to accumulate as many assets as possible, a quest designed specifically to acquire just those types of players.
But rather than marking the dawning of a new day in Philadelphia, June 19, 2017, came to signify the beginning of an excruciating 20-month process that saw Fultz go from a face of the franchise to a face the public hardly ever saw. That shift led the Sixers in a very different direction, one that quickly left Fultz behind.
In theory, Fultz should have been the perfect person to pair with Simmons and Embiid. After watching Fultz play during his lone season at Washington, one high-ranking NBA executive compared him to Dwyane Wade. Standing 6-foot-4 with long arms and blazing speed, Fultz was capable of slicing through defenses and getting to the rim, could make plays for others and showed enough shooting ability -- hitting 41.2 percent of his 3-point attempts on just over five attempts per game -- to allow him to pair nicely with Simmons in Philadelphia's backcourt.
But that's all Fultz turned out to be in Philadelphia: a thought exercise. Regardless of what it was that caused his shooting form to desert him -- and plenty of theories have been floated -- it only matters now that it did. And, when it did, Fultz did, too. He missed the vast majority of last season, then played only 19 games this season before going on hiatus yet again.
Tracy McGrady says he's pleased to hear about Markelle Fultz's trade to the Magic.
Some glimmers of the player he was expected to be occasionally shined through, like when he became the first teenager in NBA history to record a triple-double last season. Far more often, though, he was shrouded in mystery, forcing the Sixers to answer one question after another about him and his status.
Would he play? Would he start when he did? Had his shot returned? Would it ever?
Meanwhile, Simmons and Embiid took the court together and turned the Sixers into a top-four team in the East without Fultz. Their combined talents were enough to somewhat overcome the fact Philadelphia had essentially gotten nothing from a player it had invested significant draft capital specifically to get.
Philadelphia initially tried to change that this season. In an attempt to show faith in Fultz, Brown moved him into the starting lineup to start the season, breaking up what had been the NBA's best five-man lineup in 2017-18. Almost immediately, that plan fell apart.
What began as Fultz starting turned into Fultz starting only the first half of games by the end of the preseason. It quickly became clear that despite having worked on it all offseason, Fultz's jump shot was nowhere near fixed. All pretenses of Philadelphia being a team that had time to allow Fultz to find himself disappeared in mid-November, when the Sixers pushed their chips into the center of the table by trading for Butler.
Fultz was dropped from the starting lineup for good in Butler's debut on Nov. 14 in Orlando and excised from the rotation completely the following Monday when T.J. McConnell helped engineer a second-half comeback against the Phoenix Suns with Fultz watching from the bench.
That was the last time he ever played for the Sixers.
After a flurry of trades, which teams are looking worse and which ones got stronger?
How does this deal change each team? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
Can Fultz be the answer at point guard in Orlando? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
Soon after, Fultz saw a series of specialists, was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome and began a rehabilitation program. But even after returning to the bench, there was never any indication he was going to return to the rotation.
Perhaps the Markelle Fultz era in Orlando will go differently than the one in Philadelphia did. In truth, the Magic are just about the perfect place for him to land. Rather than being under an unforgiving microscope analyzing his every shot and movement as a failed former No. 1 overall pick in Philadelphia, Fultz can just be a backup guard on the Magic, a team sitting outside the East's playoff picture with virtually no media attention.
Orlando's front office, led by team president Jeff Weltman and general manager John Hammond, can afford to be patient with his progress. The team's coach, Steve Clifford, has precisely the right approach and temperament to help coax Fultz's game back to life. But, more than anything, the Magic have time to let Fultz attempt to work things out, to play, to potentially get himself right.
Time was the one thing, though, that Philadelphia no longer had. By trading for Butler and Harris, Philadelphia went from a team with an eye on the future to one entirely focused on the present.
Markelle Fultz wasn't going to be part of that present -- and, therefore, he couldn't be part of Philadelphia's future.
Thursday, the Sixers ensured he wouldn't be.

25935392,"PHILADELPHIA -- In the wee hours of Wednesday morning, what already has been a wild NBA trade deadline received another boost when ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the Philadelphia 76ers completed a blockbuster deal with the LA Clippers for forward Tobias Harris.
The full deal -- Philadelphia getting Harris, center Boban Marjanovic and forward Mike Scott in exchange for forward Wilson Chandler, guard Landry Shamet, center Mike Muscala, Philadelphia's 2020 first-round pick, the Miami Heat's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and two second-rounders -- has wide-ranging implications around the league.
Here's a quick rundown:
1. Philadelphia's star-laden starting five
By adding Harris -- and not sacrificing any of their top four players to do so -- Philadelphia now has a starting five of Ben Simmons, JJ Redick, Jimmy Butler, Harris and Joel Embiid. The only team that can compare to them in the league at this point are the Golden State Warriors. After this move, Philadelphia can at least dream about reaching the NBA Finals this June.Editor's PicksTrade grades: Big winners in the blockbuster Tobias Harris dealHow does this deal change each team?

How does this deal change each team? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
Anthony Davis is a superstar, but the Lakers have reasons to stop short of a blockbuster trade.
Harris is the ideal piece to slot in next to Philadelphia's other stars. He's a terrific shooter (hitting 43.4 percent of his 3-pointers this season, and shooting just less than 50 percent overall) and can fit in tandem with any of Philly's stars -- something that will matter greatly as the Sixers are going to be searching for plenty of depth. But Philadelphia should be able to have a minimum of two, if not three, of these five on the floor at any one time, which can help mitigate those depth issues.
2. A full-scale search for a bench
Even after making this move for Harris, Philadelphia is still staring at the glaring weakness it had before doing this deal: athleticism off the bench. Scott will replace Muscala as the team's backup power forward (where he's actually a better fit), while Marjanovic will give them an intriguing look against bigger backup big men and Jonah Bolden can possibly get spot minutes against smaller ones.
Among backup guards and wings, though, here is Philadelphia's current assortment of players: T.J. McConnell, Furkan Korkmaz, and injured guards Markelle Fultz and Zhaire Smith. Assuming Philadelphia doesn't turn Fultz into players who can help now -- and coach Brett Brown said Tuesday Fultz isn't anywhere close to returning -- expect the Sixers to be a heavy player for any guard on the buyout market who springs free. Wesley Matthews is the most obvious name, but any other that pops up will immediately garner interest. Corey Brewer also is likely to make a return to the roster once the deadline passes.
3. Clippers retooling ... and resetting
One of the questions executives around the league have been pondering over the past several weeks is the Clippers' direction at the deadline. Facing the possibility of handing over their first-round pick if they make the playoffs, would the Clippers actually go for it? Or would they instead pivot and use their many interesting players on expiring deals to net future assets?
LA chose the latter. And doing so netted the Clippers an incredible haul in all of these picks. That doesn't even include Shamet, who has been one of the most pleasant surprises from this rookie class.2019 NBA trade deadlineWe've got you covered on the biggest deals going down at the NBA trade deadline.• All the trades, grades and intel

Now the Clippers will be able to continue into the summer with their plan to land a pair of star free agents (led by Kawhi Leonard, their top and most likely target) while also not having to worry about the possibility of losing out on their backup plan in Harris, who was likely to draw heavy interest himself once free agency began. It also adds to their coffers for a potential trade for a star either now, this summer or beyond.
4. The race to the top of the Eastern Conference just got tougher
Assuming Philadelphia is able to pull this off and keep Simmons, Butler, Harris and Embiid together long term, the Sixers should be a threat in the East for years to come. More importantly, they clearly are going for it this season.
The question now is how do the other contenders -- the Boston Celtics, Toronto Raptors and Milwaukee Bucks -- react? The Bucks have likely already made their big moves, while the Celtics have to wait until the offseason to make the swing they've been plotting for years -- trying to land Anthony Davis. (Note: The Clippers almost certainly missing the playoffs also means that Boston will have to wait to see if it can get their pick in 2020. If the Clippers miss the playoffs this season and next, that first becomes two second-round picks.)
That leaves the Raptors as the team most likely to counter with an aggressive move, and it won't be a surprise if Toronto does something significant between now and Thursday afternoon.
The Raptors have every incentive to go for it this season. Leonard is a free agent and Toronto has always had to play catch-up to try to convince him to stay. Masai Ujiri has never been scared of making a move. Whether the Raptors can find the right move remains to be seen, but don't expect them to let the deadline pass without turning over every possibility.
5. The race to the bottom of the Western Conference just got easier
This also should clear the path for the No. 8 seed to go to the Los Angeles Lakers, Sacramento Kings or Minnesota Timberwolves. Even if the Clippers might be able to hang in the race without Harris, it's hard to imagine they will stop selling now. And if they do continue to strip away players from the roster, they'll ensure they slip down the standings.
However, the Lakers, Kings and Wolves will all be pushing to make the playoffs. The Lakers are still chasing Anthony Davis but lost by 42 points to the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday. They could be active whether they get Davis or not, and already traded for Reggie Bullock to give them a defensive presence on the wing. The Kings -- the NBA's biggest surprise this season -- would seem to now only be more determined to get a small forward to help stop the league's longest playoff drought.
And while Minnesota suffered a brutal loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday, the Wolves are only 1.5 games behind the Lakers. Make no mistake, either: The Wolves would absolutely love to make the postseason after firing Tom Thibodeau earlier this season.

25949791,"""I never slept [last night],"" he said. ""Around seven or eight this morning after checking my phone a thousand times, I didn't know. I did not know. I was prepared for either. What happens, happens. But I'm here.""
Veteran center Marc Gasol, who is averaging 15.7 points, 8.6 rebounds and a career-high 4.7 assists this season, is headed from Memphis to Toronto as part of a four-player trade.
In addition to trading Marc Gasol to Memphis on Thursday, the Grizzlies sent Garrett Temple and JaMychal Green to the LA Clippers and Shelvin Mack to the Atlanta Hawks.
Who wins this big trade? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
Conley received a call from Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace a few minutes before the deadline ended at 2 p.m. CT, informing him he wouldn't be traded.
""At that point I tried to lock back in on Oklahoma City and tried to not let too much emotion carry me out through the day,"" Conley said. ""It was still really hard to function, so I'm just happy I got through it.""
Conley described it as an emotional, difficult day for both himself and the Grizzlies franchise as cornerstone Marc Gasol was traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright, CJ Miles and a 2024 second-round pick.
""Man, it was a long day. A long day,"" he said. ""Normally I'm worried about the game, watching film, doing things like that. [Today] I'm sitting downstairs in the lobby until 1:30, 2:00, waiting for the trade deadline to pass, trying to figure out if I'm gonna be here or not. And to see Marc end up going, and [JaMychal Green] and Garrett [Temple], and just your whole team all of a sudden change. It's hard to lose guys that you consider brothers, and I consider every one of those guys -- Marc, J-Mike, Garrett -- they've all played parts in all of our careers, especially mine.""
Conley, 31, was involved in trade discussions in the past week, with his name connected to a number of teams.
""After they put my name out there, if y'all do it, y'all do it,"" he said. ""But this is all I know. Memphis is all I know. I didn't necessarily ask for any of this to begin with, but I also understood our situation. I'd be one of the players that could hold some value in the trade market. Me being a pro, I just took that and understood it.
""Everything was happening within 10 or 15 minutes of each other, and at that point it started getting real for me thinking, 'Everyone else is going, it might be my turn next,'"" he said. ""But for it not to happen, I told my dad I gotta go to my room and take a nap and get ready for the game and try to sleep, because I hadn't slept in two or three days. I'm just happy to have gotten through this one, because I don't even know how I played it to be honest with you.""
Conley struggled in a 117-95 loss to the Thunder, scoring 15 points on just 4-of-15 shooting, after starting 1-of-9 from the floor.
""You try to prepare yourself as best you can, knowing it's possible Marc will not be with us come the trade deadline,"" Conley said. ""You think you've kind of figured it out, think you're ready for it, but when it happens it's completely different, the locker room is a completely different feel. You get out there to play and you're bringing the guys into a huddle and there's no Marc. It's like, I'm the oldest guy here now. I've gotta be the voice for every huddle and everything we do. It's a different thing and I think it'll take some time to adjust, for all of us.""
Gasol and Conley have been the heart and soul of the Grizzlies for nearly a decade, elevating the franchise to a Western Conference playoff mainstay for multiple seasons and leading them to a conference finals appearance in 2013. Trading Gasol marks the end of an era in Memphis, and the beginning of a rebuild that Conley might or might not eventually be part of.
""He is an icon that you don't replace, and there is no replacing Marc Gasol here in Memphis,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""What he's meant to this team, our city, our fanbase, all those things. Obviously Mike Conley is still here, but Mike's gonna need some help. So someone new is going to have to step up and maybe get out of their comfort zone and replace that role. But there is no replacing what Marc has done here and meant to this team.""
Conley said he talked to Gasol a number of times throughout the day, and texted after the trade went down with the Raptors, but hadn't connected via phone yet and was hoping to after he left the arena Thursday.
""Love big fella,"" Conley said. ""I know he's gonna do well in Toronto. I'm happy for him. He's gonna have a chance to do some big things there.""

25935274,"The LA Clippers and Philadelphia 76ers made a blockbuster deal, it was announced Wednesday, sending forward Tobias Harris to partner with the Sixers' Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Jimmy Butler in pursuit of an Eastern Conference title.
The Sixers paid a steep future price to the Clippers, including rookie guard Landry Shamet, Philadelphia's own 2020 protected first-round pick and an unprotected 2021 first-round pick via the Miami Heat.
Anthony Davis is still a Pelican, but big names like Marc Gasol and Markelle Fultz are on the move. Get the latest news and analysis, including trade grades and after-the-buzzer updates.
The Sixers (34-20) also sent forwards Wilson Chandler and Mike Muscala and 2021 and 2023 second-round picks to the Clippers (via the Detroit Pistons) in the trade. Center Boban Marjanovic and forward Mike Scott were shipped to the Sixers.
""We are in the unique position to contend now and we think this trade positions us well for the postseason,"" Sixers general manager Elton Brand said in a statement. ""Tobias is one of the best three-point shooters in the NBA and possesses an innate ability to impact the game on both ends of the floor, while Boban and Mike provide valuable skillsets, size and depth to our team. All three players bring high character to our locker room and we are excited about their fit alongside Joel, Ben, Jimmy and our entire roster.""
The Clippers (30-25) wanted to move themselves into contention as players in the marketplace for stars wanting to get to the Los Angeles market, and the picks could go a long way to building a significant arsenal. The Clippers didn't make the deal specifically to pursue New Orleans Pelicans center Anthony Davis, sources said, but for star players like him who invariably become available in the marketplace.
Davis included the Clippers on a list of teams he would be willing to commit to long term if traded, but Clippers president Lawrence Frank and general manager Michael Winger didn't make Wednesday's trade with the primary objective to pursue Davis, league sources said. New Orleans could have interest in the Clippers' assets prior to Thursday's trade deadline -- and perhaps again in the offseason if Davis remains on the Pelicans' roster.
It is the second significant deal of the season for Brand, a first-year GM who brought Butler and then Harris to the Sixers' lineup. Along with Butler, Harris will be a free agent this summer, and the Sixers plan to be aggressive in re-signing him to an extension, league sources said.
The Clippers considered Harris, 26, close to a max-level player in the marketplace, and that would've been difficult for them to afford with the franchise's lofty free-agent aspirations. The Clippers are planning to pursue several All-NBA-caliber players, including Toronto Raptors forward Kawhi Leonard. The Clippers have salary-cap space to sign two maximum-contract players.
Harris is having his best NBA season, averaging 20.9 points on 50 percent shooting from the field and 43 percent from the 3-point line.
The trade improved the Sixers' odds of winning the NBA title from 16-1 to 10-1 at the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook. Philadelphia's odds of winning the Eastern Conference also jumped from 5-1 to 9-4 at the SuperBook.
The Sixers traded for the Miami pick on draft night, a selection that originally was included in the Phoenix Suns' acquisition of Goran Dragic in 2014.

25958907,"""I've been eager to get back on the court since I was cleared to play on Dec. 21,"" Parsons told ESPN on Saturday. ""I'm glad the Grizzlies are giving me that opportunity. I've been training hard in Los Angeles for the last month and hoping I'd get a chance to play again this season. I'm ready to get back to Memphis and help my team win any way I can.""
Parsons has been training in Los Angeles for the past month due to a mutual decision with Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace about his path to returning to NBA action after a lengthy absence caused by soreness in his left knee.
Parsons was cleared to play on Dec. 21, but Wallace twice asked him to go on extended assignments with the G League's Memphis Hustle with no guarantee of a return to the Grizzlies' active roster -- requests that Parsons denied.
Unable to sleep leading up to the trade deadline, Memphis guard Mike Conley said he was happy to make it through the day. While many teammates were traded, he's still with the Grizzlies.
The second transaction season is officially here.
Wallace then asked Parsons to train on his own, either in Memphis or Los Angeles (where his offseason home is located), and both parties believed at the time that he probably wouldn't play for the Grizzlies again.
""I am extremely disappointed that I didn't get to finish this season alongside my teammates and the Memphis coaching staff,"" Parsons told ESPN in a statement a month ago. ""Unfortunately that option wasn't presented to me.
""The Grizzlies training staff medically cleared me to play 5-on-5 in mid-December, and I have been practicing with the team ever since. I will continue to work out and train until my agent and the team reach a resolution. I am ready to play and committed to getting back on the court.""
Parsons has one season remaining on his four-year, $94.4 million maximum contract that he signed in the summer of 2016, when the Dallas Mavericks didn't attempt to re-sign him due to knee problems that required season-ending surgery the previous two seasons.
The Grizzlies had discussions before the deadline about trading Parsons in salary-dump deals but didn't find an offer they deemed worthy of accepting, sources said. They declined one offer that would have cost Memphis two future second-round picks and taking back salary for next season, a source said.
Parsons has been limited to 73 games, primarily because of knee problems, since signing with the Grizzlies. He earned a starting job in training camp this fall but played only three games before knee soreness sidelined him again. He has averaged seven points in 19.3 minutes per game for the Grizzlies.
Sources said coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who has had a close relationship with Parsons since his rookie season with the Houston Rockets, had hoped to be able to reinsert the forward into the Grizzlies' rotation and believed Memphis would benefit from his shooting before his departure.
The Grizzlies (22-34) rank last in the league in scoring (100.3 points per game) and 26th in 3-point shooting (34.0 percent).

25970005,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Dwyane Wade knows something about assembling a superteam, and the Miami Heat great believes the addition of DeMarcus Cousins makes the Golden State Warriors' All-Star starting five perhaps the best the NBA has ever seen.
""That is as good as it gets in our game with any team ever to play this game,"" Wade said. ""That is as good as it gets with a starting five. That is why they are who they are, that is why they are champions.
""To be able to add a guy like DeMarcus to it, that is what great teams do. They add a piece and keep adding certain right pieces, and they've done it.""
No matter where he spends the rest of his career, Kevin Durant is determined to set himself up for success for the rest of his life.
As they exchanged jerseys following Sunday's game at Oracle Arena, Stephen Curry made a point to ask Dwyane Wade, ""Are you sure you don't have a couple more years left in there?""
The Knicks used an image of rookie center Mitchell Robinson playing alongside Golden State's Kevin Durant in a pitch to season-ticket holders, then deleted the picture.
In his final game at Oracle Arena, Wade nearly helped the Heat stun the Warriors before his team fell 120-118. Golden State overcame a 26-7 deficit early to come back and win. Kevin Durant scored 39 points, Klay Thompson added 29 and Steph Curry 25 to help the Warriors (40-15) win for the 17th time in 19 games.
At the start of the decade, Wade helped Miami assemble its big three by teaming up with LeBron James and Chris Bosh in Miami. The power move by James -- leaving Cleveland to form a new superteam -- helped set the trend of superstars looking to join forces with other stars when they become free agents for the best opportunity to win championships.
But neither Wade nor the rest of the league has quite seen a starting five of All-Stars like the one Golden State has in Durant, Curry, Thompson, Draymond Green and Cousins.
Cousins just returned on Jan. 18 from an Achilles injury and has played in only 10 games. But his presence has been felt in the Golden State locker room and in the Western Conference standings.
Despite having arguably his worst game since his Warriors debut with seven points and three rebounds in 26 minutes on Sunday, Cousins came up big at the end with a huge offensive rebound before drawing a foul and making the game-winning free throws with 5.4 seconds left.
""He's basically single-handedly negated the dog days, he really has,"" Golden State coach Steve Kerr explained. ""These last games before the All-Star break, usually from early January on, you got a three- to four-week stretch where everybody is just trying to get to the break. We bypassed that.
""DeMarcus has come in and energized our team. ... He's just bringing this excitement and energy every game and he's getting better and better and fitting right in with the group. More than anything, he's just energized us.""
Wade, though, thinks that other teams will find a way to eventually catch up to Golden State's super five.
""People always find a way,"" Wade said. ""The superteams go back a long way, way before the Miami Heat did it. Having Hall of Famers, multiple Hall of Famers on one team. The league will continue to put the right talent around.
""If you look at what they just did in Philly, the trades they did adding those guys to that team and so on. This game will be good for a long time. With the talent that is coming in and the talent that is here now, the game is in good hands.""

25948455,"After considering the possibility of shutting down All-NBA center Anthony Davis, the New Orleans Pelicans will allow Davis back into the lineup for the rest of the season, the team confirmed in a statement Thursday night.
The two storied franchises have battled for championships through the decades. With the backdrop of a thrilling finish Thursday night, their next battle will come this summer as both teams try to land the coveted Pelicans star.
Here's what the teams still in the Anthony Davis sweepstakes can offer in the offseason.
Zach Lowe breaks down the teams and players on notice after a whirlwind trade deadline.
After the trade deadline passed with Davis on the roster Thursday, Pelicans executives and coach Alvin Gentry met to discuss the plan to reincorporate Davis into the team, league sources told ESPN. The NBA office was concerned about the possibility of a healthy star being forced to sit out in this situation, sources said.
In a statement Thursday night explaining the decision, general manager Dell Demps said, ""A number of factors contributed to this decision. Ultimately, Anthony made it clear to us that he wants to play, and he gives our team the best opportunity to win games.
""Moreover, the Pelicans want to preserve the integrity of the game and align our organization with NBA policies. We believe Anthony playing upholds the values that are in the best interest of the NBA and its fans. We look forward to seeing Anthony in a Pelicans uniform again soon.""
Davis has said he wants to return to the lineup and finish the season on the court.
Because Davis had requested a trade 11 days ago and informed the organization that he would leave in free agency in 2020, there had been consideration of sitting Davis and preserving his health as a trade asset, sources said.
Davis has missed nine games with a finger injury but was cleared to practice this week.

25912216,"SAN ANTONIO -- The dark and empty AT&T Center buzzed with animated discussion Saturday morning among the New Orleans Pelicans after their shootaround.
But instead of the obvious conversation focused on Anthony Davis, who requested a trade Monday through his agent, Rich Paul, of Klutch Sports, Jrue Holiday and a couple of Pelicans argued the virtues of various fast-food franchises with the discussion delving as deep as lighting and ambiance.
The scene only bolstered what Holiday would say seconds later.
""Nothing has really changed,"" Holiday told ESPN. ""It's just that people keep asking us the question: 'Is it weird?'""
We've got you covered on the biggest deals going down at the NBA trade deadline.
• All the trades, grades and intel
• Trade tracker: Details on every move
• Davis is still a Pelican -- now what? 
• What's next for Markelle Fultz in Orlando?
• How good are the Raptors with Gasol?
• Trade machine: You be the GM
With Davis (left index finger sprain) sitting at the end of the bench in a tan blazer and jeans, the shorthanded Pelicans hit the court for their 113-108 loss to the San Antonio Spurs also missing Nikola Mirotic (right calf strain), Julius Randle (right ankle sprain), E'Twaun Moore (bruised left quadriceps), and Elfrid Payton (right ankle sprain).
So at 23-30 staring up from near the bottom of the Western Conference standings with a slew of injuries, New Orleans insists Davis' situation isn't a distraction.
""Not really, it's just more so the media keeps asking us if it's a distraction, or asking me,"" Holiday said. ""I feel like we've had two games [coming into Saturday] where we played very, very well, and having Anthony there, he's been the ultimate professional and friend, not just to me, but everybody on the team.""
The latter certainly appeared to be the case after the team's morning shootaround, which Davis attended dressed in full practice gear. As the team boarded a charter bus to leave the arena Saturday morning, Davis could be seen joking and chatting with teammates.
Then, hours later, New Orleans would find a way to make the matchup against a surging Spurs squad interesting, despite trailing by 22 points with 5:55 left. The Pelicans embarked on a 24-5 run to chop San Antonio's lead to just three with 38 seconds left on Frank Jackson's layup.
That's as close as New Orleans would get.
""We never give up,"" Holiday said. ""I feel like people think we're shorthanded or maybe that we're going to get blown out, but we haven't had many blowouts this year, and that's because we're always going to fight until there's zero on the clock, no matter who is playing.""
LaMarcus Aldridge scores 25 and grabs 14 boards in the Spurs' 113-108 win vs. the Pelicans.
In the moments before tipoff as Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry addressed the media, Davis sat in a private space on an examination table inside the visiting locker room receiving ultrasound treatment from the medical staff on his sprained left index finger. Davis said the team would re-evaluate the injury after Saturday's game, and his intention is to suit up and play once cleared to participate.
Given his own experience last season in dealing with Kawhi Leonard's trade demands, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was asked whether he provided any advice to Gentry, whom he calls a friend.
""No, that's none of my business,"" Popovich said.
But Popovich did greet Davis at the conclusion of Saturday's game, and the two spoke briefly.
The NBA trade deadline arrives Thursday, and Davis remains under contract through 2020. So despite recent trade offers from the Los Angeles Lakers that were deemed underwhelming by the club, the Pelicans could wait until the offseason to deal Davis, when the Boston Celtics, who are also interested in trading for the five-time All-Star, would be in better position to make a stronger offer.
If Davis remains with the Pelicans beyond the trade deadline, the situation could force Gentry to make the difficult and awkward decision of whether to play Davis or bench him for the rest of the season.
Davis has missed the past seven games because of the finger injury but expects to be cleared soon to play.
Gentry was noncommittal Friday when asked whether Davis would play again for the Pels when healthy, saying, ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.""
Still, the Davis situation doesn't come without ripple effects, not just within the Pelicans' organization, but probably league wide. Sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski that as part of discussions regarding Davis around the league, teams are now contacting New Orleans about possibly moving Holiday. But the Pelicans have indicated no interest in trading him.
Beyond this season, Holiday still has three years and $77 million remaining on his contract, which runs through 2022.
Holiday signed the five-year deal worth $125 million in the summer of 2017, and said at the time that Davis' presence played ""like 90 percent"" of a role in his decision to re-sign.
Holiday didn't walk back those comments Saturday, stressing he empathized with Davis' desire to do what's in his best interests.
""One of the reasons why I came back was because of Anthony,"" Holiday told ESPN. ""But I also know that he has to do what's best for him. But that doesn't stop my mentality of going out on the court and trying to win. Every time I get on the court, I feel like I pour my heart out. I exhaust myself. And I'm always going to do that no matter who is on the court.""
With Davis out and injuries permeating the roster, several players have received increased minutes such as Jackson, who played a team-high 42 minutes and led New Orleans in scoring with a career-high 25 points. Darius Miller played 33 minutes, scoring 11 points, and Holiday contributed 15 points and four assists.
""I think what is happening is they're on the court together a lot right now because of the injuries that we have, and they're playing for each other, playing hard and competing,"" Gentry said. ""They know that this is an opportunity for them to establish themselves in the league.""
Added Popovich: ""With all the guys out for New Orleans, they've been playing well, beating Houston, [and] they had an opportunity to beat Denver the other night. They've really pulled together, played well and played hard.""
Holiday, meanwhile, entered the matchup against the Spurs averaging career highs in points (21.2) and rebounds (4.9), and his eight assists per game ties a career high.
He didn't hesitate when asked whether he was concerned how Davis' situation might affect his own future.
""Not even a little bit,"" Holiday said. ""Unless I hear something from upper management where I'm going to be traded or something like that, I plan to keep trying to win every game that I step on the court wearing a Pelicans jersey.""
"
25948425,"NEW YORK CITY, N.Y. - There his is. You can clearly see him.
Mitch Creek is not in the game, but his presence is felt. Leaping out of his seat when his teammates make a play; clapping and shouting words of encouragement when they need it.
When the Denver Nuggets' All-Star center Nikola Jokic is called for an offensive foul, Creek mimics the referee's hand signal for a charge. When D'Angelo Russell hits a three-pointer, he plays air guitar on the baseline in celebration.
Which players and picks are on the move? We have a rundown of the latest deals.
For Creek, at the time midway through his second 10-day contract after being called up from the G-League, this is just part and parcel of his life as an NBA player.
""Regardless of what my role is - tonight (Tuesday) I was just supporting the boys and riding the wave and trying to keep that up - I embrace it wholeheartedly,"" Creek says.
-------
They say you can't reach your ultimate destination without encountering a few bumps along the road while on your journey. Nothing worth having ever came easy.
By now, Creek's journey from the NBL to the NBA is well known. We also know that his path hasn't been linear; it's been littered with obstacles and adversity that he's had to overcome.
The NBA dream almost didn't materialize when his former NBL team, the Adelaide 36ers, tried to block his path to America unless they received due compensation. Luckily, logic prevailed, and Creek joined the Brooklyn Nets G-League affiliate, the Long Island Nets.
Playing under Australian national team assistant Will Weaver in Long Island, Creek put up some impressive numbers - in 27 games in the G-League, Creek is averaging 14.4 points, 5.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. Then, just as is prone to happening in the NBA, a rash of injuries to the Brooklyn Nets meant that Creek's opportunity arose - the first Long Island player this season to be called up to the NBA, and just the fourth overall. He signed a 10-day contract with the team in late January.
Creek remembers the day he got the news vividly.
""I was like [Long Island] are f--ing pulling my leg here,"" he tells ESPN. ""You just don't believe that it's true. I called my agent and tried to reiterate to him like, 'are you f--ing with me right now?' If you're lying to me I'm actually going to kill you! It took an hour before it really hit me.
""The emotions ... the time and effort, the amount of unseen hours you put in, that one phone call makes every single second, sacrifice, every missed family event, it makes it all worthwhile. The last thirteen days now has felt like eternity, but at the same time it's gone quick.""
Given the adversity he'd faced to that point, Creek would be forgiven for thinking that perhaps the NBA dream might not happen this season. He admits that some feelings of doubt had crept into his mind while in the G-League.
""You wake up every day and you're like 'Am I good enough, am I not good enough?' Then you gotta try and tell yourself that you are, and you gotta try tell yourself that your persistence and effort every single day, and perfect effort every single day and perfect intention of making yourself and the team better each day - that's a thought that goes through [your mind] every day,"" he says.
""You're always reevaluating every single situation. If you don't, you're not a perfectionist and you're not striving for perfect effort. For me, it's not about being perfect, it's about giving perfect effort. I try to do that every single day.""
Creek knew that his opportunities would be limited during his 10-day stint with Brooklyn, but he was determined to make the most of what he could. It's that mindset that has endeared him to the Nets coaching staff. After scoring his first NBA point on free-throws late in a win against the Knicks, Creek was given 19 minutes to showcase his ability in the team's next game against Boston.
He didn't disappoint, finishing with 6 points, and playing some hard-nosed defense - traits the Nets are looking for as to what they want the definition of their ball club to be.
""He adds culture to our locker room; he adds toughness, smarts,"" says Brooklyn head coach Kenny Atkinson. ""I have no qualms about putting him in there. I trust him.""
Once his initial 10-day contract was up, the team had no hesitation in offering him another deal, allowing Creek to continue the pursuit of the ultimate dream.
""I love what he represents,"" adds Atkinson. ""His performance in the G-League so far has been fantastic, and we talked about giving him a second 10-day [contract] and I was like, yes, definitely. It was so great to have him continue with us.""
______________
The Brooklyn Nets are building a new culture under New Zealand-born GM Sean Marks.
Since taking over the position in February 2016, Marks has used minimal resources to build a team for long term success. Marks has signed, and brought in overlooked, high character and high upside players, such as D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert, who are bringing some excitement back to Atlantic Avenue, and are shaping the future of the franchise. With Atkinson at the helm - one of Mark's first moves as GM - the GM is, for the lack of a better comparison, trying to emulate the highly successful San Antonio Spurs model he cut his teeth on prior to Brooklyn.
To do this, each team needs a certain type of leadership, and although Creek is an NBA rookie, on the current Nets roster, only DeMarre Carroll, Ed Davis and Jared Dudley have more experience as professional basketball players.
It's some of that knowledge that Creek has accrued in almost 10 years of professional basketball that he wants to impart to his teammates. Things like staying positive at all times, no matter the situation.
""Sometimes it's as simple as trying to keep that feeling upbeat, like, 'We're alright. They made a little run, now let's get our run,'"" he tells ESPN. ""It's identifying a situation - positive or negative - and reflecting on it quickly and thinking, okay, has someone said anything? Does something need to be said, or is this a moment where you need to leave it be? You just try and do your part here-and-there.""
Theo Pinson, one of the Nets two-way players that was also called up to Brooklyn, calls Creek ""one of the best teammates I've ever had."" The two have played with each other all season and Pinson understands how important Creek's professional basketball experience is to this young Nets squad.
""Huge,"" he tells ESPN. ""He understands the physicality of the game, he understands how to outsmart other players, and not to make anything hard on himself. When you play with guys that know how to simplify the game and not make it hard, it makes the whole game easier.
""To have this opportunity to show himself, be a part of a great organization: he's earned it. Every single day he's been a great guy in the locker room, so you can't go down to Long Island and be like, 'How's Mitch? Oh, he's an asshole.' You won't ever hear something that that.""
Creek's career-high game came against the Milwaukee Bucks at home this past Monday, and while nice, he says that wasn't validation for him that he belonged in the NBA, rather it was the faith placed in him by the Nets hierarchy in giving him another contract days earlier.
""Anytime you get an opportunity it shows and proves to you, that when a head coach of an NBA team, and the GM and owners, give you that 10-day contract and then the second one so quickly, that's validation in itself,"" he says.
Pinson tells ESPN that Creek is 100 percent deserving of being on an NBA roster.
""Definitely,"" he told ESPN. ""Everyone thinks for you to be an NBA player you gotta be a great scorer. You see dudes all the time getting paid just because they're great locker room guys; great practice guys that just go out there and play well.
""When you put Mitch in the game, or Mitch in the locker room, you know what you're gonna get from him. He's a hard working guy and he's gonna give you everything he has.""
_____________
Creek's second 10-day contract came to an abrupt end on trade deadline day. Back to Long Island and back to the grind, his NBA future uncertain. Whatever happens from here on out, the gamble Creek took on himself, the faith he had in his own ability to reach his dreams, ensures that this season will be considered a success, even if it means finishing out the rest of the 2018-19 season in the G-League.
""I'm having a blast,"" he says. ""I feel like you go out and water that garden every day - sometimes it's just dirt, and you put a bit of top soil in there and water it and one day it starts to grow. Something grew here [Brooklyn]. It's a pretty f--ing cool feeling to call yourself an NBA player and run up-and-down and play against Giannis [Antetokounmpo], play against Jaylen Brown, play against Al Horford, [Jayson] Tatum. I had a lot of people say, 'you're not good enough' and still to this day, but at the end of the day, I trusted myself and I can go home with my head held high and my hands in my pockets whistling away going 'it's a pretty f--ing sweet ride.'""

25938197,"CHICAGO -- Despite Anthony Davis being listed as questionable headed into Wednesday's matchup against the Chicago Bulls, New Orleans Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said the team plans to sit the five-time All-Star center until after Thursday's trade deadline.
Should the Pelicans wait on a trade? What happens with the Celtics will have huge influence here.
Lakers management, feeling like they are starting to bid against themselves, insist they'll add nothing more to an existing offer to the Pelicans for star Anthony Davis, sources told ESPN.
Anthony Davis is still a Pelican, but big names like Marc Gasol and Markelle Fultz are on the move. Get the latest news and analysis, including trade grades and after-the-buzzer updates.
""He is [available], but we're not going to play him until after the trading deadline,"" Gentry said. ""I think everybody can understand that.""
The NBA trade deadline expires at 3 p.m. ET Thursday.
Davis participated in Wednesday morning's shootaround at the United Center, chatting with teammates and various assistant coaches, but he will miss his ninth consecutive game since suffering a left index finger injury on Jan. 18.
The Pelicans have gone 2-6 in his absence.
Davis requested a trade through agent Rich Paul a little more than a week ago, but he isn't eligible to become a free agent until July 2020.
Davis' preferred destinations include the Los Angeles Lakers, LA Clippers and Milwaukee Bucks. He has informed the Pelicans that he wouldn't sign a five-year, $239 million supermax contract with the club this summer or next, and he has also made it known that he doesn't plan to sign an extension with any team this summer -- as the plan is to do so once he becomes a free agent.
""Obviously, it's on everyone's mind,"" Gentry said. ""But we just try to put it on the back burner and focus on the task at hand. I think everything kind of clears up [after Davis is traded], at least for a while. And you can go back to I guess whatever our new normal is going to be.
""It's just part of it. It's part of the business, and you just deal with it like you would anything else.""

25946988,"BOSTON -- Sure, the Boston Red Sox knocked out the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series in October and the New England Patriots dispatched the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl less than a week ago, but let's get real: The only ""Beat L.A."" rivalry with actual juice is Celtics vs. Lakers.
Their rich, storied histories were heightened by the gamesmanship both franchises engaged in as the NBA trade deadline approached Thursday. The Los Angeles Lakers, desperate to pair LeBron James with another superstar, worked feverishly on a package to pry away Anthony Davis, who asked for a trade out of New Orleans just 10 days ago.
When L.A. failed to beat the clock, the biggest winner was its East Coast nemesis, the Boston Celtics, who implored the Pelicans to be patient. And if they could wait, Boston could utilize its treasure trove of young players and draft picks to make its own run at the 25-year-old star come July.
Against this backdrop, the two teams squared off at a raucous TD Garden on Thursday night. Never mind this version of the purple and gold came in mired in 10th place in the Western Conference, fighting to stay above .500. Never mind it has been nine long years since the foes faced each other in the Finals.
They are forever intertwined because of Jack Kent Cooke's balloons, Boston's parquet dead spots, Kareem's skyhook, Larry's 3-point daggers, Magic's no-look passes, the bruising back-and-forth battles between Pierce and Kobe.
And now, apparently, because of Rajon Rondo's frantic buzzer-beater.
In the final seconds, Kyrie Irving drives to the hoop to put the Celtics ahead, but Rajon Rondo plays hero with a jumper to beat the buzzer.
The former Celtic -- a key cog in Boston's march to a 2008 title over the Lakers -- capped a wild evening by swishing a jumper as time expired to stun his former team.
""A storybook ending,"" LeBron declared.
It was a thrilling finish to an otherwise crushing day for Lakers fans, who hoped for Davis to don their uniform by the weekend. In one of the most active deadline days ever, a multitude of trades impacted contending teams such as Milwaukee, Toronto and Philadelphia. Yet all eyes remained fixed on two storied franchises that ultimately ... did nothing.
Here's what the teams still in the Anthony Davis sweepstakes can offer in the offseason.
Which players and picks are on the move? We have a rundown of the latest deals.
The Lakers offered any player outside of LeBron paired with draft picks, nightclub passes and ""I Love L.A."" bumper stickers, but the Pelicans stood pat. Now, it will be Boston's turn to manage the speculation that will run rampant through the season and up to the summer.
Who will be used as bait to lure Davis aboard? Will Boston pull the trigger on young stud Jayson Tatum? Will favorite son Marcus Smart be a casualty of the Davis sweepstakes? Will the Lakers reload and sweeten the pot? Will Kyrie Irving stick around to play alongside his friend Davis?
""Celtics vs. Lakers again -- let's revisit this in July,"" Lakers analyst (and NBA 1987 champion over Boston) Mychal Thompson said.
The inability to land Davis is a blow to Lakers president Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson, who, when he took over as president of basketball operations, promised the game's elite stars would flock to L.A. Magic didn't make the trip to Boston on Thursday night, though his checkered history here is all part of the lore.
It was against the Celtics in 1984 that Magic missed key free throws and was pinned with the dubious nickname ""Tragic Magic."" Johnson rebounded with clutch play in the 1985 Finals against Boston, and then, in 1987, lofted his ""junior, junior skyhook"" over the outstretched arms of Bird, McHale and Parish to drive a stake through their reign.
Magic went on to win five rings, earning the right to gloat to his old pal Larry that he and his Lakers had the upper hand.
Who has it now? As Thompson so aptly stated: check back in July.
In the meantime, an instant classic unfolded in a charged arena teeming with reminders of the past. Kurt Rambis roamed the corridor in his Lakers sweat jacket. Kevin Garnett, the architect of Boston's 2008 Big Three redux, which won Banner 17 over -- who else? -- Kobe and the Lakers, sat courtside wearing Celtics green with Rondo emblazoned on the back. Sitting right next to him was Lakers alum Metta World Peace, who punctured KG and Paul Pierce's dream of a second title with a seminal Game 7 performance at the Garden in the 2010 Finals.
All of this pomp and circumstance (along with the entertaining sidelight of LeBron vs. Kyrie) generated a frenzied playoff atmosphere.
""Anytime these two teams play,"" Celtics guard Terry Rozier said, ""you better take it seriously. Because all the people who came before and played in this game did.""
Emotions always run high when L.A. and Boston play each other, but the hype was cranked up by LeBron's Boston debut as a Laker. He dropped a triple-double on his old Cleveland teammate and the boys in green, and sprayed pinpoint passes to the youngster Kyle Kuzma.
Irving, meanwhile, struggled through three quarters, shooting just 3-of-18 from the field.
It was a rare poor shooting performance for the point guard, who is in the midst of a career season. Irving has always been a scorer, but his willingness to play facilitator this season has been noteworthy. His attention to the defensive end has, as of Monday, enabled Irving to post better defensive real plus-minus stats than Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday and Patrick Beverley.
He is serenaded regularly with ""MVP"" chants from local fans, yet Irving stunned them all last week by backing off from his commitment to unequivocally re-sign with Boston when free agency commences in July. Team sources insist that Irving has told them that the Celtics remain the front-runner. But what precipitated the wavering of the commitment?
Kyrie isn't really saying.
""Honestly, I'm not completely sure. But it's hard when people come out with all these rumors about you, saying all these things that you can't really control,"" Boston forward Marcus Morris told ESPN. ""A player of [Kyrie's] caliber doesn't want to really hear it. Nobody wants stuff put out there that's completely made up. It's frustrating.
""I understand where he's coming from. He wants his freedom. He has the right to dictate his future. I agree with him 100 percent.""
Irving was asked by ESPN what he made of the fact that neither the Lakers nor the Celtics made a significant transaction at the deadline, yet continued to dominate the narrative because of their pursuit of Davis.
""It's the nature of the business,"" Irving shrugged. ""It's been like this for a while.""
Added Morris: ""The NBA is weird sometimes. We all need stories. So why not Anthony Davis?""
For now, the teams in pursuit of Davis will go their separate ways as the Lakers try to build on this rousing victory and the Celtics retreat to the film room to dissect how they let yet another game slip away.
Beat L.A.? Not in this game, not on this night.
And yet, you got the feeling the Celtics walked away winners of something far more significant.

25945433,"The Associated Press, citing a source, said an NBA trade call was needed to complete the deal prior to the 3 p.m. ET trade deadline.
Who wins this deal? Kevin Pelton grades the move.
After a flurry of trades, which teams are looking worse and which ones got stronger?
The Rockets are acquiring guard Iman Shumpert, whom they expect to play a significant bench role in their playoff push, in a three-way deal with the Cavaliers and Kings.
Philadelphia will become the sixth club for the well-traveled Ennis, who averaged 7.4 points for the Rockets this season.
Ennis has also played for Miami, New Orleans, Memphis and Detroit. He's a career 36 percent shooter from 3-point range and will add to Philadelphia's bench depth.
The Rockets, who will create a $1.6 million trade exception with the deal, are inching their way closer to getting under the luxury tax. The Rockets save $2.4 million with the trade and are now $2.4 million above the tax threshold.
Houston started the season with a tax bill of $14.6 million.

25992666,"For Joel Embiid, it was simply the type of play he is always going to try to make. For award-winning actress Regina King, it was a moment she won't soon forget.
King was sitting in the front row at Madison Square Garden when the 7-foot Philadelphia 76ers center came charging her way in pursuit of a loose ball during the third quarter of the Sixers' 126-111 win over the New York Knicks.
Embiid leaped into the stands, clearing King, but crashed feetfirst into the MSG Network statistician working next to broadcaster Mike Breen.
""It's good that I saved her life, I guess, but someone else had to, like, take that,"" Embiid said, referring to the statistician. ""I'm sorry about that.""
King, perhaps best known to sports fans as Rod Tidwell's wife in the movie ""Jerry Maguire,"" won a Golden Globe last month for her role in ""If Beale Street Could Talk,"" and she is nominated for an Academy Award for the same role. She expressed her gratefulness for emerging unscathed in a tweet.
Yoooo. Thank you God and @JoelEmbiid for your athletic abilities.  Crisis averted 🙏🏾 https://t.co/LLTtzECuV4
Asked why he didn't pull up with the Sixers holding a 15-point lead at the time, Embiid said that simply isn't his nature.
""I only know one way to play and that's to play hard and compete,"" said Embiid, who added that he will do the same thing 100 percent of the time -- even if 76ers coach Brett Brown wishes he would approach things differently.
Asked for his thoughts on the play, Brown was succinct.
""Just like I think our owners and our fans back home were thinking,"" the coach said. ""You respect his aggression and his passion, but you don't want that. I say that out of love and care. It's stuff you hope to avoid.""
The statistician somehow stayed in the game.
""I didn't see him, but I know he's going to feel it tomorrow,'' said 76ers teammate Ben Simmons.
Embiid said of his impromptu leap, ""I haven't done that since my rookie season -- and it just happened.""

25963405,"HOUSTON -- The first screen came, and like a waiter weaving through a crowded restaurant, Paul George thinly slid in front of it, keeping James Harden checked. It was narrative perfection, two MVP candidates squaring off with the game on the line, both with 40-point games running, a single stop or shot about to decide it.
""Absolutely I wanted that matchup,"" George said. ""I wanted that matchup the whole night.""
Eric Gordon re-screened right after, though, and George, fighting to crawl over it, got caught just enough to force the switch.
James Harden scored at least 30 points for the 29th game in a row, and Russell Westbrook had a triple-double in his ninth straight game -- and got the win.
The second transaction season is officially here.
Ten seconds remained, and the Oklahoma City Thunder led by a point as Harden sized up his new matchup, Russell Westbrook. It felt obvious what was coming; it was just a matter of if the step-back shot would go in or not. Westbrook got a quality contest, Harden landed awkwardly and the shot hit back iron. George skied for the rebound, was fouled and hit two free throws. A Houston Rockets turnover with 3.4 seconds left sealed it. The Thunder, coming back from 26 points down, stunned Houston 117-112.
George accomplished the rare feat of outscoring Harden -- 45 to 42 -- and did it on an efficient 12-of-22 shooting, including 6-of-14 from 3. He also spent the majority of the game guarding Harden, one of the toughest tasks in the NBA.
""I look forward to playing against the best, and I look forward to being guarded by the best,"" George said. ""I have fun with the game. That's what the game is about.""
George clearly relishes the showdowns, especially against his potential MVP peers. He outplayed Giannis Antetokounmpo two weeks ago, punctuating the performance with a dunk over the Greek Freak, and sparked the Thunder in the second half on Saturday. And while it's subtle, he takes pride in the fact that, at least for him, it's a two-way matchup.
""Back in the day, that's how they went at it,"" George said. ""That's how I was taught the game -- enjoy matchups, have fun with it.""
The Thunder have won 10 of 11, the blemish a five-point road loss against the Boston Celtics on Super Bowl Sunday. The run has come in the wake of losing five of six, with George turning it around with a four-point game winner against the Philadelphia 76ers on Jan. 19. They've established an identity as a swarming defensive team that plays fast and in transition, with Westbrook's hellish paint attacks setting the table for George's patient scoring. Westbrook has willingly and openly ceded the floor to George, finding a way to mesh their contrasting styles and personalities.
Terrance Ferguson sends the ball up, and Nerlens Noel puts down the alley-oop jam.
But what's elevating the Thunder is their complementary parts, such as Dennis Schroder who had 17 points (13 in the third quarter) and Terrance Ferguson (15 points, 3 of 5 from 3). Steven Adams is at the concrete wall in the middle, setting Richter scale registering screens and anchoring them defensively. Jerami Grant has blossomed as a Swiss Army stretch 4, hitting 3s and protecting the rim. It's a balanced roster, the most blended the Thunder have had since Kevin Durant was part of it.
Earlier in the day, though, the Thunder announced they had waived guard Alex Abrines, bringing the roster down to 12 players, after trading Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot last week. It's actually 11, though, as starter Andre Roberson is still not cleared to play since injuring his knee last season. They're simultaneously deep and extremely thin, with a high-quality, second-unit player such as Schroder but limited inexperienced options deeper on the bench.
The development of Ferguson has been game-changing for OKC; a true 3-and-D wing who can play in any lineup for extended minutes. Abdel Nader, a player picked up last summer as a castoff by the Celtics, has added critical minutes as a floor spacer in spot minutes. And Deonte Burton, a two-way player who is a candidate to officially join the roster should the Thunder convert his contract in the next couple of weeks, played 10 important minutes on Saturday against the Rockets. Burton was a game-high plus-18 despite not scoring.
By rule, the Thunder have two weeks to bring the roster back up to 14 players. The Thunder have a few options with the remaining three roster spots. Converting Burton is one, but the likely scenario is to fill the gaps with a couple of 10-day contracts to buy time and wait out the buyout market to see who comes available. As long as a player is waived by March 1, they're eligible for a postseason roster.
It has put added responsibility on Westbrook and George, both on the floor and off, to lead the Thunder. On Saturday, as they melted down in a dismal first half, Westbrook was active in huddles, pulling aside his young teammates to tell them to stop thinking and to trust their games and play ball. Leadership is something Westbrook had to learn and evolve in, but it's a skill that has become critical to the development of the Thunder.
""There is no particular way; leadership is not all about basketball, it's not all about what the cameras see,"" Westbrook said. ""Me, personally, I lead a lot, just not on camera. Going to guys' houses, having dinner, sitting down, learn a little about themselves. Make sure guys are confident and comfortable with what they're doing, so I take huge, huge pride in being the leader and understanding my teammates in this locker room.""
Russell Westbrook and Paul George agree that Westbrook brings more to the table, especially on nights shots aren't falling for him.
On Saturday, except for the trailing by 26 part, it all kind of went according to plan for the Thunder. George was spectacular, Westbrook was a triple-doubling wrecking ball of both very good and very bad, with slightly more good, and the secondary pieces produced. It was a big win for OKC, but not one they overly celebrated. The locker room was steady and calm, with a few random shouts from Westbrook from the showers. There's a belief growing and a standard of performance expected.
""We need these. We need moments like these,"" George said. ""We need gut-check moments just to find out what this team is about.""

25927397,"The New Orleans Pelicans are engaging with the Los Angeles Lakers in talks on a trade for All-NBA star Anthony Davis, but president Magic Johnson must overcome a significant desire within the Pelicans organization to let Thursday's deadline expire with Davis remaining on the roster, league sources told ESPN.
Set against the 3 p.m. ET Thursday trade deadline, this process has transformed into a high-stakes game of leverages, postures and bluffs among several organizations and Davis' agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports. So far, the Lakers have felt that conversations with New Orleans have been one-sided, and they are growing increasingly pessimistic about the Pelicans' willingness to make a deal with them, sources with knowledge of the discussions told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne.
The Pelicans haven't countered the Lakers' offers but do have expectations that Johnson will overwhelm them with young players and a historic haul of draft picks. To New Orleans, that means four first-round and second-round picks as part of a trade package, league sources told ESPN. The Pelicans want to be compensated -- perhaps even overcompensated -- for bypassing the chance to open up the process in the offseason and delivering Davis to the Lakers now.
The Lakers are currently offering the Pelicans a package that includes forwards Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma, guard Lonzo Ball and two first-round picks, as well as a willingness to absorb the remaining $12.7 million on Solomon Hill's contract in the 2019-20 season, league sources told ESPN.
Anthony Davis Sr., speaking only for himself and not the Pelicans star, told ESPN on Friday that he would not want his son to play for the Celtics, citing the lack of loyalty the organization showed Isaiah Thomas.
The New Orleans Pelicans have lost two of three games since Anthony Davis requested a trade. But Jrue Holiday says the team keeps playing.
Our experts pitch their best deals, featuring multiple first-round picks and young players with star potential.
Johnson delivered the offers in multiple phone conversations with New Orleans general manager Dell Demps on Monday, sources said. If nothing else, the Lakers have embarked on a more ambitious bid for Davis, 25, than they made for Paul George or Kawhi Leonard in recent seasons after those players asked for trades with full years left on their contracts. The Lakers are fighting both the clock on Thursday's trade deadline and the Pelicans' ability to hold onto Davis into the offseason, when there could be several new scenarios available to them.
Paul seems to have made some inroads into tightening the trade market on the Pelicans, limiting what some rivals might be willing to offer based on the fear of losing Davis as a rental in 2020 free agency. Paul has worked to keep the process moving toward a perception of inevitability on Davis' preferred future destination, the Lakers, where he could join another Klutch client, LeBron James.
The Pelicans did learn Monday of a new, extended list of teams that Davis is willing to stay with long term upon being traded, including the Milwaukee Bucks and LA Clippers, league sources said. Those teams have yet to make offers for Davis and likely don't have the assets to make a deal happen, league sources said.
Paul is providing the Pelicans with clear options beyond the Lakers, but questions are being asked about those teams' ability to make compelling offers to the Pelicans. The New York Knicks were on that extended list, but they were rejected in their offer of a package centered on Kristaps Porzingis prior to his trade to Dallas, league sources said.
New York has not re-engaged with New Orleans on Davis since the Porzingis trade on Tuesday, sources said. Absent from the new list are the Boston Celtics, league sources said. The Celtics are unable to trade for Davis until July 1 as long as Kyrie Irving is on the team's roster, based on the fact that they both are under the provision of the designated rookie extension.
Nevertheless, the Celtics remain determined to acquire Davis after the season, and Celtics GM Danny Ainge has directly urged Demps to wait until the offseason, when the Celtics have promised to be aggressive with their wealth of draft and player assets to try to acquire Davis, league sources said. Ainge is eager to trade for Davis and pair him with Irving, sources said.
Boston's plan to pursue Davis remains unaffected by whatever decision Irving might make in summer free agency, league sources said. Irving, 26, previously said he planned to re-sign with the Celtics in the summer but has recently wavered in public on that promise. Although the Celtics can't be sure about Irving's forthcoming decision in July, they remain confident that he'll choose to stay in Boston, sources said. The Celtics also believe that a deal for Davis will help solidify his confidence in re-signing with the organization, sources said.
Still, Davis' camp has been engaged in an aggressive campaign to push back on the possibility of the All-Star center's future in Boston, encouraging the Pelicans to do a deal with the Lakers or another preferred team prior to Boston's chance to become active in deal talks in the offseason. The best chance Davis has to force his way to the Lakers is creating a level of chaos and uncertainty in the marketplace about his privately stated wishes. The league's landscape is certainly feeling the tremors of the campaign by Paul and Davis.
For now, the Lakers' pursuit has several factors working against it. As the Lakers elevate their offer, including more top young players and even more draft picks, they'll keep closing the gap. Until then, New Orleans is curious about whether the Celtics might include young star Jayson Tatum in an offseason trade along with a package of first-round picks, sources said.
The Celtics could have access to four first-round picks in the June draft. New Orleans is determined that any deal for Davis will include a young player returning to them who has the potential to become an All-NBA performer -- a first-, second- or third-team player, sources said. The Pelicans could wait until the draft lottery in May, when they'll have a better idea of when and how Boston's protected picks in deals with Philadelphia, Memphis and the Clippers could be conveyed in a deal.
Also, the Pelicans could risk improving their draft status and costing themselves the ability to get a higher pick in the draft by bringing back the core of young Lakers players. There's a real possibility that the Pelicans and Davis could agree on a limited playing schedule post-trade deadline, but that's undetermined.
What's more, there's a small possibility that the Knicks could win the draft lottery and become viable candidates for a trade. There are also always three- and four-team trade scenarios that could open up new player and draft-pick possibilities to the Pelicans in the offseason. The Pelicans believe that the Lakers' bid at the trade deadline will still be available to them in the offseason, sources said. Several rival GMs believe that New Orleans could use the Lakers' final offer at the deadline as the baseline for offers in the offseason.
Davis, who requested a trade a week ago through Paul, can't become a free agent until July 2020. He has no plans to sign an extension with any team this summer, expecting to do so when he becomes a free agent. Davis informed the Pelicans that he wouldn't sign a five-year, $239 million supermax contract this summer or next.

25994987,"NBA commissioner Adam Silver says he hasn't ""given any thought"" to inquiries by NFL owners about his willingness to switch leagues and become commissioner of the NFL.
While Silver did not explicitly confirm that he had been approached by NFL owners, sources close to the situation told ESPN that several NFL owners have tried to persuade Silver to run their league over the course of his five years as the NBA's commissioner. Silver has also been approached by a number of Fortune 500 companies, according to sources.
""I'll just say I have not given it any thought,"" Silver told ESPN about his reaction to those job opportunities. ""I feel very fortunate to be in this position. As a longtime fan, as a longtime league employee, the opportunity to become the commissioner of this league was beyond anything I even ever dreamed of as a kid.
""I've loved every day I've been in this job, and I think there's nothing but enormous opportunity ahead for this league. And ultimately, I realize I'm just passing through like every player who's gone through this league and ultimately like every owner, and I feel an enormous obligation to the fans and to this greater NBA family to do my best and try my hardest every day. But that's where 100 percent of my focus is.""
ESPN's Don Van Natta and Seth Wickersham reported in August 2017 that a confidant of an NFL owner reached out to gauge whether Silver would be interested in running the NFL, to which Silver immediately said no.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell signed a five-year extension worth up to $200 million in December 2017. Silver signed a five-year extension with the NBA in June that runs through the 2023-24 season.
Silver is celebrating his five-year anniversary as NBA commissioner this weekend at the All-Star Game in Charlotte, North Carolina. He officially succeeded David Stern as the league's fifth commissioner on Feb. 1, 2014, and held his first State of the NBA news conference on Feb. 15 of that year at the All-Star Game in New Orleans.
League revenues have increased from $4.8 billion to a projected $9.1 billion in Silver's five years. Team valuations have increased by 267 percent, from an average of $509 million in 2013 to $1.9 billion in the latest Forbes Magazine valuations.
The NBA has been a vanguard in embracing esports, legalized sports betting, allowing patch advertisements on jerseys, reform of the draft lottery and rules changes to improve game flow and referee accountability.

25952164,"As far as Danny Ainge is concerned, the invitations can be sent out because the wedding is still on.
The Boston Celtics president of basketball operations said on Friday that the team's ""engagement"" to star guard Kyrie Irving remains intact, and the couple plans to make it official on July 1, when teams can sign free agents.
""The way I viewed the situation is that I think a lot of people, because of Kyrie's announcement at the beginning of the year, thought that it was a marriage,"" Ainge said on Boston sports radio 98.5 The Sports Hub. ""And I think that it's more like an engagement. And we're going to get married on July 1st. I think that engagement is still on, as far as I know.
""In my individual conversations with Kyrie, we're still engaged but we really can't make those vows, sign that contract until July 1st.""
Kyrie Irving insists his focus is on winning a championship with the Celtics this season and not on his future. As for re-signing with Boston, he said: ""Ask me July 1.""
Zach Lowe breaks down the teams and players on notice after a whirlwind trade deadline.
The two storied franchises have battled for championships through the decades. With the backdrop of a thrilling finish Thursday night, their next battle will come this summer as both teams try to land the coveted Pelicans star.
Last week, Irving, who can opt out of the final year of his contract and test free agency this summer, didn't seem as committed to a long-term relationship as he had prior to the start of the season, though he did say that the Celtics remain ""at the head of the race"" regarding free agency.
""At the end of the day, I'm going to do what's best for my career, and that's just where it stands. That's just where it stands,"" Irving said Feb. 1. ""... Ask me July 1st.""
Also remaining to be seen is whether New Orleans Pelicans big man Anthony Davis will join the procession. The Celtics' hopes of landing the star -- possibly by including Jayson Tatum in an offer after the season -- were buoyed when Davis, a friend of Irving, stayed put at the trade deadline.
League sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski that the Celtics have promised to be aggressive with their wealth of draft and player assets to try to acquire Davis, and that Ainge is eager to pair Davis with Irving. Sources also said the Celtics believe that a deal for Davis will help solidify Irving's confidence in re-signing with the organization.
Due to an NBA rule, the Celtics are not allowed to trade for Davis until Irving becomes a free agent.
Davis, however, didn't include the Celtics this week on his list of teams he would stay with long term upon a trade, league sources told Wojnarowski. And Davis' father told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne last week that he wouldn't want his son to play in Boston, though he wasn't speaking on behalf of Davis either.
In October, Irving essentially committed to staying with the Celtics long term in front of thousands of fans at a team event. However, last week, he chalked that statement up to ""excitement"" and ""feeling emotionally invested"" at that time.
Since then, Irving has expressed frustration with Boston's inconsistent play at different points throughout the season. However, he remains confident the group can find consistency and play to its potential.
The Celtics (35-20) are in fourth place in the Eastern Conference standings entering Friday's games.

25960811,"PHILADELPHIA -- LeBron James knows that his All-Star draft was perceived as a preemptive recruiting measure for all the players with flexible contract situations whom he targeted, but he said that the motivation behind his picks was simply fielding the best team possible.
""I think that's a great conversation,"" the Los Angeles Lakers superstar said after practice Saturday, a couple days removed from Thursday's draft. ""Everyone kind of gets up for fantasy basketball talk. Guys that are restricted free agents, that are free agents, I don't know, [guys that have] player options. That's all part of the speculation that continues to drive our sport.""
James selected Kevin Durant, who is expected to test free agency this summer, with the No. 1 overall pick.
James then added former teammate Kyrie Irving -- who is also expected to decline his player option for 2019-20 with the Boston Celtics and sign a long-term contract to either stay or go -- as well as Kawhi Leonard and Klay Thompson, two more players expected to draw a lot of interest on the open market this summer.
Warriors star Kevin Durant wasn't surprised to be LeBron James' first pick in the All-Star draft for a second straight year, asking reporters the rhetorical question, ""What else is he supposed to do?""
Magic Johnson plans to hug it out with the Los Angeles Lakers to help them cope with the fallout from the NBA trade deadline, saying ""it's part of the business.""
The second transaction season is officially here.
""It's all good and well and dandy, but for me, I picked according to my draft board, and I picked according to who was the best available,"" James said. ""It just so happened that I had KD, who's a pending free agent, and Kyrie, who's a pending free agent. James [Harden] is under contract until 2030. Kawhi's a free agent.""
The NBA changed to a draft format for the All-Star Game last year. Under the new parameters, the top vote-getter in each conference is named a captain, and they take turns picking their teams, choosing from a starters pool first and then reserves.
James has been named a captain both years -- last year as the leading vote-getter in the Eastern Conference and this year supplanting Stephen Curry atop the West. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was named the captain of the East for the Feb. 17 game in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""It was fun,"" James said. ""It was fun. But look forward to seeing someone else do it next year. No, I had fun. Me, Giannis and obviously the crew from TNT. I hope the fans got something out of it as well watching it.""
More fans certainly tuned in, as TNT reported a 60 percent gain in viewership for the televised draft versus last year's show, when James' and Curry's teams were simply released after the draft had already occurred off camera.
James veered from his intended draft order a couple times, he said, when Antetokounmpo threw him for a loop.
""There was a couple shuffles,"" James said. ""I knew where I was going with my first and my second pick because he had already stated he was going with Steph. So I knew I was going KD and Ky. So I kind of got shuffled a little bit when he picked [Joel] Embiid and had to kind of change my thing around. I like my team.""

James put the finishing touches on his squad by executing the first trade in All-Star draft history, swapping Russell Westbrook to Team Giannis in exchange for Ben Simmons.
His reasoning?
""I know how great friends Russ and Embiid is,"" James said, sarcastically, referencing the ongoing beef between the two superstars. Another obvious reason he did not mention is his close personal relationship with Simmons; they share an agent in Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.
James' team also features New Orleans Pelicans big man Anthony Davis -- another Klutch client. James' Lakers furiously tried to trade for Davis leading up to Thursday's deadline, winding up unsuccessful in their pursuit.
""He's under contract,"" James said, stating a fact that's left the Lakers wondering if they'll have to wait until the summer of 2020 to add Davis as a free agent if they cannot strike a deal for him this summer.
James also listed the other players he selected who are locked up with their current teams. Had he wanted to go all-in on free agents, he could have tried to add Orlando's Nikola Vucevic and Milwaukee's Khris Middleton before Antetokounmpo did.
""Bradley Beal's under contract,"" James said. ""Karl-Anthony Towns is under contract. Klay is a free agent. Who else is on my team? LaMarcus [Aldridge] is under contract. Dwyane [Wade] is jobless. And I'm under contract.""
Wade and Dirk Nowitzki were special team roster additions by NBA commissioner Adam Silver.
""Probably my worst All-Star Game by far playing with that guy,"" James said of the retiring Wade, tongue in cheek. ""I can't believe I'm sharing another All-Star Game with Dwyane Wade, my least favorite person in the world. Nah, it's going to be special, that's for sure, man. It's his last hoorah and to be part of All-Star Weekend is going to be a treat.""
