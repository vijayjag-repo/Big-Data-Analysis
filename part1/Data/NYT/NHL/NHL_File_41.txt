The left wing scored 17 goals with 65 assists. Canada's TSN reported that Gusev's representatives were working on a release from his current contract, which officially expires at the end of April."I don't know much about him," Vegas head coach Gerard Gallant said, according to the league website. "(Golden Knights general manager) George (McPhee) mentioned it today. ... If he joins us, we'll see what's going to happen. Hopefully he does join us and gets some practice time in with us, but I have no idea where that's going."Vegas trails its best-of-7 Western Conference playoff matchup with San Jose 1-0, with Game 2 set for Friday in the Bay Area. The Golden Knights are the defending Western Conference champions.Gusev was a seventh-round draft pick by the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2012, but his rights were traded to Vegas in the 2017 expansion draft.-Field Level MediaAdvertisement
