However, as NHL.com pointed out, "The department of player safety retains the right to make adjustments to the infraction upon review."Kucherov, 25, led all players this season with 128 points (41 goals, 87 assists) and is considered the favorite to win the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the NHL's Most Valuable Player.The Lightning tied an NHL record with 62 regular-season wins, and they finished with 30 more points than Columbus, the Eastern Conference's second wild card. While the 62 wins and 128 points had people talking about the Lightning as one of the great all-time regular-season teams, the start to Tampa Bay's postseason has been nothing short of mind-boggling.After blowing a three-goal lead and losing Game 1 at home 4-3 on Wednesday, the Lightning came out on their heels Friday. The Blue Jackets led 3-0 after two periods and cruised from there. Game 3 is scheduled for Sunday in Columbus, Ohio.Kucherov did not score a point in the series' first two games.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
