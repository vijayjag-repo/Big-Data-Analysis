The franchise also picked first in 1979, as the Colorado Rockies, when the initial selection was Rob Ramage, and in 2017, when the choice was Nico Hischier.The New York Rangers drew the second pick in this year's draft, followed by the Chicago Blackhawks.The Rangers were most likely to pick No. 6 before the lottery, which turned in their favor. The same could be said for the Blackhawks, who were in the No. 12 spot before their improbable jump into the top three picks of the lottery.The third pick has altered the course of the Blackhawks in the past as they have selected players such as Jonathan Toews (2006), Ed Olczyk (1984) and Denis Savard (1980) at that spot.The draft will take place June 21-22 at Rogers Arena in Vancouver. The NHL Combine is slated for May 27-June 1 in Buffalo.The order of selection for the first 15 picks:1. New Jersey Devils2. New York Rangers3. Chicago Blackhawks4.
