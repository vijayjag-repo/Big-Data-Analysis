AdvertisementSupported byBy Billy WitzLeaning over the railing from his perch on the top step of the first-base dugout this past weekend in Cleveland, Yankees Manager Joe Girardi did not have to divert his gaze to catch glimpses of the out-of-town scoreboard.It was all there on the left-field wall.“You’re going to look — it’s impossible not to,” Girardi said. “I haven’t seen a ballpark where they put it behind you. You pay attention, of course.”Whenever Girardi stole a glance, there was rarely any good news for the Yankees. While Girardi’s charges were clawing their way to a split of their four-game series against the formidable Indians, the Boston Red Sox were plowing past the rebuilding Chicago White Sox, sweeping four games at Fenway Park.Soon enough, though, there will be no need to check for updates.The Yankees, who trail the Red Sox by three games in the American League East, will have their rivals right in front of them on three of the next four weekends, beginning Friday night at Yankee Stadium.The historic rivals, both with 2017 championship ambitions, will meet 10 times in 23 days, giving the games the feel of a limited-engagement Broadway show — with almost all of it played out on a national stage. As of now, two of the games will be broadcast on ESPN, one on Fox, another on TBS and five on MLB Network. In all, nine of the 10 games will be shown to a national audience.In that way, it will be almost like old times, with some of 2017’s compelling story lines — the Los Angeles Dodgers’ torrid pace, the Chicago Cubs’ up-and-down season — being pushed to the side while the Yankees and the Red Sox go at it, and go at it some more.Ever since the teams took turns winning the American League Championship Series in 2003 and 2004 in gripping fashion, Yankees-Red Sox has generally been catnip to television networks — even as the rivalry has lost a little bit of its luster.The two teams have not reached the playoffs in the same season since 2009 and have not met this late in the season when they were in first and second place in the division since 2011.In addition, outsize players from both teams have departed, with the retirements of Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz last season in effect representing the end of an era. In fact, not since 2013, when Boston’s Ryan Dempster plunked Rodriguez — who was then appealing his suspension for the use of performance-enhancing drugs — has there been anything resembling the Yankees-Red Sox tension from the previous decade.At the moment, the real drama with both clubs seems to be internal. The Yankees benched their talented young catcher, Gary Sanchez, on Sunday because Girardi was displeased with his defensive habits behind the plate.And a story line that will not go away for the Red Sox is pitcher David Price’s antagonistic behavior toward members of the media.First, Price lashed out at a reporter covering the team, and weeks later he harangued the color analyst and former pitcher Dennis Eckersley on the team plane for what he viewed as comments critical of a teammate.Meanwhile, new characters have been introduced into the rivalry. Aaron Judge has already made his presence felt this season, be it tumbling into the Fenway Park stands to make a catch or having Jackie Bradley Jr. leap at the wall at Fenway to steal a home run from him. And the Red Sox recently tweaked their rotation to ensure that Chris Sale, in his first season in Boston, will get to face the Yankees, a team he has long dominated, in each of the three weekend series.In addition, since the two teams last met, in a series right after the All-Star break, both have made significant roster moves. While the Yankees acquired pitcher Sonny Gray and third baseman Todd Frazier and reacquired David Robertson, the Red Sox have been sparked by the recent additions of the former Yankee Eduardo Nunez and the 20-year-old prospect Rafael Devers.There is a bit of business that both teams will have to attend to in the coming days before they begin nearly a month of squaring off. The Yankees will play three games in Toronto against the last-place Blue Jays, who were particularly harsh on them the past two seasons, and the Red Sox will play two road games against the Tampa Bay Rays, who lurk in third place in the A.L. East, just two and a half games behind the Yankees.After those games, the bit players will leave the stage, and it will be time for the Yankees and the Red Sox, first in the Bronx, then a week later at Fenway, and then, two weeks later, back in the Bronx again on Labor Day weekend.Once that third series is complete, the two teams will go their separate ways, at least until October, and Girardi will assume his familiar stance, standing at the dugout’s edge with his eyes on the action but still sneaking a peek at the scoreboard.Advertisement
