The team has dedicated its championship bid to John Calabrese, the father of the first baseman, John Calabrese Jr., and brother of the manager, Joe Calabrese. John Calabrese, a 45-year-old financial analyst and sports fan, died in November 2014.Mid-Island stormed through its regular-season schedule, racking up 15 wins without any losses en route to the Little League World Series. It outscored its opponents by 158-20 in that stretch. In the first round, it beat Grandview Little League of Des Moines, Iowa.On Sunday, hundreds of Staten Islanders traveled to South Williamsport, Pa., to be among the estimated 19,000 attendees at the game. Those who could not make the trip gathered at O’Neill’s Irish Pub on Staten Island to watch.“Everybody was really into the game, watching closely and cheering after every play,” said Sydney Callahan, an employee. “It was really exciting.”The score remained close throughout as both starting pitchers racked up strikeouts. But Mid-Island broke through with a key hit from the last batter in its lineup, Robert Cavalieri, who hit a single into center field to start the third-inning rally.“The bottom of our lineup has come through for us numerous times,” the team’s manager told journalists after the game. “That hit ignited us because he did it against a kid who was bringing it.”After the game, Mid-Island’s players got a chance to meet major leaguers on the Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies, who were there to play a special “MLB Little League Classic” on Sunday night.Mid-Island’s next game will be Wednesday night against Honolulu on ESPN.Advertisement
