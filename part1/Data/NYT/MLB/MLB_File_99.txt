The strategy has worked, and it led to the highest Game 1 viewership of the World Series since 2009, when the Yankees faced the Philadelphia Phillies.The Indians’ 6-0 victory over the Cubs on Tuesday was seen on Fox by an average of 19.4 million viewers, up 30 percent from Game 1 of the Mets-Kansas City Royals series last year.Through the postseason, Cubs games have drawn the most viewers. Their National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers on FS1 averaged nearly 7 million viewers, more than doubling the 3.3 million figure for the Cleveland Indians’ series against the Toronto Blue Jays on TBS. The audience in the Toronto market is excluded from the calculation because it is not measured by Nielsen.The Cubs’ win over the San Francisco Giants had the most viewers of the four division series, finishing with an average of 5.2 million for games on FS1 and the MLB Network, compared with 3.9 million for the Indians-Boston Red Sox games on TBS; 2.4 million for the Dodgers-Washington Nationals series on FS1 and MLBN; and 1.8 million for the Blue Jays-Texas Rangers series on TBS.With the elevated attention to the World Series and the move to a larger potential audience on Fox, the Game 1 audience represented a near-doubling of the 9.7 million who watched the Cubs clinch the pennant in Game 6 of the N.L.C.S. against the Dodgers.Advertisement
