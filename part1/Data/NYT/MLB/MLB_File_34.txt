The players could have brought their families in-season and returned to Cuba in the offseason. Current Cuban major-leaguers who came to the U.S. include Jose Abreu, Aroldis Chapman and Yasiel Puig.The agreement originally was brokered to allow Cubans to play in the United States without defecting and giving up their citizenship. Players could keep 100 percent of a signing bonus, with the MLB paying 25 percent of that amount to the Cuban Baseball Federation as a release fee.--Chicago Cubs left-hander Jon Lester left his start in the top of the third inning due to left hamstring tightness, the team announced.Lester apparently sustained the injury while running the bases in the bottom of the second inning of Chicago's home opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
