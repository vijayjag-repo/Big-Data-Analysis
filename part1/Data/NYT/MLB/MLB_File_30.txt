Los Angeles blew a 6-0 first-inning lead and then lost Mike Trout for the game after the third inning because of a strained right groin. The two-time American League MVP is day-to-day.The Brewers, thanks in large part to two homers by Yasmani Grandal, rallied to take an 8-7 lead in the fifth before the Angels' bullpen got stingy and the offense rallied to put Los Angeles in position to sweep the series Wednesday.Diamondbacks 5, Rangers 4Pinch hitter Jarrod Dyson hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning as Arizona walked off with a victory over Texas in Phoenix.With one out, Dyson pulled a 2-2 off-speed pitch from closer Jose Leclerc (1-1) over the fence in right field.Arizona's Christian Walker singled to left to lead off the ninth against Leclerc and scored to make it 4-3 when Eduardo Escobar followed with a double to the wall in right-center field.

After the game, Bregman said he hopes to miss only the Wednesday game.Reds 14, Marlins 0Starter Luis Castillo fired seven scoreless innings, the heart of the order hit three consecutive homers in a seven-run sixth inning, and host Cincinnati won for the first time since Opening Day by clobbering Miami.
