Texas Tech got the ball back with its fourth steal of the game on Michigan State's next possession, and Culver hit an uncontested trey from the top of the key, putting the Red Raiders up 58-51.Senior Norense Odiase made two free throws to seal it with 39.7 seconds left after the Spartans' Kenny Goins clanked a 3-point try.The Spartans stayed in the game at the free-throw line. Sophomore Xavier Tillman rattled in two after Winston connected on four consecutive shots from the stripe, and Michigan State whittled a 12-point deficit to five (52-47) with 5:38 remaining.The Spartans cut it to three with just over three minutes to play on freshman Aaron Henry's two makes, then made it 52-51 when Henry's slashing layup went in with 2:44 left.Texas Tech roared out of the halftime locker room with buckets on four of five possessions and took an eight-point lead -- 39-31 -- on a three-point play by freshman Kyler Edwards. Edwards drove hard from the left baseline and moved the ball from his right to left hand, putting it off the glass as he was fouled.On the next possession, Mooney connected on a 3-ball from the wing and after a Michigan State turnover, the senior transfer drilled another to stake Texas Tech to a 45-33 advantage, prompting a red-faced Tom Izzo to call timeout.Most of the damage was done while Culver watched from the bench with three fouls.Suffocating defense won the first half on either end and neither team could find its legs. Only 15 of 49 field-goal attempts went through, and Texas Tech led 23-21 at the break.--By Jeff Reynolds, Field Level MediaAdvertisement
