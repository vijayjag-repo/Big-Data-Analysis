Instead, Virginia held on for an 80-75 win in overtime on March 30.In a Twitter post, Edwards handed out thank-yous all around, and then said, "For as long as I can remember, it has been a dream to play in the NBA. I feel that the time is now," adding that he is "ready for the next chapter in my life."Edwards led the Big Ten Conference in scoring, averaging 24.3 points, and he also tallied 3.6 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game this season. He was a consensus second-team All-America selection.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
