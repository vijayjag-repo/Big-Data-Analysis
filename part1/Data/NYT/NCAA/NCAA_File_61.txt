The shot snapped a drought of more than five minutes by the Cavaliers, who then sent Jared Harper to the line with 7 seconds left.Harper made one and Auburn, with fouls to give, did so twice. With 1.5 seconds left, Virginia (34-3) got the ball to Guy in the corner. He turned and fired and Samir Doughty, hands straight up in the air, bumped into Guy's hip.When the whistle blew, Auburn coach Bruce Pearl lost it on the sideline, pumping his fist and screaming.Guy swished the first two free throws to tie it and Auburn (30-10) called a timeout to ice him. Didn't work. He hit one more for the lead. Auburn threw a long inbound pass to Brown, but his desperation 3 was short.___Advertisement
