"I have had a basketball in my hand basically since the day I was born. My dream has always been to play in the NBA. Therefore, after speaking with my family and coaches and giving it a lot of thought, I know it's the right time to announce that I will be entering the NBA draft and signing with an agent."Jerome knows it's the right time because he's "as ready as I'm going to be," he said in a subsequent interview with Sports Illustrated.Jerome averaged 13.6 points, 5.5 assists and 4.2 rebounds per game last season. He was Virginia's primary ballhandler but was technically the starting 2-guard for the Cavaliers. He said he patterns his game after a combination of Steve Nash and Klay Thompson.The Cavaliers are bracing to lose Jerome and sophomore forward De'Andre Hunter from a team that lost only three games last season.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
